OF THE U.S. EXPLORING EXPEDITION," ETC.</p>

<p>PREFACE.</p>

<p>The aboriginal composition now presented to the public has
some peculiar<br>
claims on the attention of scholars. As a record, if we accept
the<br>
chronology of its custodians,&mdash;which there is no reason to
question,&mdash;it<br>
carries back the authentic history of Northern America to a
date<br>
anterior by fifty years to the arrival of Columbus. Further than
this,<br>
the plain and credible tradition of the Iroquois, confirmed by
much<br>
other evidence, links them with the still earlier Alligewi,
or<br>
"Moundbuilders," as conquerors with the conquered. Thus the
annals of<br>
this portion of the continent need no longer begin with the
landing of<br>
the first colonists, but can go back, like those of Mexico,
Yucatan and<br>
Peru, to a storied past of singular interest.</p>

<p>The chief value of the Book of Rites, however, is
ethnological, and is<br>
found in the light which it casts on the political and social
life, as<br>
well as on the character and capacity of the people to whom
it<br>
belongs. We see in them many of the traits which Tacitus
discerned in<br>
our ancestors of the German forests, along with some qualities of
a<br>
higher cast than any that he has delineated. The love of peace,
the<br>
sentiment of human brotherhood, the strong social and
domestic<br>
affections, the respect for law, and the reverence for
ancestral<br>
greatness, which are apparent in this Indian record and in
the<br>
historical events which illustrate it, will strike most readers
as new<br>
and unexpected developments.</p>

<p>The circumstances attending the composition of this record and
its<br>
recent discovery are fully detailed in the introductory chapters.
There<br>
also, and in the Notes and Appendix, such further explanations
are given<br>
as the various allusions and occasional obscurities of the Indian
work<br>
have seemed to require. It is proper to state that the
particulars<br>
comprised in the following pages respecting the traditions, the
usages,<br>
and the language of the Iroquois (except such as are expressly
stated to<br>
have been derived from books), have been gathered by the writer
in the<br>
course of many visits made, during several years past, to
their<br>
Reservations in Canada and New York. As a matter of justice, and
also as<br>
an evidence of the authenticity of these particulars, the names
of the<br>
informants to whom he has been principally indebted are given in
the<br>
proper places, with suitable acknowledgment of the assistance
received<br>
from each. He ventures to hope that in the information thus
obtained, as<br>
well as in the Book of Rite's itself, the students of history and
of the<br>
science of man will find some new material of permanent interest
and<br>
value.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>THE HURON-IROQUOIS NATIONS.</p>

<p>At the outset of the sixteenth century, when the five tribes
or<br>
"nations" of the Iroquois confederacy first became known to
European<br>
explorers, they were found occupying the valleys and uplands of
northern<br>
New York, in that picturesque and fruitful region which
stretches<br>
westward from the head-waters of the Hudson to the Genesee. The
Mohawks,<br>
or Caniengas&mdash;as they should properly be called&mdash;possessed the
Mohawk<br>
River, and covered Lake George and Lake Champlain with their
flotillas<br>
of large canoes, managed with the boldness and skill which,
hereditary<br>
in their descendants, make them still the best boatmen of the
North<br>
American rivers. West of the Caniengas the Oneidas held the small
river<br>
and lake which bear their name, the first in that series of
beautiful<br>
lakes, united by interlacing streams, which seemed to prefigure
in the<br>
features of nature the political constitution of the tribes
who<br>
possessed them. West of the Oneidas, the imperious Onondagas,
the<br>
central and, in some respects, the ruling nation of the
League,<br>
possessed the two lakes of Onondaga and Skeneateles, together
with the<br>
common outlet of this inland lake system, the Oswego River, to
its issue<br>
into Lake Ontario. Still proceeding westward, the lines of trail
and<br>
river led to the long and winding stretch of Lake Cayuga, about
which<br>
were clustered the towns of the people who gave their name to the
lake;<br>
and beyond them, over the wide expanse of hills and dales
surrounding<br>
Lakes Seneca and Canandaigua, were scattered the populous
villages of<br>
the Senecas, more correctly styled Sonontowanas or Mountaineers.
Such<br>
were the names and abodes of the allied nations, members of
the<br>
far-famed Kanonsionni, or League of United Households, who were
destined<br>
to become for a time the most notable and powerful community
among the<br>
native tribes of North America. [Footnote: See Appendix, note A,
for the<br>
origin and meaning of the names commonly given to the Iroquois
nations.]</p>

<p>The region which has been described was not, however, the
original seat<br>
of those nations. They belonged to that linguistic family which
is known<br>
to ethnologists as the Huron-Iroquois stock. This stock comprised
the<br>
Hurons or Wyandots, the Attiwandaronks or Neutral Nation, the
Iroquois,<br>
the Eries, the Andastes or Conestogas, the Tuscaroras, and some
smaller<br>
bands. The tribes of this family occupied a long, irregular area
of<br>
inland territory, stretching from Canada to North Carolina. The
northern<br>
nations were all clustered about the great lakes; the southern
bands<br>
held the fertile valleys bordering the head-waters of the rivers
which<br>
flowed from the Allegheny mountains. The languages of all these
tribes<br>
showed a close affinity. There can be no doubt that their
ancestors<br>
formed one body, and, indeed, dwelt at one time (as has been well
said<br>
of the ancestors of the IndoEuropean populations), under one
roof. There<br>
was a Huron-Iroquois "family-pair," from which all these tribes
were<br>
descended. In what part of the world this ancestral household
resided is<br>
a question which admits of no reply, except from the merest<br>
conjecture. But the evidence of language, so far as it has yet
been<br>
examined, seems to show that the Huron clans were the older
members of<br>
the group; and the clear and positive traditions of all the
surviving<br>
tribes, Hurons, Iroquois and Tuscaroras, point to the lower St.
Lawrence<br>
as the earliest known abode of their stock. [Footnote: See
Cusick,<br>
<i>History of the Six Nations</i>, p. 16; Colden, <i>Hist, of the
Five<br>
Nations</i>, p. 23; Morgan, <i>League of the Iroquois</i>, p.
5;<br>
J.V.H. Clark, <i>Onondaga</i>, vol. I, p. 34; Peter D.
Clarke,<br>
<i>Hist. of the Wyandots</i>. p. I.]</p>

<p>Here the first explorer, Cartier, found Indians of this stock
at<br>
Hochelaga and Stadacon&eacute;, now the sites of Montreal and
Quebec.<br>
Centuries before his time, according to the native tradition,
the<br>
ancestors of the Huron-Iroquois family had dwelt in this
locality, or<br>
still further east and nearer to the river's mouth. As their
numbers<br>
increased, dissensions arose. The hive swarmed, and band after
band<br>
moved off to the west and south.</p>

<p>As they spread, they encountered people of other stocks, with
whom they<br>
had frequent wars. Their most constant and most dreaded enemies
were the<br>
tribes of the Algonkin family, a fierce and restless people, of
northern<br>
origin, who everywhere surrounded them. At one period, however,
if the<br>
concurrent traditions of both Iroquois and Algonkins can be
believed,<br>
these contending races for a time stayed their strife, and united
their<br>
forces in an alliance against a common and formidable foe. This
foe was<br>
the nation, or perhaps the confederacy, of the Alligewi or
Talligewi,<br>
the semi-civilized "Mound-builders" of the Ohio Valley, who have
left<br>
their name to the Allegheny river and mountains, and whose
vast<br>
earthworks are still, after half-a-century of study, the
perplexity of<br>
archaeologists. A desperate warfare ensued, which lasted about a
hundred<br>
years, and ended in the complete overthrow and destruction,
or<br>
expulsion, of the Alligewi. The survivors of the conquered people
fled<br>
southward, and are supposed to have mingled with the tribes
which<br>
occupied the region extending from the Gulf of Mexico northward
to the<br>
Tennessee river and the southern spurs of the Alleghenies. Among
these<br>
tribes, the Choctaws retained, to recent times, the custom of
raising<br>
huge mounds of earth for religious purposes and for the sites of
their<br>
habitations, a custom which they perhaps learned from the
Alligewi; and<br>
the Cherokees are supposed by some to have preserved in their
name<br>
(Tsalaki) and in their language indications of an origin derived
in part<br>
from the same people. Their language, which shows, in its grammar
and<br>
many of its words, clear evidence of affinity with the Iroquois,
has<br>
drawn the greater portion of its vocabulary from some foreign<br>
source. This source is conjectured to have been the speech of
the<br>
Alligewi. As the Cherokee tongue is evidently a mixed language,
it is<br>
reasonable to suppose that the Cherokees are a mixed people,
and<br>
probably, like the English, an amalgamation of conquering and
conquered<br>
races. [Footnote: This question has been discussed by the writer
in a<br>
paper on "Indian Migrations as evidenced by Language," read
before the<br>
American Association for the Advancement of Science, at their
Montreal<br>
Meeting, in August, 1882, and published in the American
Antiquarian for<br>
January and April, 1883.]</p>

<p>The time which has elapsed since the overthrow of the Alligewi
is<br>
variously estimated. The most probable conjecture places it at a
period<br>
about a thousand years before the present day. It was apparently
soon<br>
after their expulsion that the tribes of the Huron-Iroquois and
the<br>
Algonkin stocks scattered themselves over the wide region south
of the<br>
Great Lakes, thus left open to their occupancy. Our concern at
present<br>
is only with the first-named family. The native tradition of
their<br>
migrations has been briefly related by a Tuscarora Indian, David
Cusick,<br>
who had acquired a sufficient education to become a Baptist
preacher,<br>
and has left us, in his "Sketches of Ancient History of the
Six<br>
Nations," [Footnote: Published at Lewiston, N. Y., in 1825,
and<br>
reprinted at Lockport, in 1848. ] a record of singular value.
His<br>
confused and imperfect style, the English of a half-educated
foreigner,<br>
his simple faith in the wildest legends, and his absurd
chronology, have<br>
caused the real worth of his book, as a chronicle of native
traditions,<br>
to be overlooked. Wherever the test of linguistic evidence, the
best of<br>
all proofs in ethnological questions, can be applied to his
statements<br>
relative to the origin and connection of the tribes, they are
invariably<br>
confirmed. From his account, from the evidence of language, and
from<br>
various corroborating indications, the course of the migrations
may, it<br>
is believed, be traced with tolerable accuracy. Their first
station or<br>
starting point, on the south side of the Lakes, was at the mouth
of the<br>
Oswego river. Advancing to the southeast the emigrants struck the
Hudson<br>
river, and, according to Cusick's story, followed its course
southward<br>
to the ocean. Here a separation took place. A portion remained,
and kept<br>
on their way toward the south; but the "main company," repelled
by the<br>
uninviting soil and the turbulent waste of waves, and remembering
the<br>
attractive region of valleys, lakes, and streams through which
they had<br>
passed, retraced their steps northward till they reached the
Mohawk<br>
river. Along this stream and the upper waters of the Hudson they
made<br>
their first abode; and here they remained until, as their
historian<br>
quaintly and truly records, "their language was altered." The
Huron<br>
speech became the Iroquois tongue, in the form in which it is
spoken by<br>
the Caniengas, or Mohawks. In Iroquois tradition, and in the<br>
constitution of their league, the Canienga nation ranks as the
"eldest<br>
brother" of the family. A comparison of the dialects proves
the<br>
tradition to be well founded. The Canienga language approaches
nearest<br>
to the Huron, and is undoubtedly the source from which all the
other<br>
Iroquois dialects are derived. Cusick states positively that the
other<br>
"families," as he styles them, of the Iroquois household, leaving
the<br>
Mohawks in their original abode, proceeded step by step to the
westward.<br>
The Oneidas halted at their creek, the Onondagas at their
mountain, the<br>
Cayugas at their lake, and the Senecas or Sonontowans, the Great
Hill<br>
people, at a lofty eminence which rises south of the
Canandaigua<br>
lake. In due time, as he is careful to record, the same result
happened<br>
as had occurred with the Caniengas. The language of each canton
"was<br>
altered;" yet not so much, he might have added, but that all the
tribes<br>
could still hold intercourse, and comprehend one another's
speech.</p>

<p>A wider isolation and, consequently, a somewhat greater change
of<br>
language, befell the "sixth family." Pursuing their course to the
west<br>
they touched Lake Erie, and thence, turning to the southeast,
came to<br>
the Allegheny river. Cusick, however, does not know it by this
name. He<br>
calls it the Ohio,&mdash;in his uncouth orthography and with a
locative<br>
particle added, the Ouau-we-yo-ka,&mdash;which, he says, means "a
principal<br>
stream, now Mississippi." This statement, unintelligible as at
the first<br>
glance it seems, is strictly accurate. The word Ohio
undoubtedly<br>
signified, in the ancient Iroquois speech, as it still means in
the<br>
modern Tuscarora, not "beautiful river", but "great river."
[Footnote:<br>
See Appendix, note B.] It was so called as being the main stream
which<br>
receives the affluents of the Ohio valley. In the view of the
Iroquois,<br>
this "main stream" commences with what we call the Allegheny
river,<br>
continues in what we term the Ohio, and then flows on in what we
style<br>
the Mississippi,&mdash;of which, in their view, the upper Mississippi
is<br>
merely an affluent. In Iroquois hydrography, the Ohio&mdash;the great
river<br>
of the ancient Alligewi domain&mdash;is the central stream to which
all the<br>
rivers of the mighty West converge.</p>

<p>This stream the emigrants now attempted to cross. They found,
according<br>
to the native annalist, a rude bridge in a huge grape-vine which
trailed<br>
its length across the stream. Over this a part of the company
passed,<br>
and then, unfortunately, the vine broke. The residue, unable to
cross,<br>
remained on the hither side, and became afterwards the enemies of
those<br>
who had passed over. Cusick anticipates that his story of the
grape-vine<br>
may seem to some incredible; but he asks, with amusing
simplicity, "why<br>
more so than that the Israelites should cross the Red Sea on dry
land?"<br>
That the precise incident, thus frankly admitted to be of a
miraculous<br>
character, really took place, we are not required to believe. But
that<br>
emigrants of the Huron-Iroquois stock penetrated southward along
the<br>
Allegheny range, and that some of them remained near the river of
that<br>
name, is undoubted fact. Those who thus remained were known by
various<br>
names, mostly derived from one root&mdash;Andastes, Andastogues,
Conestogas,<br>
and the like&mdash;and bore a somewhat memorable part in Iroquois
and<br>
Pennsylvanian history. Those who continued their course beyond
the river<br>
found no place sufficiently inviting to arrest their march until
they<br>
arrived at the fertile vales which spread, intersected by many
lucid<br>
streams, between the Roanoke and the Neuse rivers. Here they
fixed their<br>
abode, and became the ancestors of the powerful Tuscarora nation.
In the<br>
early part of the eighteenth century, just before its disastrous
war<br>
with the colonies, this nation, according to the Carolina
surveyor,<br>
Lawson, numbered fifteen towns, and could set in the field a
force of<br>
twelve hundred warriors.</p>

<p>The Eries, who dwelt west of the Senecas, along the southern
shore of<br>
the lake which now retains their name, were according to Cusick,
an<br>
offshoot of the Seneca tribe; and there is no reason for doubting
the<br>
correctness of his statement. After their overthrow by the
Iroquois, in<br>
1656, many of the Eries were incorporated with the ancestral
nation, and<br>
contributed, with other accessions from the Hurons and the<br>
Attiwandaronks, to swell its numbers far beyond those of the
other<br>
nations of the confederacy.</p>

<p>To conclude this review of the Huron-Iroquois group, something
further<br>
should be said about the fortunes of the parent tribe, or
rather<br>
congeries of tribes,&mdash;for the Huron household, like the Iroquois,
had<br>
become divided into several septs. Like the Iroquois, also, they
have<br>
not lacked an annalist of their own race. A Wyandot Indian,
Peter<br>
Doyentate Clarke, who emigrated with the main body of his people
to the<br>
Indian Territory, and afterwards returned for a time to the
remnant of<br>
his tribe dwelling near Amherstburg, in Canada, published in 1870
a<br>
small volume entitled "Origin and Traditional History of the
Wyandots."<br>
[Footnote: Printed by Hunter, Rose &amp; Co., of Toronto.] The
English<br>
education of the writer, like that of the Tuscarora historian,
was<br>
defective; and it is evident that his people, in their many
wanderings,<br>
had lost much of their legendary lore. But the fact that they
resided<br>
in ancient times near the present site of Montreal, in close
vicinity to<br>
the Iroquois (whom he styles, after their largest tribe, the
Senecas),<br>
is recorded as a well-remembered portion of their history. The
flight of<br>
the Wyandots to the northwest is declared to have been caused by
a war<br>
which broke out between them and the Iroquois. This statement
is<br>
opposed to the common opinion, which ascribes the expulsion of
the<br>
Hurons from their eastern abode to the hostility of the
Algonkins. It<br>
is, however, probably correct; for the Hurons retreated into the
midst<br>
of the Algonkin tribes, with whom they were found by Champlain to
be on<br>
terms of amity and even of alliance, while they were engaged in a
deadly<br>
war with the Iroquois. The place to which they withdrew was a
nook in<br>
the Georgian Bay, where their strongly palisaded towns and<br>
well-cultivated fields excited the admiration of the great
French<br>
explorer. Their object evidently was to place as wide a space
as<br>
possible between themselves and their inveterate enemies.
Unfortunately,<br>
as is well known, this precaution, and even the aid of their
Algonkin<br>
and French allies, proved inadequate to save them. The story of
their<br>
disastrous overthrow, traced by the masterly hand of Parkman, is
one of<br>
the most dismal passages of aboriginal history.</p>

<p>The only people of this stock remaining to be noticed are
the<br>
Attiwandaronks, or Neutral Nation. They dwelt south of the
Hurons, on<br>
the northern borders of Lakes Erie and Ontario. They had, indeed,
a few<br>
towns beyond those lakes, situated east of the Niagara river,
between<br>
the Iroquois and the Eries. They received their name of Neutrals
from<br>
the fact that in the war between the Iroquois and the Hurons
they<br>
remained at peace with both parties. This policy, however, did
not save<br>
them from the fate which overtook their Huron friends. In the
year 1650<br>
the Iroquois set upon them, destroyed their towns, and dispersed
the<br>
inhabitants, carrying off great numbers of them, as was their
custom, to<br>
be incorporated with their own population. Of their language we
only<br>
know that it differed but slightly from the Huron. [Footnote:
"Our<br>
Hurons call the Neutral Nation Attiwandaronk, meaning thereby
'People of<br>
a speech a little different.'"&mdash;<i>Relation</i> of 1641, p. 72.
Bruyas,<br>
in his "<i>Iroquois Root-words</i>" gives <i>gawenda</i> (or<br>
<i>gawenna</i>), speech, and <i>gaRONKwestare</i>, confusion
of<br>
voices. ] Whether they were an offshoot from the Hurons or from
the<br>
Iroquois is uncertain. It is not unlikely that their separation
from the<br>
parent stock took place earlier than that of the Iroquois, and
that they<br>
were thus enabled for a time to avoid becoming embroiled in the
quarrel<br>
between the two great divisions of their race.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>THE LEAGUE AND ITS FOUNDERS.</p>

<p>How long the five kindred but independent tribes who were
afterwards to<br>
compose the Iroquois confederacy remained isolated and apart from
one<br>
another, is uncertain. That this condition endured for
several<br>
centuries is a fact which cannot be questioned. Tradition here
is<br>
confirmed by the evidence of language. We have good dictionaries
of two<br>
of their dialects, the Canienga (or Mohawk) and the Onondaga,
compiled<br>
two centuries ago by the Jesuit missionaries; and by comparing
them with<br>
vocabularies of the same dialects, as spoken at the present day,
we can<br>
ascertain the rate of change which prevails in their languages.
Judging<br>
by this test, the difference which existed between these two
dialects in<br>
1680 (when the Jesuit dictionaries were written) could hardly
have<br>
arisen in less than four hundred years; and that which exists
between<br>
them and the Tuscarora would demand a still longer time.
Their<br>
traditions all affirm&mdash;what we should be prepared to
believe&mdash;that this<br>
period was one of perpetual troubles. The tribes were constantly
at war,<br>
either among themselves, or with the neighboring nations of their
own<br>
and other stocks, Hurons, Andastes, Algonkins, Tuteloes, and even
with<br>
the distant Cherokees.</p>

<p>There are reasons for believing that attempts were made during
this<br>
period to combine the tribes, or some of them, in a federal<br>
alliance. But if such connections were formed, they proved
only<br>
temporary leagues, which were dissolved when the dangers that had
called<br>
them into being had passed away. A leader of peculiar qualities,
aided<br>
by favoring circumstances, was able at last to bring about a
more<br>
permanent union. There is no exact chronology by which the date
of this<br>
important event can be ascertained; but the weight of evidence
fixes it<br>
at about the middle of the fifteenth century. [Footnote: The
evidence on<br>
this point is given in the Appendix, note C. It should be
mentioned that<br>
some portion of the following narrative formed part of a paper
entitled<br>
"A Lawgiver of the Stone Age," which was read at the Cincinnati
meeting<br>
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in
August,<br>
1882, and was published in the Proceedings of the meeting.
The<br>
particulars comprised in it were drawn chiefly from notes
gathered<br>
during many visits to the Reserve of the Six Nations, on the
Grand<br>
River, in Ontario, supplemented by information obtained in two
visits to<br>
the Onondaga Reservation, in the State of New York, near
Syracuse. My<br>
informants were the most experienced councillors, and especially
the<br>
"wampum-keepers," the official annalists of their people. Their
names,<br>
and some account of them, will be given in a subsequent chapter.
It<br>
should be mentioned that while the histories received at the
two<br>
localities were generally in close accord, thus furnishing a
strong<br>
proof of the correctness with which they have been handed down,
there<br>
were circumstances remembered at each place which had not been
preserved<br>
at the other. The Onondagas, as was natural, retained a
fuller<br>
recollection of the events which took place before the flight
of<br>
Hiawatha to the Caniengas; while the annalists of the latter
tribe were<br>
better versed in the subsequent occurrences attending the
formation of<br>
the League. These facts should be borne in mind by any inquirer
who may<br>
undertake to repeat or continue these investigations. When
the<br>
narratives varied, as they sometimes did in minor particulars, I
have<br>
followed that which seemed most in accordance with the general
tenor of<br>
the history and with the evidence furnished by the Book of
Rites.]</p>

<p>At this time two great dangers, the one from without, the
other from<br>
within, pressed upon these tribes. The Mohegans, or Mohicans, a
powerful<br>
Algonkin people, whose settlements stretched along the Hudson
river,<br>
south of the Mohawk, and extended thence eastward into New
England,<br>
waged a desperate war against them. In this war the most easterly
of the<br>
Iroquois, the Caniengas and Oneidas, bore the brunt and were
the<br>
greatest sufferers. On the other hand, the two western nations,
the<br>
Senecas and Cayugas, had a peril of their own to encounter. The
central<br>
nation, the Onondagas, were then under the control of a dreaded
chief,<br>
whose name is variously given, Atotarho (or, with a prefixed
particle,<br>
Thatotarho), Watatotahro, Tadodaho, according to the dialect of
the<br>
speaker and the orthography of the writer. He was a man of great
force<br>
of character and of formidable qualities&mdash;haughty, ambitious,
crafty and<br>
bold&mdash;a determined and successful warrior, and at home, so far as
the<br>
constitution of an Indian tribe would allow, a stern and
remorseless<br>
tyrant. He tolerated no equal. The chiefs who ventured to oppose
him<br>
were taken off one after another by secret means, or were
compelled to<br>
flee for safety to other tribes. His subtlety and artifices had
acquired<br>
for him the reputation of a wizard. He knew, they say, what was
going on<br>
at a distance as well as if he were present; and he could destroy
his<br>
enemies by some magical art, while he himself was far away. In
spite of<br>
the fear which he inspired, his domination would probably not
have been<br>
endured by an Indian community, but for his success in war. He
had made<br>
himself and his people a terror to the Cayugas and the
Senecas.<br>
According to one account, he had subdued both of those tribes;
but the<br>
record-keepers of the present day do not confirm this statement,
which<br>
indeed is not consistent with the subsequent history of the<br>
confederation.</p>

<p>The name Atotarho signifies "entangled." The usual process by
which<br>
mythology, after a few generations, makes fables out of names,
has not<br>
been wanting here. In the legends which the Indian story-fellers
recount<br>
in winter, about their cabin fires, Atotarho figures as a being
of<br>
preterhuman nature, whose head, in lieu of hair, is adorned with
living<br>
snakes. A rude pictorial representation shows him seated and
giving<br>
audience, in horrible state, with the upper part of his person
enveloped<br>
by these writhing and entangled reptiles. [Footnote: This picture
and<br>
some other equally grotesque illustrations, produced in a
primitive<br>
style of wood engraving, are prefixed to David Cusick's History
of the<br>
Six Nations. The artist to whom we owe them was probably the
historian<br>
himself. My accomplished friend, Mrs. E. A. Smith, whose studies
have<br>
thrown much light upon the mythology and language of the
Iroquois<br>
nations, and especially of the Tuscaroras, was fortunate enough
to<br>
obtain either the originals or early copies of these
extraordinary<br>
efforts of native art.] But the grave Councillors of the
Canadian<br>
Reservation, who recite his history as they have heard it from
their<br>
fathers at every installation of a high chief, do not repeat
these<br>
inventions of marvel-loving gossips, and only smile with
good-humored<br>
derision when they are referred to.</p>

<p>There was at this time among the Onondagas a chief of high
rank, whose<br>
name, variously written&mdash;Hiawatha, Hayenwatha, Ayonhwahtha,<br>
Taoungwatha&mdash;is rendered, "he who seeks the wampum belt." He had
made<br>
himself greatly esteemed by his wisdom and his benevolence. He
was now<br>
past middle age. Though many of his friends and relatives had
perished<br>
by the machinations of Atotarho, he himself had been spared.
The<br>
qualities which gained him general respect had, perhaps, not
been<br>
without influence even on that redoubtable chief. Hiawatha had
long<br>
beheld with grief the evils which afflicted not only his own
nation, but<br>
all the other tribes about them, through the continual wars in
which<br>
they were engaged, and the misgovernment and miseries at home
which<br>
these wars produced. With much meditation he had elaborated in
his mind<br>
the scheme of a vast confederation which would ensure
universal<br>
peace. In the mere plan of a confederation there was nothing new.
There<br>
are probably few, if any, Indian tribes which have not, at one
time or<br>
another, been members of a league or confederacy. It may almost
be said<br>
to be their normal condition. But the plan which Hiawatha had
evolved<br>
differed from all others in two particulars. The system which he
devised<br>
was to be not a loose and transitory league, but a permanent
government.<br>
While each nation was to retain its own council and its
management of<br>
local affairs, the general control was to be lodged in a federal
senate,<br>
composed of representatives elected by each nation, holding
office<br>
during good behavior, and acknowledged as ruling chiefs
throughout the<br>
whole confederacy. Still further, and more remarkably, the<br>
confederation was not to be a limited one. It was to be
indefinitely<br>
expansible. The avowed design of its proposer was to abolish
war<br>
altogether. He wished the federation to extend until all the
tribes of<br>
men should be included in it, and peace should everywhere reign.
Such is<br>
the positive testimony of the Iroquois themselves; and their
statement,<br>
as will be seen, is supported by historical evidence.</p>

<p>Hiawatha's first endeavor was to enlist his own nation in the
cause. He<br>
summoned a meeting of the chiefs and people of the Onondaga
towns. The<br>
summons, proceeding from a chief of his rank and reputation,
attracted a<br>
large concourse. "They came together," said the narrator, "along
the<br>
creeks, from all parts, to the general council-fire." [Footnote:
The<br>
narrator here referred to was the Onondaga chief, Philip Jones,
known in<br>
the council as Hanesehen (in Canienga, Enneserarenh), who, in
October,<br>
1875, with two other chiefs of high rank, and the interpreter,
Daniel La<br>
Fort, spent an evening in explaining to me the wampum records
preserved<br>
at "Onondaga Castle," and repeating the history of the formation
of the<br>
confederacy. The later portions of the narrative were
obtained<br>
principally from the chiefs of the Canadian Iroquois, as will
be<br>
hereafter explained.] But what effect the grand projects of the
chief,<br>
enforced by the eloquence for which he was noted, might have had
upon<br>
his auditors, could not be known. For there appeared among them
a<br>
well-known figure, grim, silent and forbidding, whose terrible
aspect<br>
overawed the assemblage. The unspoken displeasure of Atotarho
was<br>
sufficient to stifle all debate, and the meeting dispersed.
This<br>
result, which seems a singular conclusion of an Indian
council&mdash;the most<br>
independent and free-spoken of all gatherings&mdash;is sufficiently
explained<br>
by the fact that Atotarho had organized, among the more
reckless<br>
warriors of his tribe, a band of unscrupulous partisans, who did
his<br>
bidding without question, and took off by secret murder all
persons<br>
against whom he bore a grudge. The knowledge that his followers
were<br>
scattered through the assembly, prepared to mark for destruction
those<br>
who should offend him, might make the boldest orator chary of<br>
speech. Hiawatha alone was undaunted. He summoned a second
meeting,<br>
which was attended by a smaller number, and broke up as before,
in<br>
confusion, on Atotarho's appearance. The unwearied reformer sent
forth<br>
his runners a third time; but the people were disheartened. When
the<br>
day of the council arrived, no one attended. Then, continued
the<br>
narrator, Hiawatha seated himself on the ground in sorrow. He
enveloped<br>
his head in his mantle of skins, and remained for a long time
bowed down<br>
in grief and thought. At length he arose and left the town,
taking his<br>
course toward the southeast. He had formed a bold design. As
the<br>
councils of his own nation were closed to him, he would have
recourse to<br>
those of other tribes. At a short distance from the town (so
minutely<br>
are the circumstances recounted) he passed his great antagonist,
seated<br>
near a well-known spring, stern and silent as usual. No word
passed<br>
between the determined representatives of war and peace; but it
was<br>
doubtless not without a sensation of triumphant pleasure that
the<br>
ferocious war-chief saw his only rival and opponent in council
going<br>
into what seemed to be voluntary exile. Hiawatha plunged into
the<br>
forest; he climbed mountains; he crossed a lake; he floated down
the<br>
Mohawk river in a canoe. Many incidents of his journey are told,
and in<br>
this part of the narrative alone some occurrences of a marvelous
cast<br>
are related, even by the official historians. Indeed, the flight
of<br>
Hiawatha from Onondaga to the country of the Caniengas is to the
Five<br>
Nations what the flight of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina is to
the<br>
votaries of Islam. It is the turning point of their history.
In<br>
embellishing the narrative at this point, their imagination has
been<br>
allowed a free course. Leaving aside these marvels, however, we
need<br>
only refer here to a single incident, which may well enough have
been of<br>
actual occurrence. A lake which Hiawatha crossed had shores
abounding in<br>
small white shells. These he gathered and strung upon strings,
which he<br>
disposed upon his breast, as a token to all whom he should meet
that he<br>
came as a messenger of peace. And this, according to one
authority, was<br>
the origin of wampum, of which Hiawatha was the inventor. That
honor,<br>
however, is one which must be denied to him. The evidence of
sepulchral<br>
relics shows that wampum was known to the mysterious
Mound-builders, as<br>
well as in all succeeding ages. Moreover, if the significance of
white<br>
wampum-strings as a token of peace had not been well known in his
day,<br>
Hiawatha would not have relied upon them as a means of
proclaiming his<br>
pacific purpose.</p>

<p>Early one morning he arrived at a Canienga town, the residence
of the<br>
noted chief Dekanawidah, whose name, in point of celebrity, ranks
in<br>
Iroquois tradition with those of Hiawatha and Atotarho. It is
probable<br>
that he was known by reputation to Hiawatha, and not unlikely
that they<br>
were related. According to one account Dekanawidah was an
Onondaga,<br>
adopted among the Caniengas. Another narrative makes him a
Canienga by<br>
birth. The probability seems to be that he was the son of an
Onondaga<br>
father, who had been adopted by the Caniengas, and of a
Canienga<br>
mother. That he was not of pure Canienga blood is shown by the
fact,<br>
which is remembered, that his father had had successively three
wives,<br>
one belonging to each of the three clans, Bear, Wolf, and
Tortoise,<br>
which composed the Canienga nation. If the father had been of
that<br>
nation (Canienga), he would have belonged to one of the Canienga
clans,<br>
and could not then (according to the Indian law) have married
into it.<br>
He had seven sons, including Dekanawidah, who, with their
families,<br>
dwelt together in one of the "long houses" common in that day
among the<br>
Iroquois. These ties of kindred, together with this fraternal
strength,<br>
and his reputation as a sagacious councillor, gave Dekanawidah
great<br>
influence among his people. But, in the Indian sense, he was not
the<br>
leading chief. This position belonged to Tekarihoken (better
known in<br>
books as Tecarihoga), whose primacy as the first chief of the
eldest<br>
among the Iroquois nations was then, and is still,
universally<br>
admitted. Each nation has always had a head-chief, to whom
belonged the<br>
hereditary right and duty of lighting the council fire and taking
the<br>
first place in public meetings. But among the Indians, as in
other<br>
communities, hereditary rank and personal influence do not
always, or<br>
indeed, ordinarily, go together. If Hiawatha could gain over
Dekanawidah<br>
to his views, he would have done much toward the accomplishment
of his<br>
purposes.</p>

<p>In the early dawn he seated himself on a fallen trunk, near
the spring<br>
from which the inhabitants of the long house drew their water.
Presently<br>
the wife of one of the brothers came out with a vessel of
elm-bark, and<br>
approached the spring. Hiawatha sat silent and motionless.
Something in<br>
his aspect awed the woman, who feared to address him. She
returned to<br>
the house, and said to Dekanawidah, "A man, or a figure like a
man, is<br>
seated by the spring, having his breast covered with strings of
white<br>
shells." "It is a guest," said the chief to one of his brothers;
"go and<br>
bring him in. We will make him welcome." Thus Hiawatha and<br>
Dekanawidah&mdash;first met. They found in each other kindred spirits.
The<br>
sagacity of the Canienga chief grasped at once the advantages of
the<br>
proposed plan, and the two worked together in perfecting it, and
in<br>
commending it to the people. After much discussion in council,
the<br>
adhesion of the Canienga nation was secured. Dekanawidah then
dispatched<br>
two of his brothers as ambassadors to the nearest tribe, the
Oneidas, to<br>
lay the project before them. The Oneida nation is deemed to be
a<br>
comparatively recent offshoot from the Caniengas. The difference
of<br>
language is slight, showing that their separation was much later
than<br>
that of the Onondagas. In the figurative speech of the Iroquois,
the<br>
Oneida is the son, and the Onondaga is the brother, of the<br>
Canienga. Dekanawidah had good reason to expect that it would not
prove<br>
difficult to win the consent of the Oneidas to the proposed
scheme. But<br>
delay and deliberation mark all public acts of the Indians.
The<br>
ambassadors found the leading chief, Odatsehte, at his town on
the<br>
Oneida creek. He received their message in a friendly way,
but&mdash;required<br>
time for his people to consider it in council. "Come back in
another<br>
day," he said to the messengers. In the political speech of the
Indians,<br>
a day is understood to mean a year. The envoys carried back the
reply to<br>
Dekanawidah and Hiawatha, who knew that they could do nothing but
wait<br>
the prescribed time. After the lapse of a year, they repaired to
the<br>
place of meeting. The treaty which initiated the great league was
then<br>
and there ratified by the representatives of the Canienga and
Oneida<br>
nations. The name of Odatsehte means "the quiver-bearer;" and
as<br>
Atotarho, "the entangled," is fabled to have had his head
wreathed with<br>
snaky locks, and as Hiawatha, "the wampum-seeker," is represented
to<br>
have wrought shells into wampum, so the Oneida chief is reputed
to have<br>
appeared at this treaty bearing at his shoulder a quiver full of
arrows.</p>

<p>The Onondagas lay next to the Oneidas. To them, or rather to
their<br>
terrible chief, the next application was made. The first meeting
of<br>
Atotarho and Dekanawidah is a notable event in Iroquois history.
At a<br>
later day, a native artist sought to represent it in an
historical<br>
picture, which has been already referred to. Atotarho is seated
in<br>
solitary and surly dignity, smoking a long pipe, his head and
body<br>
encircled with contorted and angry serpents. Standing before him
are two<br>
figures which cannot be mistaken. The foremost, a plumed and
cinctured<br>
warrior, depicted as addressing the Onondaga chief, holds in his
right<br>
hand, as a staff, his flint-headed spear, the ensign, it may
be<br>
supposed, which marks him as the representative of the Caniengas,
or<br>
"People of the Flint." Behind him another plumed figure bears in
his<br>
hand a bow with arrows, and at his shoulder a quiver. Divested of
its<br>
mythological embellishments, the picture rudely represents the
interview<br>
which actually took place. The immediate result was unpromising.
The<br>
Onondaga chief coldly refused to entertain the project, which he
had<br>
already rejected when proposed by Hiawatha. The ambassadors were
not<br>
discouraged. Beyond the Onondagas were scattered the villages of
the<br>
Cayugas, a people described by the Jesuit missionaries, at a
later day,<br>
as the most mild and tractable of the Iroquois. They were
considered an<br>
offshoot of the Onondagas, to whom they bore the same filial
relation<br>
which the Oneidas bore to the Caniengas. The journey of the
advocates of<br>
peace through the forest to the Cayuga capital, and their
reception, are<br>
minutely detailed in the traditionary narrative. The Cayugas, who
had<br>
suffered from the prowess and cruelty of the Onondaga chief,
needed<br>
little persuasion. They readily consented to come into the
league, and<br>
their chief, Akahenyonk ("The Wary Spy"), joined the Canienga and
Oneida<br>
representatives in a new embassy to the Onondagas. Acting
probably upon<br>
the advice of Hiawatha, who knew better than any other the
character of<br>
the community and the chief with whom they had to deal, they
made<br>
proposals highly flattering to the self-esteem which was the
most<br>
notable trait of both ruler and people. The Onondagas should be
the<br>
leading nation of the confederacy. Their chief town should be
the<br>
federal capital, where the great councils of the league should be
held,<br>
and where its records should be preserved. The nation should
be<br>
represented in the council by fourteen senators, while no other
nation<br>
should have more than ten. And as the Onondagas should be the
leading<br>
tribe, so Atotarho should be the leading chief. He alone should
have the<br>
right of summoning the federal council, and no act of the council
to<br>
which he objected should be valid. In other words, an absolute
veto was<br>
given to him. To enhance his personal dignity, two high chiefs
were<br>
appointed as his special aids and counselors, his "Secretaries
of<br>
State," so to speak. Other insignia of preeminence were to be
possessed<br>
by him; and, in view of all these distinctions, it is not
surprising<br>
that his successor, who two centuries later retained the same<br>
prerogatives, should have been occasionally styled by the
English<br>
colonists "the Emperor of the Five Nations." It might seem,
indeed, at<br>
first thought, that the founders of the confederacy had
voluntarily<br>
placed themselves and their tribes in a position of almost
abject<br>
subserviency to Atotarho and his followers. But they knew too
well the<br>
qualities of their people to fear for them any political
subjection. It<br>
was certain that when once the league was established, and
its<br>
representatives had met in council, character and intelligence
would<br>
assume their natural sway, and mere artificial rank and dignity
would be<br>
little regarded. Atotarho and his people, however, yielded either
to<br>
these specious offers, or to the pressure which the combined
urgency of<br>
the three allied nations now brought to bear upon them. They
finally<br>
accepted the league; and the great chief, who had originally
opposed it,<br>
now naturally became eager to see it as widely extended as
possible. He<br>
advised its representatives to go on at once to the westward, and
enlist<br>
the populous Seneca towns, pointing out how this might best be
done.<br>
This advice was followed, and the adhesion of the Senecas was
secured by<br>
giving to their two leading chiefs, Kanya-dariyo ("Beautiful
Lake") and<br>
Shadekaronyes ("The Equal Skies"), the offices of military
commanders of<br>
the confederacy, with the title of doorkeepers of the
"Long-house," that<br>
being the figure by which the league was known.</p>

<p>The six national leaders who have been mentioned&mdash;Dekanawidah
for the<br>
Caniengas, Odatsehte for the Oneidas, Atotarho for the
Onondagas,<br>
Akahenyonk for the Cayugas, Kanyadariyo and Shadekaronyes for the
two<br>
great divisions of the Senecas&mdash;met in convention near the
Onondaga<br>
Lake, with Hiawatha for their adviser, and a vast concourse of
their<br>
followers, to settle the terms and rules of their confederacy,
and to<br>
nominate its first council. Of this council, nine members (or
ten, if<br>
Dekanawidah be included) were assigned to the Caniengas, a like
number<br>
to the Oneidas, fourteen to the lordly Onondagas, ten to the
Cayugas,<br>
and eight to the Senecas. Except in the way of compliment, the
number<br>
assigned to each nation was really of little consequence;
inasmuch as,<br>
by the rule of the league, unanimity was exacted in all their<br>
decisions. This unanimity, however, did not require the suffrage
of<br>
every member of the council. The representatives of each nation
first<br>
deliberated apart upon the question proposed. In this separate
council<br>
the majority decided; and the leading chief then expressed in the
great<br>
council the voice of his nation. Thus the veto of Atotarho ceased
at<br>
once to be peculiar to him, and became a right exercised by each
of the<br>
allied nations. This requirement of unanimity, embarrassing as it
might<br>
seem, did not prove to be so in practice. Whenever a question
arose on<br>
which opinions were divided, its decision was either postponed,
or some<br>
compromise was reached which left all parties contented.</p>

<p>The first members of the council were appointed by the
convention&mdash;under<br>
what precise rule is unknown; but their successors came in by a
method<br>
in which the hereditary and the elective systems were
singularly<br>
combined, and in which female suffrage had an important place.
When a<br>
chief died or (as sometimes happened) was deposed for incapacity
or<br>
misconduct, some member of the same family succeeded him. Rank
followed<br>
the female line; and this successor might be any descendant of
the late<br>
chief's mother or grandmother&mdash;his brother, his cousin or his<br>
nephew&mdash;but never his son. Among many persons who might thus
be<br>
eligible, the selection was made in the first instance by a
family<br>
council. In this council the "chief matron" of the family, a
noble dame<br>
whose position and right were well defined, had the deciding
voice. This<br>
remarkable fact is affirmed by the Jesuit mission-ary Lafitau,
and the<br>
usage remains in full vigor among the Canadian Iroquois to
this<br>
day. [Footnote: "La dignit&eacute; de chef est perpetuelle et
h&eacute;r&eacute;ditaire dans<br>
sa Cabane, passant toujours aux enfans de ses tantes, de ses
soeurs, on<br>
de ses ni&egrave;ces du c&ocirc;t&eacute; maternel. D&egrave;s
que l'arbre est tomb&eacute;, il fault,<br>
disent ils, le relever. La matrone, qui a la principale
autorit&eacute;, apr&egrave;s<br>
en avoir confer&eacute; avec ceux de sa Cabane, en conf&egrave;re
de nouveau avec ceux<br>
de sa Tribu [clan], &agrave; qui elle fait agr&eacute;er oelui
qu'elle a choisi pour<br>
succeder, ce qui lui est assez libre. Elle n'a pas toujours
&eacute;gard au<br>
droit d'ainesse, et d'ordinaire, elle prend celui qui paroit le
plus<br>
propre &agrave; so&ucirc;tenir ce rang par ses bonnes
qualit&eacute;s."&mdash;<i>Lafitau: Maurs<br>
des Savages Ameriquains</i>, p. 471.] If there are two or more
members<br>
of the family who seem to have equal claims, the nominating
matron<br>
sometimes declines to decide between them, and names them both or
all,<br>
leaving the ultimate choice to the nation or the federal council.
The<br>
council of the nation next considers the nomination, and, if<br>
dissatisfied, refers it back to the family for a new designation.
If<br>
content, the national council reports the name of the candidate
to the<br>
federal senate, in which resides the power of ratifying or
rejecting the<br>
choice of the nation; but the power of rejection is rarely
exercised,<br>
though that of expulsion for good cause is not unfrequently
exerted. The<br>
new chief inherits the name of his predecessor. In this respect,
as in<br>
some others, the resemblance of the Great Council to the English
House<br>
of Peers is striking. As Norfolk succeeds to Norfolk, so
Tekarihoken<br>
succeeds Tekarihoken. The great names of Hiawatha and Atotarho
are still<br>
borne by plain farmer-councillors on the Canadian
Reservation.</p>

<p>When the League was established, Hiawatha had been adopted by
the<br>
Canienga nation as one of their chiefs. The honor in which he was
held<br>
by them is shown by his position on the roll of councillors, as
it has<br>
been handed down from the earliest times. As the Canienga nation
is the<br>
"elder brother," the names of its chiefs are first recited. At
the head<br>
of the list is the leading Canienga chief, Tekarihoken, who
represents<br>
the noblest lineage of the Iroquois stock. Next to him, and
second on<br>
the roll, is the name of Hiawatha. That of his great
colleague,<br>
Dekanawidah, nowhere appears. He was a member of the first
council; but<br>
he forbade his people to appoint a successor to him. "Let the
others<br>
have successors," he said proudly, "for others can advise you
like<br>
them. But I am the founder of your league, and no one else can do
what I<br>
have done." [Footnote: In Mr. Morgan's admirable work, "<i>The
League of<br>
the Iroquois</i>," the list of Councillors (whom he styles<br>
<i>sachems</i>), comprises the name of Dekanawidah&mdash;in his
orthography,<br>
Daganoweda. During my last visit to my lamented friend (in
September,<br>
1880), when we examined together my copy of the then newly
discovered<br>
Book of Rites, in which he was greatly interested, this point
was<br>
considered. The original notes which he made for his work
were<br>
examined. It appeared that in the list as it was first written by
him,<br>
from the dictation of a well-informed Seneca chief, the name
of<br>
Dekanawidah was not comprised. A later, but erroneous suggestion,
from<br>
another source, led him to believe that his first informant
was<br>
mistaken, or that he had misunderstood him, and to substitute the
name<br>
of Dekanawidah for the somewhat similar name of Shatekariwate (in
Seneca<br>
Sadekeiwadeh), which stands third on the roll, immediately
following<br>
that of Hiawatha. The term <i>sachem</i>, it may be added, is
an<br>
Algonkin word, and one which Iroquois speakers have a difficulty
in<br>
pronouncing. Their own name for a member of their Senate is<br>
<i>Royaner</i>, derived from the root <i>yaner</i>, noble, and
precisely<br>
equivalent in meaning to the English "nobleman" or "lord," as
applied to<br>
a member of the House of Peers. It is the word by which the
missionaries<br>
have rendered the title "Lord" in the New Testament.]</p>

<p>The boast was not unwarranted. Though planned by another, the
structure<br>
had been reared mainly by his labors. But the Five Nations,
while<br>
yielding abundant honor to the memory of Dekanawidah, have
never<br>
regarded him with the same affectionate reverence which has
always clung<br>
to the name of Hiawatha. His tender and lofty wisdom, his
wide-reaching<br>
benevolence, and his fervent appeals to their better
sentiments,<br>
enforced by the eloquence of which he was master, touched chords
in the<br>
popular heart which have continued to respond until this day.
Fragments<br>
of the speeches in which he addressed the council and the people
of the<br>
league are still remembered and repeated. The fact that the
league only<br>
carried out a part of the grand design which he had in view
is<br>
constantly affirmed. Yet the failure was not due to lack of
effort. In<br>
pursuance of his original purpose, when the league was firmly<br>
established, envoys were sent to other tribes to urge them to
join it,<br>
or at least to become allies. One of these embassies penetrated
to the<br>
distant Cherokees, the hereditary enemies of the Iroquois
nations. For<br>
some reason with which we are not acquainted, perhaps the
natural<br>
suspicion or vindictive pride of that powerful community, this
mission<br>
was a failure. Another, dispatched to the western Algonkins, had
better<br>
success. A strict alliance was formed with the far-spread
Ojibway<br>
tribes, and was maintained inviolate for at least two hundred
years,<br>
until at length the influence of the French, with the sympathy of
the<br>
Ojibways for the conquered Hurons, undid to some extent, though
not<br>
entirely, this portion of Hiawatha's work.</p>

<p>His conceptions were beyond his time, and beyond ours; but
their effect,<br>
within a limited sphere, was very great. For more than three
centuries<br>
the bond which he devised held together the Iroquois nations in
perfect<br>
amity. It proved, moreover, as he intended, elastic.&mdash;The
territory of<br>
the Iroquois, constantly extending as their united strength made
itself<br>
felt, became the "Great Asylum" of the Indian tribes. Of the
conquered<br>
Eries and Hurons, many hundreds were received and adopted among
their<br>
conquerors. The Tuscaroras, expelled by the English from North
Carolina,<br>
took refuge with the Iroquois, and became the sixth nation of
the<br>
League. From still further south, the Tuteloes and Saponies, of
Dakota<br>
stock, after many wars with the Iroquois, fled to them from their
other<br>
enemies, and found a cordial welcome. A chief still sits in the
council<br>
as a representative of the Tuteloes, though the tribe itself has
been<br>
swept away by disease, or absorbed in the larger nations.
Many<br>
fragments of tribes of Algonkin lineage&mdash;Delawares,
Nanticokes,<br>
Mohegans, Mississagas&mdash;sought the same hospitable protection,
which<br>
never failed them. Their descendants still reside on the
Canadian<br>
Reservation, which may well be styled an aboriginal "refuge of
nations,"<br>
affording a striking evidence in our own day of the persistent
force of<br>
a great idea, when embodied in practical shape by the energy of a
master<br>
mind.</p>

<p>The name by which their constitution or organic law is known
among them<br>
is <i>kay&aacute;nerenh</i>, to which the epitaph <i>kowa</i>,
"great," is<br>
frequently added. This word, <i>kay&aacute;nerenh</i>, is
sometimes rendered<br>
"law," or "league," but its proper meaning seems to be "peace."
It is<br>
used in this sense by the missionaries, in their translations of
the<br>
scriptures and the prayer-book. In such expressions as the
"Prince of<br>
Peace," "the author of peace," "give peace in our time," we
find<br>
<i>kay&aacute;nerenh</i> employed with this meaning. Its root is
<i>yaner</i>,<br>
signifying "noble," or "excellent," which yields, among many<br>
derivatives, <i>kay&aacute;nere</i>, "goodness," and
<i>kay&aacute;nerenh</i>,<br>
"peace," or "peacefulness." The national hymn of the confederacy,
sung<br>
whenever their "Condoling Council" meets, commences with a
verse<br>
referring to their league, which is literally rendered, "We come
to<br>
greet and thank the PEACE" (<i>kay&aacute;nerenh</i>). When the
list of their<br>
ancient chiefs, the fifty original councillors, is chanted in
the<br>
closing litany of the meeting, there is heard from time to time,
as the<br>
leaders of each clan are named, an outburst of praise, in the
words&mdash;</p>

<p>  "This was the roll of you&mdash;<br>
  You that combined in the work,<br>
  You that completed the work,<br>
  The GREAT PEACE." (<i>Kay&aacute;nerenh-kowa</i>.)</p>

<p>The regard of Englishmen for their Magna Charta and Bill of
Rights, and<br>
that of Americans for their national Constitution, seem weak
in<br>
comparison with the intense gratitude and reverence of the Five
Nations<br>
for the "Great Peace," which Hiawatha and his colleagues
established for<br>
them. Of the subsequent life of Hiawatha, and of his death, we
have no<br>
sure information. The records of the Iroquois are historical, and
not<br>
biographical. As Hiawatha had been made a chief among the
Caniengas, he<br>
doubtless continued to reside with that nation. A tradition,
which is in<br>
itself highly probable, represents him as devoting himself to
the<br>
congenial work of clearing away the obstructions in the streams
which<br>
intersect the country then inhabited by the confederated nations,
and<br>
which formed the chief means of communication between them. That
he<br>
thus, in some measure, anticipated the plans of De Witt Clinton
and his<br>
associates, on a smaller scale, but perhaps with a larger
statesmanship,<br>
we may be willing enough to believe. A wild legend recorded by
some<br>
writers, but not told of him by the Canadian Iroquois, and
apparently<br>
belonging to their ancient mythology, gives him an apotheosis,
and makes<br>
him ascend to heaven in a white canoe. It may be proper to dwell
for a<br>
moment on the singular complication of mistakes which has
converted this<br>
Indian reformer and statesman into a mythological personage.</p>

<p>When by the events of the Revolutionary war the original
confederacy was<br>
broken up, the larger portion of the people followed Brant to<br>
Canada. The refugees comprised nearly the whole of the Caniengas,
and<br>
the greater part of the Onondagas and Cayugas, with many members
of the<br>
other nations. In Canada their first proceeding was to
reestablish, as<br>
far as possible, their ancient league, with all its laws and<br>
ceremonies. The Onondagas had brought with them most of their
wampum<br>
records, and the Caniengas jealously preserved the memories of
the<br>
federation, in whose formation they had borne a leading part.
The<br>
history of the league continued to be the topic of their
orators<br>
whenever a new chief was installed into office. Thus the
remembrance of<br>
the facts has been preserved among them with much clearness
and<br>
precision, and with little admixture of mythological elements.
With the<br>
fragments of the tribes which remained on the southern side of
the Great<br>
Lakes the case was very different. A feeble pretense was made,
for a<br>
time, of keeping up the semblance of the old confederacy; but
except<br>
among the Senecas, who, of all the Five Nations, had had least to
do<br>
with the formation of the league, the ancient families which
had<br>
furnished the members of their senate, and were the conservators
of<br>
their history, had mostly fled to Canada or the West. The result
was<br>
that among the interminable stories with which the common people
beguile<br>
their winter nights, the traditions of Atotarho and Hiawatha
became<br>
intermingled with the legends of their mythology. An
accidental<br>
similarity, in the Onondaga dialect, between the name of Hiawatha
and<br>
that of one of their ancient divinities, led to a confusion
between the<br>
two, which has misled some investigators. This deity bears, in
the<br>
sonorous Canienga tongue, the name of Taronhiawagon, meaning "the
Holder<br>
of the Heavens." The Jesuit missionaries style him "the great god
of the<br>
Iroquois." Among the Onondagas of the present day, the name is
abridged<br>
to Taonhiawagi, or Tahiawagi. The confusion between this name and
that<br>
of Hiawatha (which, in another form, is pronounced Tahionwatha)
seems to<br>
have begun more than a century ago; for Pyrteus, the Moravian<br>
missionary, heard among the Iroquois (according to Heckewelder)
that the<br>
person who first proposed the league was an ancient Mohawk,
named<br>
Thannawege. Mr. J. V. H. Clarke, in his interesting History of
Onondaga,<br>
makes the name to have been originally Ta-oun-ya-wat-ha, and
describes<br>
the bearer as "the deity who presides over fisheries and<br>
hunting-grounds." He came down from heaven in a white canoe, and
after<br>
sundry adventures, which remind one of the labors of Hercules,
assumed<br>
the name of Hiawatha (signifying, we are told, "a very wise
man"), and<br>
dwelt for a time as an ordinary mortal among men, occupied in
works of<br>
benevolence. Finally, after founding the confederacy and
bestowing many<br>
prudent counsels upon the people, he returned to the skies by the
same<br>
conveyance in which he had descended. This legend, or, rather,
congeries<br>
of intermingled legends, was communicated by Clark to
Schoolcraft, when<br>
the latter was compiling his "Notes on the Iroquois." Mr.
Schoolcraft,<br>
pleased with the poetical cast of the story, and the euphonious
name,<br>
made confusion worse confounded by transferring the hero to a
distant<br>
region and identifying him with Manabozho, a fantastic divinity
of the<br>
Ojibways. Schoolcraft's volume, which he chose to entitle "The
Hiawatha<br>
Legends," has not in it a single fact or fiction relating either
to<br>
Hiawatha himself or to the Iroquois deity Taronhiawagon. Wild
Ojibway<br>
stories concerning Manabozho and his comrades form the staple of
its<br>
contents. But it is to this collection that we owe the charming
poem of<br>
Longfellow; and thus, by an extraordinary fortune, a grave
Iroquois<br>
lawgiver of the fifteenth century has become, in modern
literature, an<br>
Ojibway demigod, son of the West Wind, and companion of the
tricksy<br>
Paupukkeewis, the boastful Iagoo, and the strong Kwasind. If a
Chinese<br>
traveler, during the middle ages, inquiring into the history
and<br>
religion of the western nations, had confounded King Alfred with
King<br>
Arthur, and both with Odin, he would not have made a more
preposterous<br>
confusion of names and characters than that which has hitherto
disguised<br>
the genuine personality of the great Onondaga reformer.
[Footnote: This<br>
subject is further discussed in the Appendix, Note D.]</p>

<p>About the main events of his history, and about his character
and<br>
purposes, there can be no reasonable doubt. We have the wampum
belts<br>
which he handled, and whose simple hieroglyphics preserve the
memory of<br>
the public acts in which he took part. We have, also, in the
Iroquois<br>
"Book of Rites," which in the present volume is given in its
original<br>
form, a still more clear and convincing testimony to the
character both<br>
of the legislator and of the people for whom his institutions
were<br>
designed. This book, sometimes called the "Book of the
Condoling<br>
Council," might properly enough be styled an Iroquois Veda. It
comprises<br>
the speeches, songs, and other ceremonies, which, from the
earliest<br>
period of the confederacy, have composed the proceedings of
their<br>
council when a deceased chief is lamented and his successor is
installed<br>
in office. The fundamental laws of the league, a list of their
ancient<br>
towns, and the names of the chiefs who constituted their first
council,<br>
chanted in a kind of litany, are also comprised in the
collection. The<br>
contents, after being preserved in memory, like the Vedas, for
many<br>
generations, were written down by desire of the chiefs, when
their<br>
language was first reduced to writing; and the book is therefore
more<br>
than a century old. Its language, archaic when written, is now
partly<br>
obsolete, and is fully understood by only a few of the oldest
chiefs. It<br>
is a genuine Indian composition, and must be accepted as
disclosing the<br>
true character of its authors. The result is remarkable enough.
Instead<br>
of a race of rude and ferocious warriors, we find in this book a
kindly<br>
and affectionate people, full of sympathy for their friends in
distress,<br>
considerate to their women, tender to their children, anxious for
peace,<br>
and imbued with a profound reverence for their constitution and
its<br>
authors. We become conscious of the fact that the aspect in which
these<br>
Indians have presented themselves to the outside world has been
in a<br>
large measure deceptive and factitious. The ferocity, craft and
cruelty,<br>
which have been deemed their leading traits, have been merely
the<br>
natural accompaniments of wars of self-preservation, and no
more<br>
indicated their genuine character than the war-paint, plume and
tomahawk<br>
of the warrior displayed the customary guise in which he appeared
among<br>
his own people. The cruelties of war, when war is a struggle
for<br>
national existence, are common to all races. The persistent
desire for<br>
peace, pursued for centuries in federal unions, and in alliances
and<br>
treaties with other nations, has been manifested by few as
steadily as<br>
by the countrymen of Hiawatha. The sentiment of universal
brotherhood<br>
which directed their policy has never been so fully developed in
any<br>
branch of the Aryan race, unless it may be found incorporated in
the<br>
religious quietism of Buddha and his followers.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>THE BOOK OF RITES.</p>

<p>For a proper appreciation of this peculiar composition, some
further<br>
particulars respecting its origin and character will be needed.
During<br>
my earlier visits to the Reserve of the Six Nations, near
Brantford, I<br>
had heard of an Indian book which was used at their
"Condoling<br>
Councils," the most important of their many public gatherings.
But it<br>
was not until the month of September, 1879, that I had an
opportunity of<br>
seeing the work. At that time two copies of the book were brought
to me<br>
by the official holders, two of the principal chiefs of the<br>
confederacy. One of these was Chief John "Smoke" Johnson, who for
many<br>
years had held the high office of Speaker of the Great Council,
though,<br>
of late, yielding to age and infirmity, he has withdrawn from the
public<br>
performance of its duties. His second name is a rude rendering of
his<br>
truly poetical Indian appellation, Sakayen-gwaraton, or
"Disappearing<br>
Mist." It signifies properly, I was told, the haze which rises
from the<br>
ground in an autumn morning and vanishes as the day advances.
His<br>
English name, and, in part, his blood, Chief Johnson derives from
no<br>
less distinguished an ancestor than Sir William Johnson, who
played so<br>
notable a part in colonial history during the last century, and
who<br>
exercised, perhaps, a greater influence on the destiny of the
Iroquois<br>
than any other individual since the formation of their
confederacy. To<br>
him, indeed, may be ascribed the distinction, such as it is,
of<br>
destroying the work which Hiawatha and Dekanawidah had founded.
But for<br>
the influence over the Indians which he had acquired, and was
able to<br>
bequeath to others, it is probable that the Six Nations would
have<br>
remained neutral during the Revolutionary War, and the disruption
of<br>
their League would not have taken place. Yet there can be no
doubt that<br>
he was sincerely attached to them, and desired their good.
Unfortunately<br>
for them, they held, as was natural, only the second place in
his<br>
affections. He was, by adoption, an Iroquois chief, but his
first<br>
allegiance was due to his native country, to whose interests,
both in<br>
the war with France and in the separation which he foresaw
between<br>
England and her colonies, he did not hesitate to sacrifice the
welfare<br>
of his red brethren. Against his subtle arts and overmastering
energy<br>
the wisest of their statesmen, worthy successors of the great
founders<br>
of their constitution, strove in vain, on each occasion, to
maintain<br>
that neutrality which was evidently the true policy of their<br>
people. [Footnote: For the confirmation of these statements see
the<br>
excellent biographies of Sir William Johnson and Joseph Brant,
by<br>
Wm. L. Stone, <i>passim</i>.]</p>

<p>Sakayengwaraton is not an elected chief, nor does he bear one
of the<br>
hereditary titles of the Great Council, in which he holds so<br>
distinguished a station. Indeed, his office is one unknown to
the<br>
ancient constitution of the Kanonsionni. It is the creation of
the<br>
British Government, to which he owes, with the willing consent of
his<br>
own people, his rank and position in the Council. The
Provincial<br>
administrators saw the need of a native official who should be,
like the<br>
Speaker of the English House of Commons, the mouthpiece of the
Council,<br>
and the intermediary between it and the representative of the
Crown. The<br>
grandson of Sir William Johnson was known as a brave warrior, a
capable<br>
leader, and an eloquent speaker. In the war of 1812, at the early
age of<br>
twenty, he had succeeded an elder brother in the command of the
Indian<br>
contingent, and had led his dusky followers with so much skill
and<br>
intrepidity as to elicit high praise from the English commander.
His<br>
eloquence was noted, even among a race of orators. I can well
believe<br>
what I have heard of its effects, as even in his old age, when
an<br>
occasion has for a moment aroused his spirit, I have not known
whether<br>
most to admire the nobleness and force of his sentiments and
reasoning,<br>
or the grace and flowing ease with which he delivered the
stately<br>
periods of his sonorous language. He has been a worthy successor
of the<br>
distinguished statesmen, Garagontieh, Garangula, Decanasora,
Canasatego,<br>
Logan, and others, who in former years guided the destinies of
his<br>
people. He is considered to have a better knowledge of the
traditions<br>
and ancient usages of the Six Nations than any other member of
the<br>
tribes, and is the only man now living who can tell the meaning
of every<br>
word of the "Book of Rites."</p>

<p>The other chief to whom I have referred is the Onondaga
Councillor who<br>
is known to the whites as John Buck, but who bears in council the
name<br>
of Skanawati ("Beyond the River"), one of the fifty titular names
which<br>
have descended from the time of Hiawatha. He is the official
keeper of<br>
the "wampum records" of the confederacy, an important trust,
which, to<br>
his knowledge, has been in his family for at least four
generations. His<br>
rank, his character, and his eloquence make him now, virtually,
the<br>
Iroquois premier&mdash;an office which among the Six Nations, as among
the<br>
Athenians of old and the English of modern days, is both unknown
to the<br>
constitution and essential to its working. His knowledge of the
legends<br>
and customs of his people is only inferior to that of the more
aged<br>
Speaker of the Council.</p>

<p>The account which Chief J. S. Johnson gave me of the book may
be briefly<br>
told. The English missionaries reduced the Canienga language to
writing<br>
in the early part of the last century. The Jesuit fathers,
indeed, had<br>
learned and written the language&mdash;which they styled the
Iroquois&mdash;fifty<br>
years before; but it does not appear that they had instructed any
of the<br>
Indians in the art of writing it, as their successors in the
Eastern<br>
Province have since done. The English missionaries took pains to
do<br>
this. The liturgy of their church was printed in the Mohawk
tongue, at<br>
New York, as early as the year 1714. [Footnote: This date is
given in<br>
the preface to the Mohawk Prayer Book of 1787. This first version
of the<br>
liturgy was printed under the direction of the Rev. Wm. Andrews,
the<br>
missionary of the "New England Society."] By the middle of the
century<br>
there were many members of the tribe who could write in the
well-devised<br>
orthography of the missionaries&mdash;an orthography which anticipated
in<br>
most points the well known "Pickering alphabet," now generally'
employed<br>
in writing the Indian languages of North America. The chiefs of
the<br>
Great Council, at once conservative and quick to learn, saw
the<br>
advantages which would accrue from preserving, by this novel
method, the<br>
forms of their most important public duty&mdash;that of creating
new<br>
chiefs&mdash;and the traditions connected with their own body. They
caused<br>
the ceremonies, speeches and songs, which together made up
the<br>
proceedings of the Council when it met for the two purposes,
always<br>
combined, of condolence and induction, to be written down in the
words<br>
in which they had been preserved in memory for many generations.
A<br>
Canienga chief, named David, a friend of Brant, is said to
have<br>
accomplished the work. In Stone's Life of Sir William Johnson,
mention<br>
is made of a Mohawk chief, "David of Schoharie," who in May,
1757, led a<br>
troop of Indians from his town to join the forces under Sir
William, in<br>
his expedition to Crown Point, to repel the French invaders.
[Footnote:<br>
<i>Life of Sir William Johnson</i>, Vol. II. p. 29] Brant appears
to<br>
have been in this expedition. [Footnote: Ibid., p. 174] It is
highly<br>
probable that in Chief David of Schoharie we have the compiler,
or<br>
rather the scribe, of this "Iroquois Veda."</p>

<p>The copy of this book which Chief J. S. Johnson possessed was
made by<br>
himself under the following circumstances: During the prevalence
of the<br>
Asiatic cholera, in 1832, the tribes on the Reserve suffered<br>
severely. Chief Johnson, then a young man and not yet a leader in
the<br>
Great Council, was active in attending on the sick. He was called
to<br>
visit an aged chief, who was not expected to live. The old
chief<br>
informed him that he had this book in his possession, and advised
him,<br>
as he was one of the few who could write the language, to make a
copy of<br>
it, lest by any accident the original should be lost. Johnson
followed<br>
this advice, and copied the book on loose sheets of paper, from
which he<br>
afterwards transcribed it into a small unbound book, resembling
a<br>
schoolboy's copy-book. He states that the original book
contained,<br>
besides the ceremonies of the Condoling Council, an addition by a
later<br>
hand, comprising some account of the more recent history of the
Six<br>
Nations, and particularly of their removal from New York to
Canada. This<br>
portion of it he unfortunately omitted to copy, and shortly
afterwards<br>
the book itself was destroyed, when the house of the old chief
was<br>
accidentally burned.</p>

<p>The other copy which I transcribed was held by Chief John
Buck, in his<br>
official capacity of record-keeper. It is written in a
somewhat<br>
different orthography. The syllables are separated, as in the
usual<br>
style of Indian hymnbooks, and some of the words, particularly
the<br>
proper names, show by their forms that the person who copied the
book<br>
was an Onondaga. The copy was evidently not made from that of
Chief<br>
Johnson, as it supplies some omissions in that copy. On the other
hand,<br>
it omits some matters, and, in particular, nearly all the
adjurations<br>
and descriptive epithets which form the closing litany
accompanying the<br>
list of hereditary councillors. The copy appears, from a
memorandum<br>
written in it, to have been made by one "John Green," who, it
seems, was<br>
formerly a pupil of the Mohawk Institute at Brantford. It bears
the<br>
date of November, 1874. I could not learn where he found his
original.</p>

<p>The translation has been made from the dictation of Chief J.
S. Johnson,<br>
who explained the meaning of the archaic words in the modern
Canienga<br>
speech. This was interpreted in English by his son, Chief
George<br>
H. M. Johnson, and afterwards more fully elucidated by my
esteemed<br>
friend, the Rev. Isaac Bearfoot, who kindly came from his parish,
at<br>
Point Edward (near Sarnia), to the Reserve, to assist me in
this<br>
work. Mr. Bearfoot is an Onondaga by birth, but a Canienga by
adoption,<br>
and has a thorough knowledge of the Canienga language. He
prepared the<br>
revised edition of the hymnbook in that language, which is now
used on<br>
the Reserve. He is a good English scholar, and, having been
educated in<br>
Toronto for the ministry, has filled for some years, with
much<br>
acceptance, the office of pastor to a white congregation of the
Church<br>
of England. I am greatly indebted to him for his judicious
assistance,<br>
and, finally, for a complete revision of the entire version of
the<br>
Canienga portion of the book.</p>

<p>To my friend Chief George Johnson I am under still greater<br>
obligations. Mr. Johnson, as has been stated, is the son of
Chief<br>
J. S. Johnson, and is himself a high chief of the Canienga
nation. He<br>
bears in the Great Council the name of Teyonhehkwen (otherwise
spelt<br>
Deyonheghgonh), meaning "Double Life," one of the titular names
which<br>
were borne by the companions of Hiawatha and Atotarho in the
first<br>
council. He succeeded in this title, according to the rules of
the<br>
confederacy, his maternal uncle, on the nomination of his mother,
as the<br>
chief matron of the family. Mr. Johnson is an educated gentleman.
In<br>
early life he was a pupil of the English missionaries. He now
holds the<br>
position of Government Interpreter for the Six Nations, and is,
in fact,<br>
the chief executive officer of the Canadian government on the<br>
Reserve. His duties have several times brought him into collision
with<br>
the white ruffians who formerly infested the Reserve, and from
whom he<br>
has on two occasions suffered severe injuries, endangering his
life. His<br>
courage and firmness, however, have been finally successful in
subduing<br>
this mischief, and the Reserve is now as secure and as free
from<br>
disorder as any part of Canada. To Chief, George Johnson's
assistance<br>
and encouragement I owe most of the information contained in
these<br>
pages, and I am glad to have an opportunity of paying him this
tribute<br>
of respect and gratitude.</p>

<p>The second or supplementary part of the Book, which is in the
Onondaga<br>
dialect, was found on the, small Reservation in the State of New
York,<br>
near Syracuse, where a feeble remnant of the great Onondaga
nation still<br>
cling to the home of their forefathers. In October, 1875, during
my<br>
first visit to Onondaga Castle, as this Reservation is called,
I<br>
obtained from the intelligent interpreter, Daniel La Fort&mdash;a son
of the<br>
distinguished chief Abram La Fort (Dehatkatons), who is
commemorated in<br>
Clark's "Onondaga"&mdash;a list of the original councillors in the
Onondaga<br>
dialect, and also a copy, in the same dialect, of the "Condoling
Song,"<br>
which I had heard sung on the Canadian Reserve, and which I
afterwards<br>
found in the Canienga Book of Rites. He read them to me from a
small<br>
manuscript book, in which, as I then supposed, he had noted them
for his<br>
own convenience. When I afterwards discovered the Canienga book,
it<br>
occurred to me that I might have been mistaken on this point, and
that<br>
the manuscript from which he read was possibly a copy of the Book
of<br>
Rites in the Onondaga dialect. To clear up this point, I again
visited<br>
Onondaga Castle, in September, 1880. I then found, to my
great<br>
gratification, that his book was not a copy, but a valuable
addition, or<br>
rather an essential complement, to the Canienga book. The
last-named<br>
book comprises the speeches which are addressed by the
representatives<br>
of the three elder nations to the younger members of the
League,<br>
whenever a chief who belonged to the latter is lamented. The
Onondaga<br>
book, on the other hand, gives us the exhortations which are
addressed<br>
by the younger nations to the elder when a chief of the latter
is<br>
mourned. The circumstance to which it owes its preservation on
the<br>
Onondaga Reserve is easily explained. Of late years, since
the<br>
chieftainships among the New York Senecas and Tuscaroras have
been made<br>
purely elective offices, the only body of Indians in that State
among<br>
whom the original system of mingled descent and appointment has
been<br>
retained is the remnant of the intensely conservative Onondagas.
Among<br>
these, in spite of missionary efforts continued for two
centuries,<br>
paganism still lingers, and chiefs are still "raised up" as
nearly as<br>
possible after the ancient fashion. When a chief dies, the
members of<br>
his family or clan select another, who is presented to the
national<br>
council for induction. The ceremonies of condolence, with which
the<br>
proceedings commence, are modeled after the primitive form. As
the<br>
Onondagas were one of the elder nations, the addresses of
condolence<br>
must proceed from a younger brother. Fortunately for this
purpose, a few<br>
Oneidas reside on the Reserve, among whom is a single chief, by
name<br>
Abram Hill. To him is committed the duty of representing the
"younger<br>
brothers" on this occasion, and with it the charge of the
wampum<br>
strings, which are produced occasionally as the ceremony
proceeds, each<br>
string representing one section or topic of the condoling
address.</p>

<p>La Fort said that he had copied his book from a manuscript in
his<br>
father's handwriting. This manuscript, unfortunately, was lost,
and he<br>
could not say whether his rather had first written it down from
memory,<br>
or had merely transcribed it from an earlier composition. However
this<br>
may have been, the substance of the composition undoubtedly dates
from a<br>
period preceding the disruption of the confederacy. The
language,<br>
indeed, so far as can be judged from the very irregular
orthography, is<br>
modern. If, as there is reason to suppose, the composition is
ancient,<br>
it has evidently undergone a "revision" at the hands of the
later<br>
copyists. In former times, as we know from the Jesuit
vocabularies, the<br>
sound of <i>r</i> existed in the Onondaga dialect. Since their
day this<br>
sound has disappeared from it entirely. In La Fort's manuscript
the<br>
letter frequently occurred, but always, as his pronunciation
showed,<br>
either as a diacritical sign following the vowel <i>a</i>, to
give to<br>
that vowel the sound of <i>a</i> in "far," or else as
representing<br>
itself this vowel sound. Thus the syllable which should properly
be<br>
written <i>sa</i> was written by La Fort either <i>sar</i> or
<i>sr</i>.<br>
But, though the language is modern, the speeches themselves, as I
am<br>
assured by Chief John Buck, are precisely those which are still
in use<br>
among his people in Canada, and which are believed to have
been<br>
preserved in memory from the days of their forefathers.
[Footnote: The<br>
disappearance of a vocal element from a language is a phenomenon
with<br>
which etymologists are familiar. The loss of the Greek digamma is
a<br>
well-known instance. The harsh guttural, resembling the German
ch.<br>
which formerly existed in the English language, has vanished from
it,<br>
leaving its traces in the uncouth orthography of such words
as<br>
<i>plough</i>, <i>high</i>, <i>though</i>, and the like. Within
the past<br>
three centuries the sound of <i>I</i> has been lost from many
words,<br>
such as <i>walk</i>, <i>talk</i>, <i>balm</i> and <i>calm</i>.
The sound<br>
of <i>r</i> is disappearing from a large portion of the language.
In<br>
ordinary speech, <i>arm</i> rhymes with <i>calm</i>,
<i>morning</i> with<br>
<i>fanning</i>, <i>higher</i> with <i>Sophia</i>. Modern French,
as is<br>
well known, has attained its present euphony through the
disappearance<br>
of consonantal elements from many words in which they formerly
existed.]</p>

<p>The translation of La Fort's book was procured from him and
another<br>
educated member of his tribe; but there was not time to obtain
all the<br>
elucidations needed to ensure precise verbal accuracy
throughout.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>THE CONDOLING COUNCIL.&mdash;CLANS AND CLASSES.</p>

<p>The name usually given to the Book of Rites, or rather to its
contents,<br>
is, in the Canienga dialect, <i>Okayondonghsera Yondennase</i>
(or in<br>
the French missionary orthography, <i>Okaiontonhstra
Iontennase</i>),<br>
which may be rendered "Ancient Rites of the Condoling
Council."<br>
[Footnote: <i>Okaionlonhsera</i> is a substantive derived
from<br>
<i>akaion</i>, old, or ancient. The termination <i>sera</i> gives
it an<br>
abstract sense. "The antiquities," or rather "the ancientnesses,"
is the<br>
nearest literal rendering which our language allows,
<i>Iontennase</i><br>
is a verbal form, derived from <i>kitenre</i> (in Bruyas,<br>
<i>gentenron</i>), to pity, or sympathize with. It may be
rendered "they<br>
who sympathize," or "the condolers." Both, words, however, have
acquired<br>
a special meaning in their application to these ceremonies.]
Among the<br>
many councils, civil and religious, tribal and federal, in which
the<br>
public spirit and social temper of the Iroquois found their
most<br>
congenial and most popular mode of display, the Yondennase,
the<br>
Condoling (or Mourning) Council, held the highest rank. It was,
in a<br>
certain way, typical of the whole, and comprised the elements of
all the<br>
other councils. In its earlier form this council was not peculiar
to the<br>
Iroquois. We know, from the Jesuit reports, that it was the
custom of<br>
the Hurons to hold a public lamentation for the death of a chief,
and at<br>
the same time to appoint another who should take his place and
assume<br>
his name. But that which among the Hurons was merely a tribal
custom<br>
became, in the Iroquois form of government, an important
institution,<br>
essential to the maintenance of their state. By the ordinances of
their<br>
League, it was required that the number of their federal senate
should<br>
be maintained undiminished. On the death of one of its members,
it was<br>
the duty of the nation to which he belonged to notify the other
nations<br>
of the event, and of the time and place at which he would be
lamented<br>
and his successor installed. The notice was given in the usual
manner,<br>
by official messengers, who bore for credentials certain strings
of<br>
wampum, appropriate to the occasion. The place of meeting was
commonly<br>
the chief town of the nation which had suffered the loss. In this
nation<br>
a family council, under the presidency, and subject, indeed (as
has been<br>
shown), to the controlling decision, of the chief matron of the
deceased<br>
senator's kindred&mdash;usually his mother, if she survived him&mdash;was
in the<br>
meantime convened to select his successor. The selection must
be<br>
approved both by his clan and by his nation; but as their
sentiments<br>
were generally known beforehand, this approval was rarely<br>
withheld. Indeed, the mischief resulting from an unsuitable
choice was<br>
always likely to be slight; for both the national council and
the<br>
federal senate had the right of deposing any member who was
found<br>
unqualified for the office.</p>

<p>At the appointed day the chiefs of the other nations
approached the<br>
place of meeting. A multitude of their people, men and women,
usually<br>
accompanied them, prepared to take part both in the exhibitions
of grief<br>
and in the festivities which always followed the installation of
the new<br>
councillor. The approaching chiefs halted when they reached the
border<br>
of the "opening," or cleared space surrounding the town. Here
took place<br>
the "preliminary ceremony," styled in the Book of Rites,<br>
"<i>Deyughnyonkwarakda</i>," a word which means simply "at the
edge of<br>
the woods." At this point a fire was kindled, a pipe was lighted
and<br>
passed around with much formality, and an address of welcome was
made by<br>
the principal chief of the inviting nation. The topics of this
address<br>
comprised a singular mixture of congratulation and condolence,
and seem<br>
to have been prescribed forms, which had come down from
immemorial<br>
antiquity, as appropriate to the occasion.</p>

<p>The guests were then formally conducted&mdash;"led by the hand," as
the Book<br>
recites&mdash;to the Council House of the town. They seem, anciently
at<br>
least, to have advanced in the order of their clans. The towns
belonging<br>
to the Wolf clan were first enumerated&mdash;probably as the chiefs
belonging<br>
to them took their places&mdash;then the towns of the Tortoise clan
(or<br>
double clan, as it is styled), and finally those of the Bear
clan. In<br>
all, twenty-three towns are named. Five of them are expressly
stated to<br>
have been "added lately." The residue are supposed to be the
names of<br>
the towns in which the people of the Five Nations resided at the
time<br>
when the confederacy was formed, though this point is uncertain.
That<br>
few of these can now be identified, is what would naturally
be<br>
expected. It is well known that the Indians had the custom of
removing<br>
their towns from time to time, at intervals varying from ten to
twenty<br>
years, as the fuel in their neighborhood became exhausted, and as
the<br>
diminished crops under their primitive mode of agriculture showed
the<br>
need of fresher soil. Only those villages would be permanent
whose<br>
localities offered some special advantages, as fortresses,
fishing<br>
places, or harbors. [Footnote: See Appendix, note E.]</p>

<p>This list of towns has another peculiarity which arrests
the<br>
attention. It apparently comprises all the towns of the League,
but<br>
these are divided among only three clans, those of the Wolf,
the<br>
Tortoise and the Bear. The other clans of the confederacy are not
once<br>
named in the book. Yet there are indications which show that when
the<br>
list of chiefs which concludes the book was written, at a date
long<br>
after this list of towns was first recited, other clans existed
in three<br>
of the nations. This is an important point, which merits
further<br>
consideration. Those who have read the admirable account of the
"League<br>
of the Iroquois," by Morgan, and his philosophic work on
"Ancient<br>
Society," are aware that he has brought out and elucidated with
much<br>
clearness and force the nature and results of the remarkable clan
system<br>
which prevails among the North American Indians. It is not
universal, as<br>
it does not seem to be known among the widely scattered bands of
the<br>
Crees and the Athapascans, or among the Indians of Oregon.
[Footnote:<br>
See <i>Ancient Society</i>, pp. 167, 175, 177.] It was found,
however,<br>
among the great majority of tribes in the region north of Mexico
and<br>
east of the Rocky Mountains, and was sufficiently alike in all
to<br>
indicate a common origin. Mr. Morgan finds this origin in a
kinship,<br>
real or supposed, among the members of each clan. He considers
the clan,<br>
or gens, and not the single family, to be the natural unit of
primitive<br>
society. It is, in his view, a stage through which the human race
passes<br>
in its progress from the savage state to civilization. It is
difficult,<br>
however, to reconcile this theory with the fact that among some
races,<br>
as for example, the Polynesian and Feejeean, which are in
precisely the<br>
same stage of social advancement as the North American Indians,
this<br>
institution is unknown; and even among the Indians, as has been
said, it<br>
is not everywhere found. There are many indications which seem to
show<br>
that the system is merely an artificial arrangement, instituted
for<br>
social convenience. It is natural, in the sense that the desire
for<br>
association is natural to man. The sentiment is one which
manifests<br>
itself alike in all stages of society. The guilds of the middle
ages,<br>
the masonic and other secret brotherhoods, religious
organizations,<br>
trade unions, clubs, and even political parties, are all
manifestations<br>
of this associative instinct. The Indian clan was simply a
brotherhood,<br>
an aggregate of persons united by a common tie, sometimes of
origin,<br>
sometimes merely of locality. These brotherhoods were not
permanent, but<br>
were constantly undergoing changes, forming, dividing,
coalescing,<br>
vanishing. The names of many of them show their recent origin.
The<br>
Chicasas have a "Spanish clan." [Footnote: <i>Ancient
Society</i>,<br>
p. 163.] The Shawnees had a "Horse clan." [Footnote: Ibid, p.
168.] The<br>
Iroquois, of Eastern Canada, made up of fragments of all the
Five<br>
Nations, had an "Onondaga clan," and an "Oneida clan."
[Footnote:<br>
Rotisennakete, and Rotinenhiotronon. See J. A. Cuoq, <i>Lexique
de la<br>
Langut Iroquoise</i>, p. 154. The proper meaning of these names
will be<br>
hereafter shown.] It is a curious fact that, as Mr. Morgan
states, "the<br>
Iroquois claim to have originated a division of the people into
tribes<br>
[clans or gentes] as a means of creating new relationships, to
bind the<br>
people more firmly together. It is further asserted by them that
they<br>
forced or introduced this social organization among the
Cherokees, the<br>
Chippeways (Massasaugas) and several other Indian nations, with
whom, in<br>
ancient times, they were in constant intercourse." "The fact," he
adds,<br>
"that this division of the people of the same nation into tribes
does<br>
not prevail generally among our Indian races, favors the
assertions of<br>
the Iroquois." [Footnote: <i>League of the Iroquois</i>, p.
91.]<br>
Further inquiry and reflection led this distinguished
investigator to<br>
take a totally different view, and to go to what may be deemed
the<br>
opposite extreme of regarding this clan system as an essential
stage in<br>
the growth of human society.</p>

<p>There can be no question that an idea of kinship pervaded the
clan<br>
system, and was its ruling element. It may, in many instances,
have been<br>
purely imaginary and, so to speak, figurative, like the
"brotherhood" of<br>
our secret associations; but it was none the less efficacious
and<br>
binding. As the members of a clan regarded themselves as brothers
and<br>
sisters, marriages among them were not allowed. This led, of
course, to<br>
constant intermarriages between members of the different clans of
which<br>
a nation was composed, thus binding the whole nation together.
What the<br>
founders of the Iroquois League did was to extend this system of
social<br>
alliances through the entire confederacy. The Wolf clansman of
the<br>
Caniengas was deemed a brother of the Wolf clansman of the
Senecas,<br>
though originally there may have been no special connection
between<br>
them. It was a tie apparently artificial in its origin, as much
so as<br>
the tie which binds a freemason of Berlin to a freemason of
New<br>
Orleans. But it came to have all the strength of a tie of<br>
kindred. Mr. Morgan has well pointed out the wisdom shown by
the<br>
Iroquois founders, in availing themselves of this powerful
element of<br>
strength in the formation of their federal constitution.
[Footnote:<br>
<i>League of the Iroquois</i>, p. 82, <i>et seq</i>.] Their
government,<br>
though politically a league of nations, was socially a
combination of<br>
clans. In this way Hiawatha and Dekanawidah may be deemed to have
given<br>
to the system of clan-ship an extension and a force which it had
not<br>
previously possessed; and it is by no means unlikely that this
example<br>
may, as the Iroquois assert, have acted upon neighboring nations,
and<br>
led to a gradual increase in the number and influence of
these<br>
brotherhoods.</p>

<p>But here a discrepancy presents itself in the Iroquois system,
which has<br>
perplexed all who have written on the subject. Two of the Six
Nations,<br>
the Caniengas and Oneidas, had only three clans, the Wolf, the
Tortoise<br>
and the Bear; while the others had, or at least have, each eight
or<br>
nine, and these variously styled in the different nations. The
three<br>
which have been named are, indeed, found in all; but besides
these<br>
three, the Onondagas have five, Deer, Eel, Beaver, Ball and
Snipe. The<br>
Cayugas and Senecas have also eight clans, which are similar to
those of<br>
the Onondagas, except that among the Cayugas the Ball clan is
replaced<br>
by the Hawk, and among the Senecas both Ball and Eel disappear,
and are<br>
replaced by Hawk and Heron. The Tuscaroras have likewise eight
clans,<br>
but among these are neither the Hawk, the Heron or the Ball. In
lieu of<br>
them the Wolf clan is divided into two, the Gray Wolf and the
Yellow<br>
Wolf, and the Tortoise furnishes two, the Great Tortoise and the
Little<br>
Tortoise; [Footnote: It is deserving of notice that this division
of the<br>
Tortoise clan seems to exist in a nascent form among the
Onondagas. The<br>
name of this clan is Hahnowa, which is the general word for
tortoise;<br>
but the clan is divided into two septs or subdivisions, the<br>
Hanyatengona, or Great Tortoise, and the Nikahnowaksa, or
Little<br>
Tortoise, which together are held to constitute but one clan. How
or why<br>
the distinction is kept up I did not learn. In the Book of Rites
the<br>
Tortoise clan is also spoken of in the dual number&mdash;"the two
clans of<br>
the Tortoise." It is probable, therefore, that this partial
subdivision<br>
extended throughout the original Five Nations, and became
complete among<br>
the Tuscaroras.] the Bear, the Beaver, the Eel and the Snipe
remain, as<br>
among the Onondagas, Cayugas and Senecas.</p>

<p>We are naturally led to ask how it happens that only three
clans are<br>
found among the Caniengas and Oneidas, while the other nations
have<br>
eight. Mr. Morgan was inclined to think that the other five once
existed<br>
among the two former nations, and had become extinct.
[Footnote:<br>
<i>League of the Iroquois</i>, p. 81. Ancient Society, p. 92.]
The<br>
native annalists of those nations, however, affirm that no more
than<br>
three clans ever existed among them. This assertion is now
confirmed,<br>
indirectly but strongly, by the testimony of the Book of Rites,
which<br>
seems to show that only three clans were recognized in the
whole<br>
confederacy when the League was formed. All the towns of the
united<br>
nations were distributed among the three primary clans of the
Wolf, the<br>
Tortoise and the Bear. If the other clans existed, it was
probably<br>
merely as septs or divisions of these three. [Footnote: "The
Turtle<br>
family, or the Anowara, was the most noble of the whole League;
next<br>
came the Ochquari, or clan of the Bear, and the Oquacho, or that
of the<br>
Wolf. These three were so prominent that Zeisberger hardly
recognizes<br>
the others."&mdash;<i>De Sckweinitz's Life of Zeisberger</i>,<br>
p.79. Zeisberger had been adopted into the nation of the
Onondagas and<br>
the clan of the Tortoise. His knowledge of the laws and usages of
the<br>
Kanonsionni was acquired chiefly in that nation. Charlevoix makes
the<br>
Bear the leading clan of the Iroquois. It would seem that the
relative<br>
rank of the clans varied in the different nations. The chiefs of
the<br>
Wolf clan come first in the list of Oneida councillors.] It is
more<br>
likely, however, that these additional clans were of later
creation or<br>
introduction. Their origin, as well as their restriction to the
three<br>
western nations, may be easily explained. The successive
conquests<br>
achieved by the Iroquois in the early part of the seventeenth
century<br>
had the result of incorporating with their people great numbers
of<br>
Hurons, Eries, Attiwandaronks, Andastes, and other captives
belonging to<br>
tribes of the same stock, speaking similar dialects, and having
usages<br>
closely resembling those of their captors. Of these captives,
some were<br>
directly adopted into the Iroquois families and clans; but a
larger<br>
number remained for a time in separate towns, retaining their
own<br>
usages. They were regarded, however, and they regarded
themselves, as<br>
Iroquois. Constant intercourse and frequent intermarriages
soon<br>
abolished all distinctions of national origin. But the
distinction of<br>
clan-ship would remain. The Hurons (or, at least, the
Tionontates, or<br>
Tobacco Nation) had clans of the Deer and the Hawk, and they had
a Snake<br>
clan bearing a name (<i>yagonirunon</i>) not unlike the name of
the<br>
Onondaga Eel clan (<i>ogontena</i>), and evidently derived from
the same<br>
root. The other conquered nations had doubtless some peculiar
clans; for<br>
these brotherhoods, as has been shown, were constantly in process
of<br>
formation and change among the Indian tribes. Almost all the
captives<br>
were incorporated with the three western nations of the League,
to whom<br>
the conquered tribes were mostly nearer than to the Caniengas
and<br>
Oneidas. The origin of the additional clans among the Onondagas,
Cayugas<br>
and Senecas is thus readily understood.</p>

<p>One fact, important in its connection with the structure of
the federal<br>
council, remains to be noted, and if possible, elucidated.
The<br>
councillors of each nation were divided into classes, whose part
in the<br>
deliberations of the councils bore a certain resemblance to that
held by<br>
the committees of our legislatures. The operation of this system
cannot<br>
be better described than in the words of Morgan: "The founders of
the<br>
confederacy, seeking to obviate, as far as possible, altercation
in<br>
council, and to facilitate their progress to unanimity, divided
the<br>
sachems of each nation into classes, usually of two or three
each, as<br>
will be seen by referring to the table of sachemships. No sachem
was<br>
permitted to express an opinion in council, until he had agreed
with the<br>
other sachem or sachems of his class upon the opinion to be
expressed,<br>
and had received an appointment to act as speaker for the class.
Thus<br>
the eight Seneca sachems, being in four classes, could have but
four<br>
opinions, the ten Cayuga sachems but four. In this manner each
class was<br>
brought to unanimity within itself. A cross-consultation was then
held<br>
between the four sachems who represented the four classes; and
when they<br>
had agreed, they appointed one of their number to express
their<br>
resulting opinion, which was the answer of their nation. The
several<br>
nations having, by this ingenious method, become of 'one
mind'<br>
separately, it only remained to compare their several opinions to
arrive<br>
at the final sentiment of all the sachems of the League. This
was<br>
effected by a conference between the individual representatives
of the<br>
several nations; and when they had arrived at unanimity, the
answer of<br>
the League was determined." [Footnote: <i>League of the
Iroquois</i>,<br>
p, 112.]</p>

<p>A careful consideration of the facts, in the light cast upon
them by the<br>
evidence of the "Book of Rites" and the testimony of the
Canadian<br>
Iroquois, leaves no doubt that these classes were originally
identical<br>
with the clans. Among the Caniengas and Oneidas this identity
still<br>
exists. Each of these nations received nine representatives in
the<br>
federal council. These were&mdash;and still are&mdash;divided into three
each<br>
composed of three members, and each class representing a clan. In
the<br>
Canienga tribe the members of the first class are all of the
Tortoise<br>
clan, those of the second class are of the Wolf clan, and those
of the<br>
third class of the Bear clan. Among the Oneidas, the councillors
of the<br>
first class belong to the Wolf clan, those of the second class to
the<br>
Tortoise clan, and those of the third class to the Bear clan.
Such was<br>
the information which Mr. Morgan received from his Seneca
friends, and<br>
such I found to be the fact among the Iroquois now in Canada.
When we<br>
come to the other nations we find a wholly different state of
things. No<br>
correspondence now exists between the classes and the clans. The
Cayugas<br>
have now, as has been shown, eight clans; but of these only
six,<br>
according to the list given by Morgan, and only five in that
furnished<br>
to me by the Canadian chiefs, are represented in the council.
These are<br>
distributed in three classes, which do not correspond to the
clans. In<br>
Morgan's list the first class has five members, the first of
whom<br>
belongs to the Deer clan, the second to that of the Heron, the
third and<br>
fourth to that of the Bear, and the fifth to that of the
Tortoise. In my<br>
list this class also comprises five chiefs, of whom the first
two<br>
(identical in name with the first two of Morgan) belong to the
Deer<br>
clan, while the third (who bears the same name as Mr. Morgan's
third)<br>
is of the Bear clan. In the "Book of Rites" the first Cayuga
class<br>
comprises only two chiefs, but their clans (which were supposed
to be<br>
known to the hearers) are not indicated. The fourteen
Onondaga<br>
councillors are divided into five classes, according to Morgan,
and also<br>
in the modern Canadian list. The "Book of Rites" seems to give
only<br>
four, but none of these&mdash;according to the evidence of the
Canadian<br>
chiefs&mdash;correspond with the modern clans; and the same
councillor, in<br>
lists received from different sources, is found to belong to
different<br>
classes and different clans. Thus the distinguished title of
Skanawati<br>
is borne, in Mr. Morgan's list, by a chief of the fifth class and
of<br>
the third clan. In the list obtained by me at Onondaga Castle
this chief<br>
is of the fourth class and of the Ball clan. The great Seneca
chief<br>
Kanyadariyo is, in Mr. Morgan's list, a member of the Tortoise
clan,<br>
while among the Canadian Senecas he belongs to the Wolf clan. In
short,<br>
it is evident that the introduction of the new clans among the
western<br>
nations has thrown this part of their constitutional system
into<br>
confusion. The probability is that when the confederacy was
established<br>
only three clans, Bear, Wolf and Tortoise, existed among the
Iroquois,<br>
as only three clans, Bear, Wolf and Turkey, existed in recent
times<br>
among their Algonkin neighbors, the Lenni Lenape, or Delawares.
Thus the<br>
classes of their Council grew spontaneously out of their clan
system, as<br>
the senators of each clan would naturally consult together.
Afterwards<br>
new clans arose; but it seems probable that when the list of
councillors<br>
comprised in the "Book of Rites" was written&mdash;that is, about the
middle<br>
of the last century&mdash;the correspondence of classes and clans was
still<br>
maintained. The number of both was increased in the western
tribes, but<br>
each class was still composed of chiefs of the same clan. The
written<br>
book fixed the classes to a certain extent, but the clans to
which their<br>
members belonged continued to vary, under the influence of
political and<br>
social changes. If, at the death of a councillor, no member of
his clan<br>
was found qualified to succeed him, a successor would be elected
from<br>
another clan which was deemed to be in some way connected with
him. I<br>
was assured by the Onondaga chiefs of the New York Reservation
that this<br>
was their rule at present; and it is quite sufficient to account
for the<br>
departure, in the western nations, from the ancient system. It
is<br>
evident that after the nations and clans were rent to fragments
by the<br>
dissensions and emigration caused by the American Revolution,
these<br>
changes would, for a time, be necessarily frequent. And thus it
happens<br>
that chiefs are found in the duplicate confederacies which after
this<br>
disruption were established in Canada and New York, who bear the
same<br>
titular designation, but differ both in the clans and in the
classes to<br>
which they belong.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>THE CONDOLENCE AND THE INSTALLATION.</p>

<p>With the arrival at the Council House the "opening ceremony"
is<br>
concluded. In the house the members of the Council were seated in
the<br>
usual array, on opposite sides of the house. On one side were the
three<br>
elder nations, the Caniengas, Onondagas, and Senecas, and on the
other<br>
the younger, who were deemed, and styled in Council, the
offspring of<br>
the former. These younger members, originally two in number, the
Oneidas<br>
and Cayugas, had afterwards an important accession in the
Tuscarora<br>
nation; and in later years several smaller tribes, or, as they
were<br>
styled, additional braces of the Extended House, were<br>
received;&mdash;Tuteloes, Nanticokes, Delawares and others. In the
Onondaga<br>
portion of the book the younger tribes speak as "we three
brothers."<br>
The earliest of the later accessions seems to have taken place
about the<br>
year 1753, when the Tuteloes and Nanticokes were admitted.
[Footnote:<br>
<i>N. Y. Hist. Col.</i>, Vol. 6, p. 811. Stone's <i>Life of Sir
William<br>
Johnson</i>, p. 414.] These circumstances afford additional
evidence<br>
that the Book was originally written prior to that date and
subsequent<br>
to the year 1714, when the Tuscaroras were received into the
League.</p>

<p>If the deceased chief belonged to one of the three older
nations, the<br>
duty of conducting the condoling ceremony which followed was
performed<br>
by the younger nations, who mourned for him as for a father or
an<br>
uncle. If he were a chief of one of the younger nations, the
others<br>
lamented him as a son or a nephew. The mourning nations selected
as<br>
their representative a high chief, usually a distinguished
orator,<br>
familiar with the usages and laws of the League, to conduct
these<br>
ceremonies. The lamentations followed a prescribed routine,
each<br>
successive topic of condolence being indicated by a string of
wampum,<br>
which, by the arrangement of its beads, recalled the words to the
memory<br>
of the officiating chief. In the "Book of Rites" we have these
addresses<br>
of condolence in a twofold form. The Canienga book gives us the
form<br>
used by the elder nations; and the Onondaga supplement adds the
form<br>
employed by the younger brothers. The former is more ancient,
and<br>
apparently more dignified and formal. The speaker addresses the
mourners<br>
as his children (<i>konyennetaghkwen</i>, "my offspring,") and
recites<br>
each commonplace of condolence in a curt and perfunctory style.
He wipes<br>
away their tears that they may see clearly; he opens their ears
that<br>
they may hear readily. He removes from their throats the
obstruction<br>
with which their grief is choking them, so that they may ease
their<br>
burdened minds by speaking freely to their friends. And finally,
as the<br>
loss of their lamented chief may have occurred in war&mdash;and at all
events<br>
many of their friends have thus perished&mdash;he cleans the mats on
which<br>
they are sitting from the figurative bloodstains, so that they
may for a<br>
time cease to be reminded of their losses, and may regain their
former<br>
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>The condolence of the younger brothers, expressed in the
Onondaga book,<br>
is more expansive and more sympathetic. Though apparently
disfigured<br>
and mutilated by repeated transcriptions, it bears marks of
having been<br>
originally the composition of a superior mind. All such topics
of<br>
consolation as would occur to a speaker ignorant or regardless of
a<br>
future life are skillfully presented, and the whole address is
imbued<br>
with a sentiment of cordial tenderness and affection. Those who
have<br>
been accustomed to regard the Indians as a cold-hearted people
will find<br>
it difficult to reconcile that view of their character with the
contrary<br>
evidence afforded by this genuine expression of their feelings,
and,<br>
indeed, by the whole tenor of the Book.</p>

<p>This address concludes with the emphatic words, "I have
finished; now<br>
point me the man;" or, as the words were paraphrased by the
interpreter,<br>
"Now show me the warrior who is to be the new chief." The
candidate for<br>
senatorial honors, who is to take the place and name of the
deceased<br>
councillor, is then brought forward by his nation. His admission
by the<br>
assembled Council, at this stage of the proceedings, is a matter
of<br>
course; for his nation had taken care to ascertain, before the
meeting,<br>
that the object of their choice would be acceptable to the
councillors<br>
of the other nations. The ceremony of induction consisted in the
formal<br>
bestowal of the new name by which he was henceforth to be known.
A<br>
chief placed himself on each side of the candidate, and, grasping
his<br>
arms, marched him to and fro in the Council house, between the
lines of<br>
the assembled senators. As they walked they proclaimed his new
name and<br>
office, and recited, in a measured chant, the duties to which he
was now<br>
called, the audience responding at every pause with the usual
chorus of<br>
assent.</p>

<p>When this ceremony was finished, and the new councillor had
taken his<br>
proper seat among the nobles of his nation, the wampum belts,
which<br>
comprised the historical records of the federation, were
produced, and<br>
the officiating chief proceeded to explain them, one by one, to
the<br>
assemblage. This was called "reading the archives." In this way
a<br>
knowledge of the events signified by the wampum was fastened,
by<br>
repeated iteration, in the minds of the listeners. Those who
doubt<br>
whether events which occurred four centuries ago can be
remembered as<br>
clearly and minutely as they are now recited, will probably have
their<br>
doubts removed when they consider the necessary operation of
this<br>
custom. The orator's narrative is repeated in the presence of
many<br>
auditors who have often heard it before, and who would be prompt
to<br>
remark and to correct any departure from the well-known
history.</p>

<p>This narrative is not recorded in the Book of Rites. At the
time when<br>
that was written, the annals of the confederacy were doubtless
supposed<br>
to be sufficiently preserved by the wampum records. The speeches
and<br>
ceremonies which followed, and which were of equal, if not
greater<br>
importance, had no such evidences to recall them. From this
statement,<br>
however, the "hymn" should be excepted; to each line of it,
except the<br>
last, a wampum string was devoted. With this exception, all was
left to<br>
the memory of the orator. The Homeric poems, the hymns of the
Vedas, the<br>
Kalewala, the Polynesian genealogies, and many other examples,
show the<br>
exactness with which a composition that interests a whole nation
may be<br>
handed down; but it is not surprising that when the chiefs became
aware<br>
of the superior advantages of a written record, they should have
had<br>
recourse to it. We need not doubt that Chief David of Schoharie,
or<br>
whoever else was the scribe appointed to this duty, has
faithfully<br>
preserved the substance, and, for the most part, the very words,
of the<br>
speeches and chants which he had often heard under such
impressive<br>
circumstances.</p>

<p>The hymn, or <i>karenna</i>, deserves a special notice. In
every<br>
important council of the Iroquois a song or chant is considered a
proper<br>
and almost essential part of the proceedings. Such official songs
are<br>
mentioned in many reports of treaty councils held with them by
the<br>
French and English authorities. In this greatest of all councils
the<br>
song must, of course, have a distinguished place. It follows
immediately<br>
upon the address of greeting and condolence, and is, in fact,
regarded<br>
as the completion of it, and the introduction to the equally
important<br>
ceremony which is to follow, viz., the repetition of the ancient
laws of<br>
the confederacy. This particular hymn is of great antiquity. Some
of the<br>
chiefs expressed to me the opinion that it was composed by
Dekana-widah<br>
or Hiawatha. Its tenor, however, as well as that of the whole
book,<br>
shows that it belongs to a later period. The ceremonies of the
council<br>
were doubtless prescribed by the founders of the League; but
the<br>
speeches of the Book, and this hymn, all refer to the League as
the work<br>
of a past age. The speakers appeal to the wisdom of their
forefathers<br>
(literally, their grandsires), and lament the degeneracy of the
later<br>
times. They expressly declare that those who established the
"great<br>
peace" were in their graves, and had taken their work with them
and<br>
placed it as a pillow under them. This is the language of men
who<br>
remembered the founders, and to whom the burial of the last of
them was<br>
a comparatively recent event. If the league was formed, as
seems<br>
probable, about the year 1450, the speeches and hymn, in their
present<br>
form, may reasonably be referred to the early part of the next
century.<br>
There is reason to believe that the formation of the confederacy
was<br>
followed by wars with the Hurons and Algonkin tribes, in which,
as<br>
usual, many changes of fortune took place. If the Hurons, as has
been<br>
shown, were expelled from their abode on the northern shore of
the<br>
St. Lawrence, the Mohegans, on the other hand, inflicted some
serious<br>
blows upon the eastern nations of the confederacy. [Footnote: See
the<br>
Jesuit <i>Relation</i> for 1660, p. 6.] The Delawares were not
conquered<br>
and reduced to subjection without a long and sanguinary struggle.
In a<br>
Condoling Council we might expect that the tone of feeling would
be<br>
lugubrious; but the sense of loss and of danger is too marked in
all the<br>
speeches of the Canienga Book to be merely a formal utterance. It
does<br>
not appear in those of the Onondaga Book, which is seemingly of
later<br>
composition.</p>

<p>The "karenna," or chant of the Condoling Council, may be
styled the<br>
National Hymn of the Iroquois. A comparison between it and
other<br>
national hymns, whose chief characteristics are
self-glorification and<br>
defiance, might afford room for some instructive inferences. This
hymn,<br>
it should be remarked, brief as it is, is regarded by the Indians
as a<br>
collection of songs. Each line, in fact, is, in their view, a
song by<br>
itself, and is brought to mind by its own special wampum string.
In<br>
singing, each line is twice repeated, and is introduced and
followed by<br>
many long-drawn repetitions of the exclamation <i>aihaigh</i> (or
rather<br>
<i>haihaih</i>) which is rendered "hail!" and from which the
hymn<br>
derives its designation. In the first line the speaker salutes
the<br>
"Peace," or the league, whose blessings they enjoy. In the next
he<br>
greets the kindred of the deceased chief, who are the special
objects of<br>
the public sympathy. Then he salutes the <i>oyenkondonh</i>, a
term<br>
which has been rendered "warriors." This rendering, however, may
have a<br>
misleading effect. The word has nothing to do with war, unless in
the<br>
sense that every grown man in an Indian community is supposed to
be a<br>
soldier. Except in this hymn, the word in question is now
disused. An<br>
elderly chief assured me that he had sung it for years without
knowing<br>
its precise meaning. Some of his fellow-councillors were
better<br>
informed. The word is apparently derived from <i>ankwe</i>, man,
which<br>
in the Onondaga dialect becomes <i>yenkwe</i>. It comprises all
the men<br>
(the "manhood" or mankind) of the nation&mdash;as, in the following
verse,<br>
the word <i>wakonnyh</i>, which is also obsolete, signifies
the<br>
"womanhood," or all the women of the people with whom the
singer<br>
condoles. In the next line he invokes the laws which their
forefathers<br>
established; and he concludes by calling upon his hearers to
listen to<br>
the wisdom of their forefathers, which he is about to recite. As
a<br>
whole, the hymn may be described as an expression of reverence
for the<br>
laws and for the dead, and of sympathy with the living. Such is
the<br>
"national anthem,"&mdash;the Marseillaise,&mdash;of the ferocious
Iroquois.</p>

<p>The regard for women which is apparent in this hymn, and in
other<br>
passages of the Book, is deserving of notice. The common notion
that<br>
women among the Indians were treated as inferiors, and made
"beasts of<br>
burden," is unfounded so far as the Iroquois are concerned, and
among<br>
all other tribes of which I have any knowledge. With them, as
with<br>
civilized nations, the work of the community and the cares of the
family<br>
are fairly divided. Among the Iroquois the hunting and fishing,
the<br>
house-building and canoe-making, fell to the men. The women
cooked, made<br>
the dresses, scratched the ground with their light hoes, planted
and<br>
gathered the crops, and took care of the children. The household
goods<br>
belonged to the woman. On her death, her relatives, and not her
husband,<br>
claimed them. The children were also hers; they belonged to her
clan,<br>
and in case of a separation they went with her. She was really
the head<br>
of the household; and in this capacity her right, when she
chanced to be<br>
the oldest matron of a noble family, to select the successor of
a<br>
deceased chief of that family, was recognized by the highest law
of the<br>
confederacy. That this rank and position were greatly prized is
shown by<br>
a remarkable passage in the Jesuit Relations. A Canienga
matron,<br>
becoming a Christian, left her country, with two of her children,
to<br>
enjoy greater freedom in her devotions among the French. The act,
writes<br>
the missionary, so offended her family that, in a public meeting
of the<br>
town, "they degraded her from the rank of the nobility, and took
from<br>
her the title of Oyander, that is, honorable
(<i>considerable</i>)&mdash;a<br>
title which they esteem highly, and which she had inherited from
her<br>
ancestors, and deserved by her good judgment, her prudence, and
her<br>
excellent conduct; and at the same time they installed another in
her<br>
place." [Footnote: <i>Relation</i> of 1671, p. 6. The word<br>
<i>oyander</i> in modern pronunciation becomes <i>oyaner</i>. It
is<br>
derived from the root <i>yaner</i>, noble, and is the feminine
form of<br>
the word <i>royaner</i>, lord, or nobleman,&mdash;the title applied to
the<br>
members of the federal council.]</p>

<p>The complete equality of the sexes in social estimation and
influence is<br>
apparent in all the narratives of the early missionaries, who
were the<br>
best possible judges on this point. Casual observers have been
misled<br>
by the absence of those artificial expressions of courtesy which
have<br>
descended to us from the time of chivalry, and which, however
gracious<br>
and pleasing to witness, are, after all, merely signs of
condescension<br>
and protection from the strong to the weak. The Iroquois does not
give<br>
up his seat to a woman, or yield her precedence on leaving a
room; but<br>
he secures her in the possession of her property, he recognizes
her<br>
right to the children she has borne, and he submits to her
decision the<br>
choice of his future rulers.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>THE LAWS OF THE LEAGUE.</p>

<p>It is the custom of the officiating orator, while the chant is
going on,<br>
to walk to and fro in the council-house. When the hymn is
finished, he<br>
breaks out into a passionate invocation to their forefathers, and
a<br>
lament over the degeneracy of the times. This, as the French<br>
missionaries inform us, was a favorite topic of Indian<br>
speakers. [Footnote: See the <i>Relation</i> of 1659, p. 57:
"C'est la<br>
plainte ordinaire des Capitaines [of the Hurons] que tout se va
perdant,<br>
a faute de garder les formes et coustoumes de leurs ancestres."]
Among<br>
the Iroquois, who could look back to an era of genuine statesmen
and<br>
heroes, the authors of their constitution, this complaint must
have had<br>
a peculiar force and sincerity. After this appeal to the founders
of<br>
their state, there naturally followed an address to the Council
and the<br>
people, reciting "all the rules they decided on, which they
thought<br>
would strengthen the house." By "the house" was meant, of course,
the<br>
house of many hearths, to which they likened their confederacy.
The<br>
"rules" or laws which follow require some explanation, that their
full<br>
value may be understood.</p>

<p>The first law prescribes that when a chief dies his office
shall not<br>
perish with him. This is expressed, in their metaphorical style,
by an<br>
injunction that the "horns," or insignia of office, shall not be
buried<br>
with the deceased chief, but shall be taken off at his death, to
be<br>
transferred to his successor. This rule is laid down in the most
urgent<br>
and impressive terms. "We should perhaps all perish if his office
is<br>
buried with him in his grave." This systematic transmission of
official<br>
rank was, in fact, the vital principle of their government. It
was in<br>
this system that their federal union differed from the frequent
and<br>
transitory confederacies common among the Indian tribes. In
general,<br>
among nearly all the tribes, the rank of a chief was personal. It
was<br>
gained by the character and achievements of the individual, and
it died<br>
with him. Hence their government and policy, so far as they can
be said<br>
to have had any, were always uncertain and fluctuating. No
person<br>
understood the Indian usages better than Zeisberger. His
biographer has<br>
well described the difference which existed in this respect
between the<br>
Iroquois and their neighbors. "The Algonkins," he writes, "knew
nothing<br>
of regular government. They had no system of polity; there was no
unity<br>
of action among them. The affairs even of a single tribe were
managed in<br>
the loosest manner." After briefly, but accurately, delineating
the<br>
Iroquois system of councils, he adds: "Thus they became both a
political<br>
and a military power among the aborigines; the influence of their
league<br>
was felt everywhere, and their conquests extended in every
direction."<br>
[Footnote: De Schweinitz: <i>Life of Zeisberger, p. 39.] The
principle<br>
that "the chief dies but the office survives,"&mdash;the regular
transmission<br>
of rank, title and authority, by a method partly hereditary and
partly<br>
elective,&mdash;was the principle on which the life and strength of
the<br>
Iroquois constitution depended.</i></p>

<p><i>Next followed a provision of hardly less importance. The
wars among the<br>
Indian tribes arise almost always from individual murders. The
killing<br>
of a tribesman by the members of another community concerns his
whole<br>
people. If satisfaction is not promptly made, war follows, as a
matter<br>
of course. [Footnote: Relation, of 1636, p. 119. "C'est de la<br>
que naissent les guerres, et c'est un sujet plus que suffisant
de<br>
prendre les armes contre quelque Village quand il refuse de
satisfaire<br>
par les presents ordonnez, pour celuy qui vous aurait tue
quelq'un des<br>
vostres."&mdash;Brebeuf, on the Hurons.] The founders of the
Iroquois<br>
commonwealth decreed that wars for this cause should not be
allowed to<br>
rise between any of their cantons. On this point a special charge
was<br>
given to the members of the Great Council. They were enjoined (in
the<br>
figurative language employed throughout the Book) not to allow
the<br>
murder to be discussed in a national assembly, where the
exasperation of<br>
the young men might lead to mischief, but to reserve it for their
own<br>
consideration; and they were required as soon as possible to bury
all<br>
animosities that might arise from it. The figure employed is
impressive.<br>
They were to uproot a huge pine-tree&mdash;the well-known emblem of
their<br>
League&mdash;disclosing a deep cavity, below which an underground
stream<br>
would be swiftly flowing. Into this current they were to cast the
cause<br>
of trouble, and then, replacing the tree, hide the mischief
forever from<br>
their people.</i></p>

<p>How strictly in spirit these injunctions were followed, and
with what<br>
good effect, their whole history shows. A notable instance of
the<br>
readiness and ingenuity of their statesmen in finding the means
of<br>
public reconciliation in such cases is given in the Jesuit
narrative. On<br>
the 24th of July, 1657, a great council was held at Onondaga to
consider<br>
three matters, all of special import. First in order was the
necessity<br>
of appeasing a threatened quarrel between two of the leading
nations,<br>
the Senecas and the Caniengas, caused by a misadventure in which
a<br>
Seneca "captain" had been killed by some warriors of the
eastern<br>
nation. Next in importance was the reception of a large party
of<br>
Frenchmen, headed by Father Francis le Mercier, the Superior of
the<br>
Jesuit missionaries in Canada, who had come to form a settlement
among<br>
the Iroquois. And, finally, they had to prepare the plan and the
means<br>
for an expedition against some hostile tribes. Before the meeting
of<br>
the Council the Frenchmen had paid a formal visit to the
Seneca<br>
delegates, whom they found "filling the air with songs of
mourning" for<br>
their slaughtered chief, and had manifested their sympathy by a
present,<br>
"to alleviate the grief" of the mourners. This incident seems to
have<br>
suggested to the assembled councillors a method of effecting&mdash;or
at<br>
least of announcing&mdash;the desired accommodation, and of paying at
the<br>
same time a happy compliment to their reverend visitors. By
common<br>
consent the affair was referred to the arbitrament of the
Father<br>
Superior, by whom the difference was promptly settled. [Footnote:
On<br>
tim* ce grand conseil le 24 du mois de Juillet, ou toutes les
Nations<br>
remisent entre les mains d'Achiendase qui est nostre P&egrave;re
Superieur le<br>
diffrend* Centre les Sonnonto&uuml;eronnons et les Agnieronnons,
qui fait<br>
bien et termin&eacute;.&mdash;<i>Relation of</i> 1657, p. 16.] It was
not necessary<br>
for the politic senators to inform their gratified visitors that
the<br>
performance in which they thus took part was merely a formality
which<br>
ratified, or rather proclaimed, a foregone conclusion. The<br>
reconciliation which was prescribed by their constitution had<br>
undoubtedly been arranged by previous conferences, after their
custom in<br>
such matters, before the meeting of the Council. [Footnote: For
a<br>
curious instance of the manner in which questions to be
apparently<br>
decided by a Council were previously settled between the parties,
see<br>
the <i>Life of Zeisberger</i>, p. 190: "Gietterowane was the
speaker on<br>
one side, Zeisberger on the other. These two consulted
together<br>
privately,&mdash;Zeisberger unfolding the import of the strings [of
wampum<br>
which he had brought as ambassador] and Gietterowane committing
to<br>
memory what he said."] So effective was this provision of
their<br>
constitution that for more than three centuries this main cause
of<br>
Indian wars was rendered innocuous, and the "Great Peace"
remained<br>
undisturbed. This proud averment of their annalists, confirmed as
it is<br>
for more than half the period by the evidence of their white
neighbors,<br>
cannot reasonably be questioned. What nation or confederacy
of<br>
civilized Europe can show an exemption from domestic strife for
so long<br>
a term?</p>

<p>The third rule or ordinance which the founders enacted "to
strengthen<br>
the house" is of a remarkable character. It relates to the
mortuary<br>
usages of the people; and when these are understood, the
great<br>
importance of this law becomes apparent. Among the Indians of
the<br>
Huron-Iroquois family the ordinary mourning for the dead
became<br>
exaggerated into customs of the most extravagant character,
exhausting<br>
the time and strength of the warriors, and devouring their
substance.<br>
The French missionaries have left us an account of these singular
usages<br>
among the Hurons, some of which excited their respect, and others
their<br>
astonishment. "Our savages," they wrote, "are in no way savage
as<br>
regards the duties which nature herself requires us to render to
the<br>
dead. You would say that their efforts, their toils and their
commerce<br>
had no other end than to amass the means of honoring the
departed. They<br>
have nothing too precious for this object. To this they devote
their<br>
robes of skins, their hatchets and wampum, in such profusion that
you<br>
would fancy they made nothing of them; and yet these are the
riches of<br>
their country. Often in midwinter you will see them going almost
naked,<br>
while they have at home, laid up in store, good and handsome
robes,<br>
which they keep in reverence for the dead. This is their point
of<br>
honor. In this, above all, they seek to show themselves
magnificent."<br>
[Footnote: Brebeuf, <i>Relation of</i> 1636, p. 128.]</p>

<p>During the three days that preceded the burial of the dead, or
the<br>
removal of his remains to the scaffold, the wails, groans and<br>
lamentations of the relatives and neighbors resounded in the
cabin where<br>
he lay. All the stored riches were brought forth and lavished in
gifts<br>
"to comfort the mourners." The mourning did not end with the
burial; in<br>
fact, it may be said to have then only begun. The "great
mourning," as<br>
the missionaries term it, lasted for six days longer, during
which the<br>
mourners lay, face downward, upon their mats, and enveloped in
their<br>
robes, speechless, or replying only by an ejaculation to those
who<br>
addressed them. During this period they had no fire in the house,
even<br>
in winter; they ate their food cold, and left the cabin only at
night,<br>
and as secretly as possible. The "lesser mourning" lasted for a
year,<br>
during which they refrained from oiling their hair, attended
public<br>
festivals rarely, and only (in the case of women) when their
mothers<br>
ordered, and were forbidden to marry again.</p>

<p>This, however, was not all. Once in twelve years was held a
great<br>
ceremony of re-interment,&mdash;a solemn "feast of the dead," as it
was<br>
called. Until the day of this feast arrived, funeral rites in
honor of<br>
the departed were repeated from time to time, and feasts were
held, at<br>
which, as the expression was, their names were revived, while
presents<br>
were distributed, as at the time of their death. The great Feast
of the<br>
Dead, however, was the most important of all their ceremonies.
The<br>
bodies of all who had died in the nation during the preceding
twelve<br>
years were then exhumed, or removed from the scaffolds on which
they had<br>
been laid, and the festering corpses or cleansed bones were all
interred<br>
together in a vast pit lined with robes of beaver skins, the
most<br>
precious of all their furs. Wampum, copper implements,
earthenware, the<br>
most valued of their possessions, were cast into the pit, which
was then<br>
solemnly closed with earth. While the ceremony was going on,
rich<br>
presents of all descriptions, the accumulations of the past
twelve<br>
years, were distributed by the relatives of the deceased among
the<br>
people. In this distribution, strange to say, valuable fur robes
were<br>
frequently cut and torn to pieces, so as to be rendered
worthless. A<br>
lavish display and reckless destruction of wealth were deemed
honors due<br>
to the shades of the departed. [Footnote: See the <i>Relation</i>
for<br>
1636, p. 131. A most vivid and graphic description of these<br>
extraordinary ceremonies is given in Parkman's admirable work,
<i>The<br>
Jesuits in North America</i>, Chapter 7.]</p>

<p>The Attiwandaronks, or Neutrals, who were the nearest
neighbors of the<br>
Iroquois, were still more extravagant in their demonstrations
of<br>
affection for their lost friends. They, too, had their feasts of
the<br>
dead, at regular intervals. In the meantime the bodies were kept
in<br>
their houses as long as possible&mdash;"until the stench became
intolerable."<br>
Then, when this proximity could no longer be borne, the remains
were<br>
left for a period to decay on a scaffold in the open air. After a
time<br>
the remaining flesh was removed from the bones, which were
arranged on<br>
the sides of their cabins, in full view of the inmates, until the
great<br>
day of general interment. With these mournful objects before
their<br>
eyes, renewing constantly the sense of their loss, the women of
the<br>
household were excited to frequent outbursts of grief, expressed
in<br>
wailing chants. [Footnote: "Cet object qu'ils ont devant les
yeux, leur<br>
renouvellant continuellement le resentiment de leurs pertes, leur
fait<br>
ordinairement letter des cris, et faire des lamentations tout
&agrave; fait<br>
lugubres, le tout en chanson. Mais cela ne se fait que par
les<br>
femmes."&mdash;<i>Relation</i> of 1641, p. 73.]</p>

<p>That the Iroquois in ancient times had funeral customs similar
to those<br>
of their sister nations, and not less revolting, cannot be
doubted. How<br>
these shocking and pernicious usages were abolished at one swoop
is<br>
shown by the brief passage in the Book of Rites now under<br>
discussion. The injunctions are laconic, but full of meaning.
When a<br>
death occurs, the people are told, "this shall be done." A
delegation of<br>
persons, officially appointed for the purpose, shall repair to
the<br>
dwelling of the deceased, bearing in a pouch some strands of
mourning<br>
wampum. The leader, holding these strands, and standing by the
hearth,<br>
shall address, in the name of the whole people, a few words of
comfort<br>
to the mourners. And then "they shall be comforted," and shall go
on<br>
with their usual duties. To this simple ceremony&mdash;supplemented,
in the<br>
case of a high chief, by the rites of the "Condoling
Council,"&mdash;the<br>
preposterous funeral usages, which pervaded the lives and wasted
the<br>
wealth of the other nations of this stock, were reduced, by the
wisdom<br>
of the Iroquois legislators.</p>

<p>In considering these remarkable laws, it becomes evident that
the work<br>
which Hiawatha and Dekanawidah accomplished was really a
Great<br>
Reformation, not merely political, but also social and religious.
They<br>
desired not only to establish peace among the nations, but also
to<br>
abolish or modify such usages and beliefs as in their opinion
were<br>
injurious to their people. It is deserving of notice that a
divinity<br>
unknown, at least in name, to the Hurons, received special
reverence<br>
among the Iroquois. The chief characters of the Huron pantheon
were a<br>
female deity, Ataensic, a sort of Hecate, whom they sometimes
identified<br>
with the moon, and her grandson, Juskeha, who was sometimes
regarded as<br>
the sun, and as a benevolent spirit, but most commonly in their
stories<br>
appears as a fantastic and capricious goblin, with no moral
attributes<br>
whatever. In the Iroquois mythology these deities are replaced by
a<br>
personage of a much higher character. Taronhiawagon, the Holder
of the<br>
Heavens, was with them the Master of Life. He declared his will
to them<br>
in dreams, and in like manner disclosed future events,
particularly such<br>
as were important to the public welfare. He was, in fact, the
national<br>
god of the Iroquois. It was he who guided their fathers in their
early<br>
wanderings, when they were seeking for a place of abode. He
visited them<br>
from time to time, in person, to protect them from their enemies
and to<br>
instruct them in useful arts.</p>

<p>It is possible that the Iroquois Taronhiawagon may have been
originally<br>
the same as the Huron Juskeha. Some eminent authorities on
Indian<br>
mythology are inclined to this opinion. On the other hand, the
earlier<br>
Jesuit missionaries give no hint of such identity, and the
Tuscarora<br>
historian, Cusick, seems to distinguish between these divine<br>
personages. But whether we accept this view or seek for any
other<br>
origin, there seems reason to suppose that the more exalted
conception<br>
of this deity, who is certainly, in character and attributes, one
of the<br>
noblest creations of the North American mythologies, dates from
the era<br>
of the confederacy, when he became more especially the chief
divinity<br>
and protector of the Kanonsionni. [Footnote: See for
Taronhiawagon the<br>

<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p>HISTORICAL TRADITIONS.</p>

<p>After the declaration of the laws of the League, there follows
a passage<br>
of great historical importance. The speaker recites the names of
the<br>
chiefs who represented the Five Nations in the conference by
which the<br>
work of devising their laws and establishing their government
was<br>
accomplished. The native name of the confederacy is here for the
first<br>
time mentioned. In the guttural and rather irregular orthography
of the<br>
Book it is spelt <i>Kanonghsyonny</i>. The Roman Catholic
missionaries,<br>
neglecting the aspirate, which in the Iroquois pronunciation
appears and<br>
disappears as capriciously as in the spoken dialects of the south
of<br>
England, write the word Kanonsionni. It is usually rendered
by<br>
interpreters the "Long House," but this is not precisely its<br>
meaning. The ordinary word for "long house" is <i>kanonses</i>
or<br>
<i>kanonsis</i>,&mdash;the termination <i>es</i> or <i>is</i> being
the<br>
adjective suffix which signifies <i>long</i>. <i>Kanonsionni</i>
is a<br>
compound word, formed of <i>kanonsa</i>, <i>house</i>, and
<i>ionni</i>,<br>
extended, or drawn out. The confederacy was compared to a
dwelling which<br>
was extended by additions made to the end, in the manner in which
their<br>
bark-built houses were lengthened,&mdash;sometimes to an extent
exceeding two<br>
hundred feet. When the number of families inhabiting these
long<br>
dwellings was increased by marriage or adoption, and a new hearth
was<br>
required, the end-wall,&mdash;if this term may be applied to the
slight frame<br>
of poles and bark which closed the house,&mdash;was removed, an
addition of<br>
the required size was made to the edifice, and the closing wall
was<br>
restored. Such was the figure by which the founders of the
confederacy<br>
represented their political structure, a figure which was in
itself a<br>
description and an invitation. It declared that the united
nations were<br>
not distinct tribes, associated by a temporary league, but one
great<br>
family, clustered for convenience about separate hearths in a
common<br>
dwelling; and it proclaimed their readiness to receive new
members into<br>
the general household. [Footnote: The people of the confederacy
were<br>
known as <i>Rotinonsionni</i>, "They of the Extended House." In
the<br>
Seneca dialect this was altered and abridged to Hotinonsonni, the
n<br>
having the French nasal sound. This word is written by Mr.
Morgan,<br>
"Hodenosaunee."]</p>

<p>The names of the six great chiefs who, as representatives of
their<br>
several nations, formed the confederacy, are in this narrative
linked<br>
together in a manner which declares their political kinship. The
first<br>
rulers or heads of the combined households were the Canienga
Dekanawidah<br>
with his "joint-ruler" and political son, the Oneida Otatsehte
(or<br>
Odadsheghte), whose union with Dekanawidah was the commencement
of the<br>
League. Next follows Otatsehte's uncle (and Dekanawidah's
brother), the<br>
Onondaga Wathadodarho (Atotarho), who is accompanied by his son,
the<br>
Cayuga Akahenyonh. The uncle of the Cayuga representative, the
Seneca<br>
chief Kanadariyu, and his cousin, Shadekaronyes, represent the
two<br>
sections into which the great Seneca nation was divided. The name
of<br>
Hiawatha does not appear in this enumeration. According to the
uniform<br>
tradition of the Five Nations, he was not merely present in
the<br>
convention, but was the leading spirit in its deliberations. But
he did<br>
not officially represent any nation. By birth a high chief of
the<br>
Onondagas, he had been but newly adopted among the Caniengas.
Each of<br>
these nations had entrusted its interests to its own most
influential<br>
chief. But the respect with which Hiawatha was regarded is
indicated, as<br>
has been already remarked, by his place in the list of fifty<br>
councillors, with whose names the Book concludes. Though so
recently<br>
received among the haughty Caniengas, whose proud and jealous
temper is<br>
often noticed by the missionaries and other early observers, his
name is<br>
placed second in the list of their representatives,
immediately<br>
following that of Tekarihoken, the chief who stood highest in
titular<br>
rank among the nobles of the Kanonsionni, and whose lineage was
perhaps<br>
derived from the leader of their primitive migrations.</p>

<p>The tradition runs that when the political frame of their
confederacy<br>
had been arranged by the members of this convention, and the
number of<br>
senators who should represent each nation in the federal council
had<br>
been determined, the six delegates, with Hiawatha and some
other<br>
advisers, went through all the nations, selecting&mdash;doubtless with
the<br>
aid of a national council in each case&mdash;the chiefs who were
to<br>
constitute the first council. In designating these,&mdash;or
rather,<br>
probably, in the ceremonies of their installation,&mdash;it is said
that some<br>
peculiar prerogative was conceded to the Onondagas,&mdash;that is,
to<br>
Atotarho and his attendant chiefs. It was probably given as a
mark of<br>
respect, rather than as conferring any real authority; but from
this<br>
circumstance the Onondagas were afterwards known in the council
by the<br>
title of "the nominators." The word is, in the Canienga
dialect,<br>
<i>Rotisennakehte</i>,&mdash;in Onondaga, <i>Hotisennakehte</i>. It
means<br>
literally, "the name-carriers,"&mdash;as if, said one of my
informants, they<br>
bore a parcel of names in a bag slung upon the back.</p>

<p>Each of the other nations had also its peculiar name in the
Council,<br>
distinct from the mere local designation by which it was
commonly<br>
called. Thus the Caniengas had for their "Council name" the
term<br>
<i>Tehadirihoken</i>. This is the plural form of the name of
their<br>
leading chief, Tekarihoken. Opinions differ much among the
Indians as<br>
to the meaning of this name. Cusick, the Tuscarora historian,
defines it<br>
"a speech divided," and apparently refers it to the division of
the<br>
Iroquois language into dialects. Chief George Johnson, the
interpreter,<br>
rendered it "two statements together," or "two pieces of news
together."<br>
Another native informant thought it meant "one word in two
divisions,"<br>
while a third defined it as meaning "between two words." The
root-word<br>
of the name is the Canienga <i>orihwa</i>, or <i>karihwa</i>,
(properly<br>
<i>karihoa</i>), which is defined "thing, affair, speech,
news."<br>
[Footnote: See Bruyas, <i>sub voce Gorihoa</i>. Mr. Morgan
(<i>League of<br>
the Iroquois</i>, p. 97), who derived his information from the
Senecas,<br>
says that the name "was a term of respect, and signifies
'neutral,' or,<br>
as it may be rendered, the shield." He adds, "its origin is lost
in<br>
obscurity."] It also apparently means office; thus we have
the<br>
derivatives <i>garihont</i>, "to give some charge of duty to some
one,"<br>
and <i>atrihont</i>, "to be an officer, or captain." The name is
in the<br>
peculiar dual or rather duplicative form which is indicated by
the<br>
prefix <i>te</i> and the affix <i>ken</i> or <i>ke</i>. It may
possibly,<br>
therefore, mean "holding two offices," and would thus be
specially<br>
applicable to the great Canienga noble, who, unlike most of his
order,<br>
was both a civil ruler and a war-chief. But whether he gave his
name to<br>
his people, or received it from them, is uncertain. In other
instances<br>
the Council name of a nation appears to have been applied in
the<br>
singular number to the leading chief of the nation. Thus the
head-chief<br>
of the Onondagas was often known by the title of
<i>Sakosennakehte</i>,<br>
"the Name-carrier." [Footnote: "Il y avait en cette bande un
Capitaine<br>
qui porte'le nom le plus considerable de toute sa Nation,<br>
Sagochiendagehte."&mdash;<i>Relation</i> of 1654, p. 8. Elsewhere, as
in the<br>
<i>Relation</i> for 1657, p. 17, this name is spelt
Agochiendaguete.]</p>

<p>The name of the Oneida nation in the Council was<br>
<i>Nihatirontakowa</i>&mdash;or, in the Onondaga dialect,<br>
<i>Nihatientakona</i>&mdash;usually rendered the "Great-Tree<br>
People,"&mdash;literally, "those of the great log." It is derived
from<br>
<i>karonta</i>, a fallen tree or piece of timber, with the
suffix<br>
<i>kowa</i> or <i>kona</i>, great, added, and the verb-forming
pronoun<br>
prefixed. In the singular number it becomes <i>Niharontakowa</i>,
which<br>
would be understood to mean "He is an Oneida." The name, it is
said, was<br>
given to the nation because when Dekanawidah and Hiawatha first
went to<br>
meet its chief, they crossed the Oneida creek on a bridge
composed of an<br>
immense tree which had fallen or been laid across it, and noted
that the<br>
Council fire at which the treaty was concluded was kindled
against<br>
another huge log. These, however, may be merely explanations
invented in<br>
later times.</p>

<p>The Cayugas bore in Council the name of
<i>Sotinonnawentona</i>, meaning<br>
"the Great-Pipe People." In the singular it is<br>
<i>Sononnawentona</i>. The root of the word is <i>kanonnawen</i>,
which<br>
in composition becomes <i>kanonnawenta</i>, meaning pipe, or
calumet. It<br>
is said that the chief who in the first Council represented the
Cayugas<br>
smoked a pipe of unusual size, which attracted the notice of
the<br>
"name-givers."</p>

<p>Finally the Seneca mountaineers, the <i>Sonnontowanas</i>,
bore the<br>
title, in the Canienga speech, of <i>Ronaninhohonti</i>, "the<br>
Door-keepers," or literally, "they who are at the doorway." In
the<br>
singular this becomes <i>Roninhohonti</i>. In the Onondaga
dialect it is<br>
<i>Honinhohonta</i>. It is a verbal form, derived from
<i>Kanhoha</i>,<br>
door, and <i>ont</i>, to be. This name is undoubtedly coeval with
the<br>
formation of the League, and was bestowed as a title of honor.
The<br>
Senecas, at the western end of the "extended mansion," guarded
the<br>
entrance against the wild tribes in that quarter, whose hostility
was<br>
most to be dreaded.</p>

<p>The enumeration of the chiefs who formed the confederacy is
closed by<br>
the significant words, "and then, in later times, additions were
made to<br>
the great edifice." This is sufficient evidence that the Canienga
"Book<br>
of Rites" was composed in its present form after the Tuscaroras,
and<br>
possibly after the Nanticokes and Tuteloes, were received into
the<br>
League. The Tuscaroras were admitted in 1714; the two other
nations<br>
were received about the year 1753. [Footnote: The former date is
well<br>
known; for the latter, see <i>N. Y. Hist. Col.</i>, Vol. 6, p.
311;<br>
Stone's <i>Life of Sir William Johnson</i>, p. 434.]</p>

<p>An outburst of lamentation follows. The speaker has recited
the names of<br>
the heroes and statesmen to whom the united nations were indebted
for<br>
the Great Peace which had so long prevailed among them. He has
recalled<br>
the wise laws which they established; and he is about to chant
the<br>
closing litany, commemorating the fifty chiefs who composed the
first<br>
federal council, and whose names have remained as the official
titles of<br>
their successors. In recalling these memories of departed
greatness his<br>
mind is filled with grief and humiliation at the contrast
presented by<br>
the degeneracy of his own days. It is a common complaint of
all<br>
countries and all times; but the sentiment was always, according
to the<br>
missionaries, especially strong among the Indians, who are a<br>
conservative race. The orator appeals to the shades of their
ancestors,<br>
in words which, in the baldest of literal versions, are full
of<br>
eloquence and pathos. The "great law" has become old, and has
lost its<br>
force. Its authors have passed away, and have carried it with
them into<br>
their graves. They have placed it as a pillow under their heads.
Their<br>
degenerate successors have inherited their names, but not their
mighty<br>
intellects; and in the flourishing region which they left, naught
but a<br>
desert remains. A trace, and not a slight one, of the mournful
sublimity<br>
which we admire in the Hebrew prophets, with a similar cadence
of<br>
"parallelism" in the style, will be noticed in this forest
lament.</p>

<p>The same characteristics mark the chanted litany which closes
the<br>
address. There is not merely parallelism and cadence, but
occasionally<br>
rhyme, in the stanzas which are interspersed among the names, as
is seen<br>
in the oft-repeated chorus which follows the names composing each
clan<br>
or "class":&mdash;</p>

<p> Etho natejonhne,<br>
 Sewaterihwakhaonghkwe,<br>
 Sewarihwisaanonghkwe,<br>
 Kayaterenhkowa. [Footnote: For the translation, see <i>ante</i>,
p. 33.]</p>

<p>This litany is sung in the usual style of their mourning or
religious<br>
chants, with many long-drawn repetitions of the customary
ejaculation<br>
<i>haihhaih</i>,&mdash;an exclamation which, like the Greek "ai! ai!"
belongs<br>
to the wailing style appropriate to such a monody. The
expressions of<br>
the chant, like those of a Greek chorus, are abrupt, elliptical,
and<br>
occasionally obscure. It is probable that this chant, like the
condoling<br>
Hymn in the former part of the Book, is of earlier style than the
other<br>
portions of the work, their rhythmical form having preserved
the<br>
original words with greater accuracy. Such explanations of the
doubtful<br>
passages as could be obtained from the chiefs and the
interpreters will<br>
be found in the notes.</p>

<p>The chant and the Book end abruptly with the mournful
exclamation, "Now<br>
we are dejected in *mind." The lament which precedes the litany,
and<br>
which is interrupted by it, may be said to close with these
words. As<br>
the council is held, nominally at least, for the purpose of
condolence,<br>
and as it necessarily revives the memory of the departed worthies
of<br>
their republic, it is natural that the ceremonies throughout
should be<br>
of a melancholy cast. They were doubtless so from the beginning,
and<br>
before there was any occasion to deplore the decay of their
commonwealth<br>
or the degeneracy of the age. In fact, when we consider that
the<br>
founders of the League, with remarkable skill and judgment,
managed to<br>
compress into a single day the protracted and wasteful
obsequies<br>
customary among other tribes of the same race, we shall not be
surprised<br>
to find that they sought to make the ceremonies of the day as
solemn and<br>
impressive as possible.</p>

<p>But there are other characteristics of the "Book of Rites,"
prominent in<br>
the Canienga section, and still more marked in the Onondaga
portion,<br>
which may well excite our astonishment. They have been already
noticed,<br>
but seem to deserve fuller consideration. It will be observed
that, from<br>
beginning to end, the Book breathes nothing but sentiments of
kindness<br>
and sympathy for the living, and of reverence for the
departed,&mdash;not<br>
merely for the chief whom they have come to mourn, but also for
the<br>
great men who have preceded him, and especially for the founders
of<br>
their commonwealth. Combined with these sentiments, and
harmonizing<br>
with them, is an earnest desire for peace, along with a profound
respect<br>
for the laws under which they lived. The work in which these
feelings<br>
are expressed is a genuine composition of the Indians themselves,
framed<br>
long before they were affected by any influences from abroad,
and<br>
repeated among them for centuries, with the entire assent of
the<br>
hearers. It affords unquestionable evidence of the true character
both<br>
of those who composed and of those who received it.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p>THE IROQUOIS CHARACTER.</p>

<p>The popular opinion of the Indian, and more especially of the
Iroquois,<br>
who, as Mr. Parkman well observes, is an "Indian of the
Indians,"<br>
represents him as a sanguinary, treacherous and vindictive
being,<br>
somewhat cold in his affections, haughty and reserved toward
his<br>
friends, merciless to his enemies, fond of strife, and averse
to<br>
industry and the pursuits of peace. Some magnanimous traits
are<br>
occasionally allowed to him; and poetry and romance have
sometimes<br>
thrown a glamour about his character, which popular opinion, not
without<br>
reason, energetically repudiates and resents. The truth is that
the<br>
circumstances under which the red and white races have
encountered in<br>
North America have been such as necessarily to give rise to a
wholly<br>
false impression in regard to the character of the aborigines.
The<br>
European colonists, superior in civilization and in the arts of
war,<br>
landed on the coast with the deliberate intention of taking
possession<br>
of the country and displacing the natives. The Indians were at
once<br>
thrown on the defensive. From the very beginning they fought, not
merely<br>
for their land, but for their lives; for it was from their land
that<br>
they drew the means of living. All wars between the whites and
the<br>
Indians, whatever the color or pretence on either side, have been
on<br>
both sides wars of extermination. They have been carried on as
such wars<br>
always have been and always will be carried on. On the side of
the<br>
stronger there have been constant encroachments, effected now by
menace<br>
and now by cajolery, but always prefaced by the display and
the<br>
insolence of superior power. On the side of the weaker there have
been<br>
alternations of sullen acquiescence and of fierce and
fruitless<br>
resistance. It is not surprising that under such circumstances
the<br>
character of each party has been presented to the other in the
most<br>
forbidding light.</p>

<p>The Indians must be judged, like every other people, not by
the traits<br>
which they display in the fury of a desperate warfare, but by
their<br>
ordinary demeanor in time of peace, and especially by the
character of<br>
their social and domestic life. On this point the testimony
of<br>
missionaries and of other competent observers who have lived
among them<br>
is uniform. At home the Indians are the most kindly and generous
of<br>
men. Constant good humor, unfailing courtesy, ready sympathy
with<br>
distress, and a truly lavish liberality, mark their intercourse
with one<br>
another. The Jesuit missionaries among the Hurons knew them
before<br>
intercourse with the whites and the use of ardent spirits had
embittered<br>
and debased them. The testimony which they have left on record is
very<br>
remarkable. The missionary Brebeuf, protesting against the
ignorant<br>
prejudice which would place the Indians on a level with the
brutes,<br>
gives the result of his observation in emphatic terms. "In my
opinion,"<br>
he writes, "it is no small matter to say of them that they live
united<br>
in towns, sometimes of fifty, sixty, or a hundred dwellings, that
is, of<br>
three or four hundred households; that they cultivate the fields,
from<br>
which they derive their food for the whole year; and that they
maintain<br>
peace and friendship with one another." He doubts "if there is
another<br>
nation under heaven more commendable in this respect" than the
Huron<br>
"nation of the Bear," among whom he resided. "They have," he
declares,<br>
"a gentleness and an affability almost incredible for
barbarians." They<br>
keep up "this perfect goodwill," as he terms it, "by frequent
visits, by<br>
the aid which they give one another in sickness, and by their
festivals<br>
and social gatherings, whenever they are not occupied by their
fields<br>
and fisheries, or in hunting or trade." "They are," he continues,
"less<br>
in their own cabins than in those of their friends. If any one
falls<br>
sick, and wants something which may benefit him, everybody is
eager to<br>
furnish it. Whenever one of them has something specially good to
eat, he<br>
invites his friends and makes a feast. Indeed, they hardly ever
eat<br>
alone." [Footnote: <i>Relation</i> for 1636, p. 117.]</p>

<p>The Iroquois, who had seemed little better than demons to
the<br>
missionaries while they knew them only as enemies to the French
or their<br>
Huron allies, astonished them, on a nearer acquaintance, by
the<br>
development of similar traits of natural goodness. "You will find
in<br>
them," declares one of these fair-minded and cultivated
observers,<br>
"virtues which might well put to blush the majority of
Christians. There<br>
is no need of hospitals among them, because there are no beggars
among<br>
them, and indeed, none who are poor, so long as any of them
are<br>
rich. Their kindness, humanity and courtesy not merely make them
liberal<br>
in giving, but almost lead them to live as though everything
they<br>
possess were held in common. No one can want food while there is
corn<br>
anywhere in the town." It is true that the missionaries often
accuse the<br>
Iroquois of cruelty and perfidy; but the narrative shows that
these<br>
qualities were only displayed in their wars, and apparently only
against<br>
enemies whose cruelty and perfidy they had experienced.</p>

<p>We can now see that the plan of universal federation and
general peace<br>
which Hiawatha devised had nothing in itself so surprising as to
excite<br>
our incredulity. It was, indeed, entirely in accordance with the
genius<br>
of his people. Its essence was the extension to all nations of
the<br>
methods of social and civil life which prevailed in his own
nation. If<br>
the people of a town of four hundred families could live in
constant<br>
"peace and friendship," why should not all the tribes of men
dwell<br>
together in the same manner? The idea is one which might readily
have<br>
occurred to any man of benevolent feelings and thoughtful<br>
temperament. The project in itself is not so remarkable as the
energy<br>
and skill with which it was carried into effect. It is deserving
of<br>
notice, however, that according to the Indian tradition, Hiawatha
was<br>
impelled to action mainly by experience of the mischiefs which
were<br>
caused in his own nation through a departure from their ordinary
system<br>
of social life. The missionaries, in describing the general
harmony<br>
which prevailed among the Hurons, admit that it was sometimes<br>
disturbed. There were "bad spirits" among them, as everywhere
else, who<br>
could not always be controlled. [Footnote: <i>Relation of
1636</i>,<br>
p. 118: "Ostez quelques mauvais esprits, qui se rencontrent
quasi<br>
partout," etc.] Atotarho, among the Onondagas, was one of these
bad<br>
spirits; and in his case, unfortunately, an evil disposition
was<br>
reinforced by a keen intellect and a powerful will. His history
for a<br>
time offered a rare instance of something approaching to
despotism, or<br>
the Greek "tyranny," exercised in an Indian tribe. A fact so
strange,<br>
and conduct so extraordinary, seemed in after-times to
require<br>
explanation. A legend is preserved among the Onondagas, which
was<br>
apparently devised to account for a prodigy so far out of the
common<br>
order of events. I give it in the words in which it is recorded
in my<br>
journal. [Footnote: This story was related to me in March, 1882,
by my<br>
intelligent friend, Chief John Buck, who was inclined to give
it<br>
credence,&mdash;sharing in this, as in other things, the sentiments of
the<br>
best among his people.]</p>

<p>"Another legend, of which I have not before heard, professed
to give the<br>
origin both of the abnormal ferocity and of the preterhuman
powers of<br>
Atotarho. He was already noted as a chief and a warrior, when he
had the<br>
misfortune to kill a peculiar bird, resembling a sea-gull, which
is<br>
reputed to possess poisonous qualities of singular virulence. By
his<br>
contact with the dead bird his mind was affected. He became
morose and<br>
cruel, and at the same time obtained the power of destroying men
and<br>
other creatures at a distance. Three sons of Hiawatha were among
his<br>
victims. He attended the Councils which were held, and made
confusion in<br>
them, and brought all the people into disturbance and terror. His
bodily<br>
appearance was changed at the same time, and his aspect became
so<br>
terrible that the story spread, and was believed, that his head
was<br>
encircled by living snakes."</p>

<p>The only importance of this story is in the evidence it
affords that<br>
conduct so anti-social as that of Atotarho was deemed to be the
result<br>
of a disordered mind. In his case, as in that of the Scottish
tyrant and<br>
murderer, "the insane root that took the reason prisoner," was
doubtless<br>
an unbridled ambition. It is interesting to remark that even his
fierce<br>
temper and determined will were forced to yield at last to the
pressure<br>
of public opinion, which compelled him to range himself on the
side of<br>
peace and union. In the whimsical imagery of the narrative, which
some<br>
of the story-tellers, after their usual fashion, have converted
from a<br>
metaphor to a fact, Hiawatha "combed the snakes out of the head"
of his<br>
great antagonist, and presented him to the Council changed and
restored<br>
to his right mind.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p>THE IROQUOIS POLICY.</p>

<p>Few popular notions, it may be affirmed, are so far from the
truth as<br>
that which makes the Iroquois a band of treacherous and
ferocious<br>
ravagers, whose career was marked everywhere by cruelty and<br>
devastation. The clear and positive evidence of historical facts
leads<br>
to a widely different conclusion. It is not going too far to
assert<br>
that among all uncivilized races the Iroquois have shown
themselves to<br>
be the most faithful of allies, the most placable of enemies, and
the<br>
most clement of conquerors. It will be proper, in justice to
them, as<br>
well as in the interest of political and social science, to
present<br>
briefly the principles and methods which guided them in their<br>
intercourse with other communities. Their system, as finally
developed,<br>
comprised four distinct forms of connection with other nations,
all<br>
tending directly to the establishment of universal peace.</p>

<p>1. As has been already said, the primary object of the
founders of their<br>
League was the creation of a confederacy which should comprise
all the<br>
nations and tribes of men that were known to them. Experience,
however,<br>
quickly showed that this project, admirable in idea, was
impossible of<br>
execution. Distance, differences of language, and difficulties
of<br>
communication, presented obstacles which could not be overcome.
But the<br>
plan was kept in view as one of the cardinal principles of
their<br>
policy. They were always eager to receive new members into
their<br>
League. The Tuscaroras, the Nanticokes, the Tuteloes, and a band
of the<br>
Delawares, were thus successively admitted, and all of them still
retain<br>
representative in the Council of the Canadian branch of the
confederacy.</p>

<p>2. When this complete political union could not be achieved,
the<br>
Iroquois sought to accomplish the same end, as far as possible,
by a<br>
treaty of alliance. Two notable examples will show how earnestly
this<br>
purpose was pursued, and how firmly it was maintained. When the
Dutch<br>
established their trading settlements on the Hudson River, one of
their<br>
first proceedings was to send an embassy to the Five Nations,
with<br>
proposals for a treaty. The overture was promptly accepted. A
strict<br>
alliance was formed, and was ratified in the usual manner by an
exchange<br>
of wampum belts. When the English took the place of the Dutch,
the<br>
treaty was renewed with them, and was confirmed in the same
manner. The<br>
wampum-belts then received by the Confederates are still
preserved on<br>
their Canadian Reservation, and are still brought forth and
expounded by<br>
the older chiefs to the younger generation, in their great<br>
Councils. History records with what unbroken faith, through
many<br>
changes, and despite many provocations from their allies and
many<br>
enticements from the French rulers and missionaries, this
alliance was<br>
maintained to the last.</p>

<p>If it be suggested that this fidelity was strengthened by
motives of<br>
policy, the same cannot be affirmed of the alliance with the
Ojibways,<br>
which dates from a still earlier period. The annalists of the<br>
Kanonsionni affirm that their first treaty with this widespread
people<br>
of the northwest was made soon after the formation of their
League, and<br>
that it was strictly maintained on both sides for more than two
hundred<br>
years. The Ojibways then occupied both shores of Lake Superior,
and the<br>
northern part of the peninsula of Michigan. The point at which
they came<br>
chiefly in contact with the adventurous Iroquois voyagers was at
the<br>
great fishing station of St. Mary's Falls, on the strait which
unites<br>
Lake Superior with Lake Huron; and here, it is believed, the
first<br>
alliance was consummated. After more than two centuries had
elapsed, the<br>
broken bands of the defeated Hurons, fleeing from their ravaged
homes on<br>
the Georgian Bay, took refuge among the Ojibways, with whom they,
too,<br>
had always maintained a friendly understanding. Their presence
and the<br>
story of their sufferings naturally awakened the sympathy of
their<br>
hosts. The rapid spread of the Iroquois empire created alarm. A
great<br>
agitation ensued among the far-dispersed bands of the Ojibway<br>
name. Occasional meetings between hunting-parties of the
younger<br>
warriors of the two peoples,&mdash;the Iroquois arrogant in the
consciousness<br>
of their recent conquests, the Ojibways sullen and
suspicious,&mdash;led to<br>
bitter words, and sometimes to actual strife. On two occasions
several<br>
Ojibway warriors were slain, under what provocation is uncertain.
But<br>
the reparation demanded by the Ojibway chiefs was promptly
conceded by<br>
the Iroquois Council. The amplest apology was made, and for every
slain<br>
warrior a pack of furs was delivered. The ancient treaty was at
the same<br>
time renewed, with every formality. Nothing could more clearly
show the<br>
anxiety of the Iroquois rulers to maintain their national faith
than<br>
this apology and reparation, so readily made by them, at the time
when<br>
their people were at the height of their power and in the full
flush of<br>
conquest. [Footnote: The Ojibway historian, Copway, in his<br>
"<i>Traditional History of the Ojibway Nation</i>" (p. 84), gives
the<br>
particulars of this event, as preserved by the Ojibways
themselves. Even<br>
the strong national prejudice of the narrator, which has
evidently<br>
colored his statement, leaves the evidence of the magnanimity
and<br>
prudence of the Iroquois elders clearly apparent.] These
efforts,<br>
however, to preserve the ancient amity proved unavailing. Through
whose<br>
fault it was that the final outbreak occurred is a question which
the<br>
annalists of the two parties differ. But the events just
recounted, and,<br>
indeed, all the circumstances, speak strongly in favor of the
Iroquois.<br>
They had shown their anxiety to maintain the peace, and they had
nothing<br>
to gain by war. The bleak northern home of the Ojibways offered
no<br>
temptation to the most greedy conqueror. To the Ojibways, on the
other<br>
hand, the broad expanse of western Canada, now lying deserted,
and<br>
stretching before them its wealth of forests full of deer, its
lakes and<br>
rivers swarming with fish, its lovely glades and fertile plains,
where<br>
the corn harvests of the Hurons and Neutrals had lately
glistened, were<br>
an allurement which they could not resist. They assumed at once
the<br>
wrongs and the territories of their exiled Huron friends, and
plunged<br>
into the long-meditated strife with their ancient allies. The
contest<br>
was desperate and destructive. Many sanguinary battles took
place, and<br>
great numbers of warriors fell on both sides. On the whole the
balance<br>
inclined against the Iroquois. In this war they were a southern
people,<br>
contending against a hardier race from the far north. They fought
at a<br>
distance from their homes, while the Ojibways, migrating in
bands,<br>
pitched their habitations in the disputed region.</p>

<p>Finally, both sides became weary of the strife. Old sentiments
of<br>
fellowship revived. Peace was declared, and a new treaty was
made. The<br>
territory for which they had fought was divided between them.
The<br>
southwestern portion, which had been the home of the
Attiwandaronks,<br>
remained as the hunting-ground of the Iroquois. North and east of
this<br>
section the Ojibways possessed the land. The new treaty,
confirmed by<br>
the exchange of wampum-belts and by a peculiar interlocking of
the right<br>
arms, which has ever since been the special sign of amity between
the<br>
Iroquois and the Ojibways, was understood to make them not merely
allies<br>
but brothers. As the symbol on one of the belts which is still
preserved<br>
indicates, they were to be as relatives who are so nearly akin
that they<br>
eat from the same dish. This treaty, made two centuries ago, has
ever<br>
since been religiously maintained. Its effects are felt to
this<br>
day. Less than forty years ago a band of the Ojibways, the
Missisagas,<br>
forced to relinquish their reserved lands on the River Credit,
sought a<br>
refuge with the Iroquois of the Grand River Reservation. They
appealed<br>
to this treaty, and to the evidence of the wampum-belts. Their
appeal<br>
was effectual. A large tract of valuable land was granted to them
by the<br>
Six Nations. Here, maintaining their distinct tribal
organization, they<br>
still reside, a living evidence of the constancy and liberality
with<br>
which the Iroquois uphold their treaty obligations.</p>

<p>3. When a neighboring people would neither join the
confederacy nor<br>
enter into a treaty of alliance with it, the almost inevitable
result<br>
would be, sooner or later, a deadly war. Among the nomadic or
unsettled<br>
Indian tribes, especially the Algonkins and Sioux, the young men
are<br>
expected to display their bravery by taking scalps; and a race
of<br>
farmers, hunters, and fishermen, like the Iroquois, would be
tempting<br>
victims. Before the confederacy was formed, some of its
members,<br>
particularly the Caniengas and Oneidas, had suffered greatly from
wars<br>
with the wilder tribes about them. The new strength derived from
the<br>
League enabled them to turn the tables upon their adversaries.
But they<br>
made a magnanimous use of their superiority. An enemy who
submitted was<br>
at once spared. When the great Delaware nation, the Lenapes,
known as<br>
the head of the Algonkin stock, yielded to the arms of the
Kanonsionni,<br>
they were allowed to retain their territory and nearly all
their<br>
property. They were simply required to acknowledge themselves
the<br>
subjects of the Iroquois, to pay a moderate tribute in wampum and
furs,<br>
and to refrain thenceforth from taking any part in war. In
the<br>
expressive Indian phrase, they were "made women." This phrase did
not<br>
even imply, according to Iroquois ideas, any serious humiliation;
for<br>
among them, as the French missionaries tell us, women had
much<br>
authority. [Footnote: "Les femmes ayant beaucoup
d'autorit&eacute; parmi ces<br>
peuples, leur vertu y fait d'autant plus de fruit qu'autre<br>
part."&mdash;<i>Relation of</i> 1657, p. 48.] Their special office in
war was<br>
that of peace-makers. It was deemed to be their right and duty,
when in<br>
their opinion the strife had lasted long enough, to interfere and
bring<br>
about a reconciliation. The knowledge of this fact led the
Lenapes, in<br>
aftertimes, to put forward a whimsical claim to dignity, which
was<br>
accepted by their worthy but credulous historian, Heckewelder.
They<br>
asserted that while their nation was at the height of power,
their<br>
ancestors were persuaded by the insidious wiles of the Iroquois
to lay<br>
aside their arms, for the purpose of assuming the lofty position
of<br>
universal mediators and arbiters among the Indian nations.
[Footnote:<br>
Heckewelder's <i>History of the Indian Nations</i>, p. 56.] That
this<br>
preposterous story should have found credence is surprising
enough. A<br>
single fact suffices to disprove it, and to show the terms on
which the<br>
Delawares stood with the great northern confederacy. Golden
has<br>
preserved for us the official record of the Council which was
held in<br>
Philadelphia, in July, 1742, between the provincial authorities
and the<br>
deputies of the Six Nations, headed by their noted orator and
statesman,<br>
the great Onondaga chief, Canasatego. The Delawares, whose claim
to<br>
certain lands was to be decided, attended the conference. The
Onondaga<br>
leader, after reciting the evidence which had been laid before
him to<br>
show that these lands had been sold to the colonists by the
Delawares,<br>
and severely rebuking the latter for their breach of faith in<br>
repudiating the bargain, continued: "But how came you to take
upon you<br>
to sell land at all? We conquered you. We made women of you. You
know<br>
you are women, and can no more sell land than women. Nor is it
fit that<br>
you should have the power of selling lands, since you would
abuse<br>
it. This very land that you now claim has been consumed by you.
You have<br>
had it in meat and drink and clothes, and now you want it again,
like<br>
children, as you are. But what makes you sell land in the dark?
Did you<br>
ever tell us that you had sold this land? Did we ever receive any
part<br>
of the price, even the value of a pipe-stem from you? You have
told us a<br>
blind story&mdash;that you sent a messenger to inform us of the sale;
but he<br>
never came among us, nor have we ever heard anything about it.
And for<br>
all these reasons we charge you to remove instantly. We don't
give you<br>
the liberty to think about it. We assign you two places to go,
either to<br>
Wyoming or Shamokin. You may go to either of those places, and
then we<br>
shall have you more under our eyes, and shall see how you behave.
Don't<br>
deliberate, but remove away; and take this belt of wampum."
[Footnote:<br>
Golden: <i>History of the Five Nations</i>, Vol. II, p. 36
(2d<br>
Edition).]</p>

<p>This imperious allocution, such as a Cinna or a Cornelius
might have<br>
delivered to a crowd of trembling and sullen Greeks, shows
plainly<br>
enough the relation in which the two communities stood to one<br>
another. It proves also that the rule under which the
conquered<br>
Delawares were held was anything but oppressive. They seem to
have been<br>
allowed almost entire freedom, except only in making war and
in<br>
disposing of their lands without the consent of the Six Nations.
In<br>
fact, the Iroquois, in dealing with them, anticipated the
very<br>
regulations which the enlightened governments of the United
States and<br>
England now enforce in that benevolent treatment of the Indian
tribes<br>
for which they justly claim high credit. Can they refuse a like
credit<br>
to their dusky predecessors and exemplars, or deny them the
praise of<br>
being, as has been already said, the most clement of
conquerors?</p>

<p>4. Finally, when a tribe within what may be called "striking
distance"<br>
of the Confederacy would neither join the League, nor enter into
an<br>
alliance with its members, nor come under their protection,
there<br>
remained nothing but a chronic state of warfare, which destroyed
all<br>
sense of security and comfort. The Iroquois hunter, fisherman,
or<br>
trader, returning home after a brief absence, could never be sure
that<br>
he would not find his dwelling a heap of embers, smoldering over
the<br>
mangled remains of his wife and children. The plainest dictates
of<br>
policy taught the Confederates that the only safe method in
dealing with<br>
such persistent and unappeasable foes was to crush them utterly.
Among<br>
the most dangerous of their enemies were the Hurons and the
eastern<br>
Algonkins, sustained and encouraged by the French colonists. It
is from<br>
them and their historians chiefly that the complaints of
Iroquois<br>
cruelties have descended to us; but the same historians have not
omitted<br>
to inform us that the first acquaintance of the Iroquois with
triese<br>
colonists was through two most wanton and butcherly assaults
which<br>
Champlain and his soldiers, in company with their Indian allies,
made<br>
upon their unoffending neighbors. No milder epithets can justly
describe<br>
these unprovoked invasions, in which the Iroquois bowmen,
defending<br>
their homes, were shot down mercilessly with firearms, by
strangers whom<br>
they had never before seen or perhaps even heard of. This stroke
of evil<br>
policy, which tarnished an illustrious name, left
far-reaching<br>
consequences, affecting the future of half a continent. Its first
result<br>
was the destruction of the Hurons, the special allies and
instigators of<br>
the colonists in their hostilities. The Attiwandaronks, or
Neutrals,<br>
with whom, till this time, the Iroquois had maintained
peaceful<br>
relations, shared the same fate; for they were the friends of the
Hurons<br>
and the French. The Eries perished in a war provoked, as the
French<br>
missionaries in their always trustworthy accounts inform us, by
a<br>
perverse freak of cruelty on their own part.</p>

<p>Yet, in all these destructive wars, the Iroquois never for a
moment<br>
forgot the principles which lay at the foundation of their
League, and<br>
which taught them to "strengthen their house" by converting
enemies into<br>
friends. On the instant that resistance ceased, slaughter ceased
with<br>
it. The warriors who were willing to unite their fortunes with
the<br>
Confederates were at once welcomed among them. Some were adopted
into<br>
the families of those who had lost children or brothers. Others
had<br>
lands allotted to them, on which they were allowed to live by<br>
themselves, under their own chiefs and their native laws, until
in two<br>
or three generations, by friendly intercourse, frequent
intermarriages,<br>
and community of interests, they became gradually absorbed into
the<br>
society about them. Those who suppose that the Hurons only
survive in a<br>
few Wyandots, and that the Eries, Attiwandaronks, and Andastes
have<br>
utterly perished, are greatly mistaken. It is absolutely certain
that of<br>
the twelve thousand Indians who now, in the United States and
Canada,<br>
preserve the Iroquois name, the greater portion derive their
descent, in<br>
whole or in part, from those conquered nations. [Footnote: "Ces
victoires<br>
lear caasant presque autant de perte qu'a leurs ennemis, elles
ont<br>
tellement depeupl&eacute; leurs Bourgs, qu'on y compte plus
d'Estfangers que de<br>
naturels du pays. Onnontaghe a sept nations differentes qut s'y
sont<br>
venues establir, et il s'en trouve jusqu'a onze dans
Sonnontoiian."<br>
<i>Relation of</i> 1657, p. 34. "Qui feroit la supputation des
francs<br>
Iroquois, auroit de la peine d'en trouver plus de douze cents<br>
(i. e. combattans) en toutes les cinq Nations, parce que le plus
grand<br>
nombre n'est compose que d'un ramas de divers peuples qu'ils
ont<br>
conquestez, commes des Hurons, des Tionnontateronnons, autrement
Nation<br>
du Petun; des Attiwendaronk, qu'on appelloit Neutres, quand ils
estoient<br>

Chats; des<br>
Ontwaganha, ou Nation du Feu; des Trakwaehronnons, et autres,
qui, tout<br>
estrangers qu'ils sont, font sans doute la plus grande et la
meilleure<br>
parties des Iroquois." <i>Ret. de</i> 1660, p. 7. Yet, it was
this<br>
"conglomeration of divers peoples" that, under the discipline
of<br>
Iroquois institutions and the guidance of Iroquois statesmen
and<br>
commanders, held high the name of the Kanonsionni, and made
the<br>
Confederacy a great power on the continent for more than a
century after<br>
this time; who again and again measured arms and intellects with
French<br>
generals and diplomatists, and came off at least with equal
fortune; who<br>
smote their Abenaki enemies in the far east, punished the
Illinois<br>
marauders in the far west, and thrust back the intruding
Cherokees into<br>
their southern mountains; who were a wall of defence to the
English<br>
colonies, and a strong protection to the many broken bands of
Indians<br>
which from every quarter clustered round the shadow of the "great
pine<br>
tree" of Onondaga.] No other Indian community, so far as we know,
has<br>
ever pursued this policy of incorporation to anything near the
same<br>
extent, or carried it out with anything like the same humanity.
Even<br>
towards the most determined and the most savage of their foes,
the<br>
Kanonsionni, when finally victorious, showed themselves ever
magnanimous<br>
and placable.</p>

<p>The common opinion of the cruelty of the Iroquois has arisen
mainly from<br>
the custom which they occasionally practiced, like some other
Indians,<br>
of burning prisoners at the stake. Out of the multitude of
their<br>
captives, the number subjected to this torture was really
very<br>
small,&mdash;probably not nearly as large in proportion as the number
of<br>
criminals and political prisoners who, in some countries of
Europe, at<br>
about the same time, were subjected to the equally cruel torments
of the<br>
rack and the wheel. These criminals and other prisoners were so
tortured<br>
because they were regarded as the enemies of society. The motives
which<br>
actuated the Iroquois were precisely the same. As has been
before<br>
remarked, the mode in which their enemies carried on their
warfare with<br>
them was chiefly by stealthy and sudden inroads. The prowling
warrior<br>
lurked in the woods near the Iroquois village through the day,
and at<br>
night fell with hatchet and club upon his unsuspecting victims.
The<br>
Iroquois lawgivers deemed it essential for the safety of their
people<br>
that the men who were guilty of such murderous attacks should
have<br>
reason to apprehend, if caught, a direful fate.</p>

<p>If the comparatively few instances of these political tortures
which<br>
occurred among the Iroquois are compared with the awful list of
similar<br>
and worse inflictions which stain the annals of the most
enlightened<br>
nations of Europe and Asia, ancient and modern,&mdash;the
crucifixions, the<br>
impalements, the dreadful mutilations&mdash;lopping of hands and
feet,<br>
tearing out of eyes&mdash;the tortures of the rack and wheel, the
red-hot<br>
pincers, the burning crown, the noisome dungeon, the slow
starvation,<br>
the lingering death in the Siberian mines,&mdash;it will become
evident that<br>
these barbarians were far inferior to their civilized
contemporaries in<br>
the temper and arts of inhumanity. Even in the very method of
punishment<br>
which they adopted the Indians were outdone in Europe, and
that,<br>
strangely enough, by the two great colonizing and conquering
nations,<br>
heirs of all modern enlightenment, who came to displace
them,&mdash;the<br>
English and the Spaniards. The Iroquois never burnt women at
the<br>
stake. To put either men or women to death for a difference of
creed had<br>
not occurred to them. It may justly be affirmed that in the
horrors of<br>
Smithfield and the Campo Santo, the innate barbarism of the
Aryan,<br>
breaking through his thin varnish of civilization, was found,
far<br>
transcending the utmost barbarism of the Indian. [Footnote: The
Aryans<br>
of Europe are undoubtedly superior in humanity, courage and<br>
independence, to those of Asia. It is possible that the finer
qualities<br>
which distinguish the western branch of this stock may have been
derived<br>
from admixture with an earlier population of Europe, identical in
race<br>
and character with the aborigines of America. See Appendix, Note

<p>As the mental faculties of a people are reflected in their
speech, we<br>
should naturally expect that the language of a race manifesting
such<br>
unusual powers as the Iroquois nations have displayed would be of
a<br>
remarkable character. In this expectation we are not
disappointed. The<br>
languages of the Huron-Iroquois family belong to what has been
termed<br>
the polysynthetic class, and are distinguished, even in that
class, by a<br>
more than ordinary endowment of that variety of forms and
fullness of<br>
expression for which languages of that type are noted. The<br>
best-qualified judges have been the most struck with this
peculiar<br>
excellence. "The variety of compounds," wrote the
accomplished<br>
missionary, Brebeuf, concerning the Huron tongue, "is very great;
it is<br>
the key to the secret of their language. They have as many
genders as<br>
ourselves, as many numbers as the Greeks." Recurring to the
same<br>
comparison, he remarks of the Huron verb that it has as many
tenses and<br>
numbers as the Greek, with certain discriminations which the
latter did<br>
not possess. [Footnote: <i>Relation</i> of 1636, pp 99,100.] A
great<br>
living authority has added the weight of his name to these
opinions of<br>
the scholarly Jesuit. Professor Max Muller, who took the
opportunity<br>
afforded by the presence of a Mohawk undergraduate at Oxford to
study<br>
his language, writes of it in emphatic terms: "To my mind the
structure<br>
of such a language as the Mohawk is quite sufficient evidence
that those<br>
who worked out such a work of art were powerful reasoners and
accurate<br>
classifiers." [Footnote: In a letter to the author, dated Feb.
14,<br>
1882. In a subsequent letter Prof. Muller writes, in regard to
the study<br>
of the aboriginal languages of this continent: "It has long been
a<br>
puzzle to me why this most tempting and promising field of
philological<br>
research has been allowed to lie almost fallow in America,&mdash;as if
these<br>
languages could not tell us quite as much of the growth of the
human<br>
mind as Chinese, or Hebrew, or Sanscrit." I have Prof. Max
Miller's<br>
permission to publish these extracts, and gladly do so, in the
hope that<br>
they may serve to stimulate that growing interest which the
efforts of<br>
scholars like Trumbull, Shea, Cuoq, Brinton, and, more recently,
Major<br>
Powell and his able collaborators of the Ethnological Bureau, are
at<br>
length beginning to awaken among us, in the investigation of
this<br>
important and almost unexplored province of linguistic
science.]</p>

<p>It is a fact somewhat surprising, as well as unfortunate, that
no<br>
complete grammar of any language of the Huron-Iroquois stock has
ever<br>
been published. Many learned and zealous missionaries, Catholic
and<br>
Protestant, have labored among the tribes of this stock for more
than<br>
two centuries. Portions of the Scriptures, as well as some other
works,<br>
have been translated into several of these languages. Some small
books,<br>
including biographies and hymn-books, have been composed and
printed in<br>
two of them; and the late devoted and indefatigable missionary
among the<br>
Senecas, the Rev. Asher Wright, conducted for several years a<br>
periodical, the "Mental Elevator" (<i>Ne Jaguhnigoageswatha</i>),
in<br>
their language. Several grammars are known to have been composed,
but<br>
none have as yet been printed in a complete form. One reason of
this<br>
unwillingness to publish was, undoubtedly, the sense which the
compilers<br>
felt of the insufficiency of their work; Such is the
extraordinary<br>
complexity of the language, such the multiplicity of its forms
and the<br>
subtlety of its distinctions, that years of study are required to
master<br>
it; and indeed it may be said that the abler the investigator and
the<br>
more careful his study, the more likely he is to be dissatisfied
with<br>
his success. This dissatisfaction was frankly expressed and
practically<br>
exhibited by Mr. Wright himself, certainly one of the best
endowed and<br>
most industrious of these inquirers. After residing for several
years<br>
among the Senecas, forming an alphabet remarkable for its
precise<br>
discrimination of sounds, and even publishing several
translations in<br>
their language, he undertook to give some account of its
grammatical<br>
forms. A little work printed in 1842, with the modest title of
"<i>A<br>
Spelling-book of the Seneca Language</i>," comprises the
variations of<br>
nouns, adjectives and pronouns, given with much minuteness. Those
of the<br>
verbs are promised, but the book closes abruptly without them,
for the<br>
reason&mdash;as the author afterwards explained to a
correspondent&mdash;that he<br>
had not as yet been able to obtain such a complete knowledge of
them as<br>
he desired. This difficulty is further exemplified by a work
purporting<br>
to be a "<i>Grammar of the Huron Language, by a Missionary of
the<br>
Village of Huron Indians, near Quebec, found amongst the papers
of the<br>
Mission, and translated from the Latin, by the Rev. John
Wilkie</i>."<br>
This translation is published in the "<i>Transactions of the
Literary<br>
and Historical Society of Quebec</i>," for 1831, and fills more
than a<br>
hundred octavo pages. It is a work evidently of great labor, and
is<br>
devoted chiefly to the variations of the verbs; yet its lack
of<br>
completeness may be judged from the single fact that the
"transitions,"<br>
or in other words, the combinations of the double pronouns,
nominative<br>
and objective, with the transitive verb, which form such an
important<br>
feature of the language, are hardly noticed; and, it may be
added,<br>
though the conjugations are mentioned, they are not explained.
The work,<br>
indeed, would rather perplex than aid an investigator, and gives
no<br>
proper idea of the character and richness of the language. The
same may<br>
be said of the grammatical notices comprised in the Latin
"Proemium" to<br>
Bruyas' Iroquois dictionary. These notices are apparently modeled
to<br>
some extent on this anonymous grammar of the Huron
language,&mdash;unless,<br>
indeed, the latter may have been copied from Bruyas; the rules
which<br>
they give being in several instances couched in the same
words.</p>

<p>Some useful grammatical explanations are found in the
anonymous Onondaga<br>
dictionary of the seventeenth century, published by Dr. Shea in
his<br>
"<i>Library of American Linguistics</i>." But by far the most
valuable<br>
contribution to our knowledge of the structure of this remarkable
group<br>
of languages is found in the works of a distinguished writer of
our own<br>
day, the Rev. J. A. Cuoq, of Montreal, eminent both as a
missionary and<br>
as a philologist. After twenty years of labor among the Iroquois
and<br>
Algonkin tribes in the Province of Quebec, M. Cuoq was led to
appear as<br>
an author by his desire to defend his charges against the
injurious<br>
effect of a judgment which had been pronounced by a noted
authority.<br>
M. Renan had put forth, among the many theories which distinguish
his<br>
celebrated work on the Semitic languages, one which seemed to M.
Cuoq as<br>
mischievous as it was unfounded. M. Renan held that no races
were<br>
capable of civilization except such as have now attained it; and
that<br>
these comprised only the Aryan, the Semitic, and the Chinese.
This<br>
opinion was enforced by a reference to the languages spoken by
the<br>
members of those races. "To imagine a barbarous race speaking a
Semitic<br>
or an Indo-European language is," he declares, "an impossible<br>
supposition (<i>une fiction, conradictoire</i>), which no person
can<br>
entertain who is familiar with the laws of comparative philology,
and<br>
with the general theory of the human intellect." To one who
remembers<br>
that every nation of the Indo-European race traces its descent
from a<br>
barbarous ancestry, and especially that the Germans in the days
of<br>
Tacitus were in precisely the same social stage as that of the
Iroquois<br>
in the days of Champlain, this opinion of the brilliant
French<br>
philologist and historian will seem erratic and unaccountable. M.
Cuoq<br>
sought to refute it, not merely by argument, but by the logic
of<br>
facts. In two works, published successively in 1864 and 1866, he
showed,<br>
by many and various examples, that the Iroquois and Algonkin
languages<br>
possessed all the excellences which M. Renan admired in the<br>
Indo-European languages, and surpassed in almost every respect
the<br>
Semitic and Chinese tongues. [Footnote: See <i>Jugement
Erron&eacute; de<br>
M. Ernest Renan sur les Langues Sauvages:</i> (2d edit.)
Dawson<br>
Brothers, Montreal: 1870; and <i>Etudes Philologiques sur
quelques<br>
Langues Sauvages de r Amerique. Par N. O., Ancien
Missionaire</i>. Ibid:<br>
1866. Also <i>Lexique de la Langue Iroquoise, avec notes et<br>
appendices. Par J. A. Cuoq, Pr&eacute;tre de St. Sulpice</i>. J.
Chapleau &amp;<br>
Fils, Montreal: 1882. These are all works indispensable to the
student<br>
of Indian languages.] The resemblances of these Indian languages
to the<br>
Greek struck him, as it had struck his illustrious predecessor,
the<br>
martyred Brebeuf, two hundred years before. M. Cuoq is also the
author<br>
of a valuable Iroquois lexicon, with notes and appendices, in
which he<br>
discusses some interesting points in the philology of the
language. This<br>
lexicon is important, also, for comparison with that of the
Jesuit<br>
missionary, Bruyas, as showing how little the language has varied
in the<br>
course of two centuries. [Footnote: <i>Radices Verborum
Iroquaeorum.<br>
Auctore R. P. Jacopo Bruyas, Societatis Jesu</i>. Published in
Shea's<br>
"<i>Library of American Linguistics</i>" For the works in
this<br>
invaluable Library, American scholars owe a debt of gratitude
to<br>
Dr. Shea's enlightened zeal in the cause of science and
humanity.] The<br>
following particulars respecting the Iroquois tongues are mainly
derived<br>
from the works of M. Cuoq, of Bruyas, and of Mr. Wright,
supplemented<br>
by the researches of the author, pursued at intervals during
several<br>
years, among the tribes of Western Canada and New York. Only a
very<br>
brief sketch of the subject can here be given. It is not too much
to<br>
say that a complete grammar of any Iroquois language would be at
least<br>
as extensive as the best Greek or Sanscrit grammar. For such a
work<br>
neither the writer, nor perhaps any other person now living,
except M.<br>
Cuoq himself, would be competent.</p>

<p>The phonology of the language is at once simple and<br>
perplexing. According to M. Cuoq, twelve letters suffice to
represent<br>
it: <i>a, c, f, h, i, k, n, o, r, s, t, w</i>. Mr. Wright employs
for<br>
the Seneca seventeen, with diacritical marks, which raise the
number to<br>
twenty-one. The English missionaries among the Mohawks found
sixteen<br>
letters sufficient, <i>a, d, e, g, h, i, j, k, n, o, r, s, t, u,
w,<br>
y.</i> There are no labial sounds, unless the <i>f</i>, which
rarely<br>
occurs, and appears to be merely an aspirated <i>w</i>, may
be<br>
considered one. No definite distinction is maintained between the
vowel<br>
sounds <i>o</i> and <i>u</i>, and one of these letters may be
dispensed<br>
with. The distinction between hard and soft (or surd and sonant)
mutes<br>
is not preserved. The sounds of <i>d</i> and <i>t</i>, and those
of<br>
<i>k</i> and <i>g</i>, are interchangeable. So also are those of
<i>l</i><br>
and <i>r</i>, the former sound being heard more frequently in the
Oneida<br>
dialect and the latter in the Canienga. From the Western
dialects,&mdash;the<br>
Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca,&mdash;this <i>l</i> or <i>r</i> sound
has, in<br>
modern times, disappeared altogether. The Canienga
<i>konoronkwa</i>, I<br>
esteem him (in Oneida usually sounded <i>konolonkwa</i>), has
become<br>
<i>konoenkwa</i> in Onondaga,&mdash;and in Cayuga and Seneca is
contracted to<br>
<i>kononkwa</i>. Aspirates and aspirated gutturals abound, and
have<br>
been variously represented by <i>h, hh, kh</i>, and <i>gh</i>,
and<br>
sometimes (in the works of the early French missionaries) by the
Greek<br>
[Greek: chi] and the <i>spiritus asper</i>. Yet no permanent
distinction<br>
appears to be maintained among the sounds thus represented, and
M. Cuoq<br>
reduces them all to the simple <i>h</i>. The French nasal
sound<br>
abounds. M. Cuoq and the earlier English missionaries have
expressed it,<br>
as in French, simply by the <i>n</i> when terminating a syllable.
When<br>
it does not close a syllable, a diaeresis above the n, or else
the<br>
Spanish <i>tilde (n)</i> indicates the sound. Mr. Wright denotes
it by a<br>
line under the vowel. The later English missionaries express it
by a<br>
diphthong: <i>ken</i> becomes <i>kea; nonwa</i> becomes
<i>noewa</i>;<br>
<i>onghwentsya</i> is written <i>oughweatsya</i>.</p>

<p>A strict analysis would probably reduce the sounds of the
Canienga<br>
language to seven consonants, <i>h, k, n, r, s, t,</i> and
<i>w</i>, and<br>
four vowels, <i>a, e, i</i>, and <i>o</i>, of which three, <i>a,
e, and<br>
o</i>, may receive a nasal sound. This nasalizing makes them, in
fact,<br>
distinct elements; and the primary sounds of the language may
therefore<br>
be reckoned at fourteen. [Footnote: A dental <i>t</i>, which the
French<br>
missionaries represent sometimes by the Greek <i>theta</i> and
sometimes<br>
by <i>th</i>, and which the English have also occasionally
expressed by<br>
the latter method, may possibly furnish an additional element.
The Greek<br>
<i>theta</i> of the former is simply the English <i>w</i>.] The
absence<br>
of labials and the frequent aspirated gutturals give to the
utterance of<br>
the best speakers a deep and sonorous character which reminds the
hearer<br>
of the stately Castilian speech.</p>

<p>The "Book of Rites," or, rather, the Canienga portion of it,
is written<br>
in the orthography first employed by the English missionaries.
The<br>
<i>d</i> is frequently used, and must be regarded merely as a
variant of<br>
the <i>t</i> sound. The <i>g</i> is sometimes, though rarely,
employed<br>
as a variant of the <i>k</i>. The digraph <i>gh</i> is common
and<br>
represents the guttural aspirate, which in German is indicated
by<br>
<i>ch</i> and in Spanish by <i>j</i>. The French missionaries
write it<br>
now simply <i>h</i>, and consider it merely a harsh pronunciation
of the<br>
aspirate. The <i>j</i> is sounded as in English; it usually
represents a<br>
complex sound, which might be analysed into <i>ts</i> or
<i>tsi</i>;<br>
<i>jathondek</i> is properly <i>tsiatontek</i>. The <i>x</i>,
which<br>
occasionally appears, is to be pronounced <i>ks</i>, as in<br>
English. <i>An, en, on</i>, when not followed by a vowel, have a
nasal<br>
sound, as in French. This sound is heard even when those
syllables are<br>
followed by another <i>n</i>. Thus <i>Kanonsionni</i> is
pronounced as<br>
if written <i>Kanonsionni</i> and <i>yondennase</i> as if
written<br>
<i>yondennase</i>. The vowels have usually the same sound as in
German<br>
and Italian; but in the nasal <i>en</i> the vowel has an obscure
sound,<br>
nearly like that of the short <i>u</i> in <i>but</i>. Thus<br>
<i>yondennase</i> sounds almost as if written <i>yondunnase</i>,
and<br>
<i>kanienke</i> is pronounced nearly like <i>kaniunke</i>.</p>

<p>The nouns in Iroquois are varied, but with accidence differing
from the<br>
Aryan and Semitic variations, some of the distinctions being
more<br>
subtle, and, so to speak, metaphysical. The dual is expressed
by<br>
prefixing the particle <i>te</i>, and suffixing <i>ke</i> to the
noun;<br>
thus, from <i>kanonsa</i>, house, we have <i>tekanonsake</i>,
two<br>
houses. These syllables, or at least the first, are supposed to
be<br>
derived from <i>tekeni</i>, two. The plural, when it follows
an<br>
adjective expressive of number, is indicated by the syllable
<i>ni</i><br>
prefixed to the noun, and <i>ke</i> suffixed; as, <i>eso<br>
nikanonsake</i>, many houses. In other cases the plural is
sometimes<br>
expressed by one of the words <i>okon</i> (or <i>hokon</i>)<br>
<i>okonha</i>, <i>son</i> and <i>sonha</i>, following the noun.
In<br>
general, however, the plural significance of nouns is left to
be<br>
inferred from the context, the verb always and the adjective
frequently<br>
indicating it.</p>

<p>All beings are divided into two classes, which do not
correspond either<br>
with the Aryan genders or with the distinctions of animate and
inanimate<br>
which prevail in the Algonkin tongues. These classes have been
styled<br>
noble and common. To the noble belong male human beings and<br>
deities. The other class comprises women and all other objects.
It seems<br>
probable, however, that the distinction in the first instance was
merely<br>
that of sex,&mdash;that it was, in fact, a true gender. Deities,
being<br>
regarded as male, were included in the masculine gender. There
being no<br>
neuter form, the feminine gender was extended, and made to
comprise all<br>
other beings. These classes, however, are not indicated by any
change<br>
in the noun, but merely by the forms of the pronoun and the
verb.</p>

<p>The local relations of nouns are expressed by affixed
particles, such as<br>
<i>ke</i>, <i>ne</i>, <i>kon</i>, <i>akon</i>, <i>akta.</i> Thus,
from<br>
<i>on&oacute;nta</i> mountain, we have <i>onont&aacute;ke</i>, at
(or to) the<br>
mountain; from <i>ak&eacute;hrat</i>, dish,
<i>akehr&aacute;tne</i>, in (or on) the<br>
dish; from <i>kan&oacute;nsa</i>, house,
<i>kanons&aacute;kon</i>, or<br>
<i>kan&oacute;nskon</i>, in the house, <i>kanons&oacute;kon</i>,
under the house, and<br>
<i>kanons&aacute;kta</i>, near the house. These locative
particles, it will be<br>
seen, usually, though not always, draw the accent towards
them.</p>

<p>The most peculiar and perplexing variation is that made by
what is<br>
termed the "crement," affixed to many (though not all) nouns.
This<br>
crement in the Canienga takes various forms, <i>ta, sera,
tsera,<br>
kwa.</i> <i>Onkwe</i>, man, becomes <i>onkw&eacute;ta</i>;
<i>otkon</i>,<br>
spirit, <i>otk&oacute;nsera</i>; <i>ak&aacute;we</i>, oar,
<i>akaw&eacute;tsera</i>;<br>
<i>ahta</i>, shoe, <i>ahht&aacute;kwa</i>. The crement is
employed when the noun<br>
is used with numeral adjectives, when it has adjective or other
affixes,<br>
and generally when it enters into composition with other words.
Thus<br>
<i>onkwe</i>, man, combined with the adjective termination
<i>iyo</i><br>
(from the obsolete <i>wiyo</i>, good) becomes <i>onkwetiyo</i>,
good<br>
man. <i>Wenni</i>, day, becomes in the plural <i>niate</i><br>
<i>niwenniserake</i>, many days, etc. The change, however, is
not<br>
grammatical merely, but conveys a peculiar shade of meaning
difficult to<br>
define. The noun, according to M. Cuoq, passes from a general
and<br>
determinate to a special and restricted sense. <i>Onkwe</i> means
man in<br>
general; <i>asen nionkwetake</i>, three men (in particular.)
One<br>
interpreter rendered <i>akaw&eacute;tsera</i>, "the oar itself."
The affix<br>
<i>sera</i> or <i>tsera</i> seems to be employed to form what we
should<br>
term abstract nouns, though to the Iroquois mind they apparently
present<br>
themselves as possessing a restricted or specialized sense. Thus
from<br>
<i>iotarihen</i>, it is warm, we have <i>otarih&eacute;nsera</i>,
heat; from<br>
<i>wakeriat</i>, to be brave, <i>ateriatitsera</i>, courage.
So<br>
<i>kakweni&aacute;tsera</i>, authority; <i>kanai&eacute;sera</i>,
pride;<br>
<i>kanakw&eacute;nsera</i>, anger. Words of this class abound in
the Iroquois;<br>
so little ground is there for the common opinion that the
language is<br>
destitute of abstract nouns. [Footnote: See, on this point, the
remarks<br>
of Dr Brinton to the same effect, in regard to the Aztec,
Qquichua, and<br>
other languages, with interesting illustrations, in his
<i>"American<br>
Hero Myths"</i>, p. 25]</p>

<p>The adjective, when employed in an isolated form, follows
the<br>
substantive; as <i>kanonsa kowa</i>, large house; <i>onkwe
honwe</i> (or<br>
<i>onwe</i>) a real man. But, in general, the substantive and
the<br>
adjective coalesce in one word. <i>Ase</i> signifies new, and
added to<br>
<i>kanonsa</i> gives us <i>kanons&aacute;se</i>, new house.
Karonta, tree, and<br>
<i>kowa</i>, or <i>kowanen</i>, great, make together<br>
<i>karontow&aacute;nen</i>, great tree. Frequently the affixed
adjective is<br>
never employed as an isolated word. The termination <i>iyo</i>
(or<br>
<i>iio</i>) expresses good or beautiful, and <i>aksen</i>, bad or
ugly;<br>
thus <i>kanonsiyo</i>, fine house, <i>kanonsasken</i>, ugly
house. These<br>
compound forms frequently make their plural by adding <i>s</i>,
as<br>
<i>kanonsiyos</i>, <i>kanonsaksens</i>.</p>

<p>The pronouns are more numerous than in any European language,
and show<br>
clearer distinctions in meaning. Thus, in the singular, besides
the<br>
ordinary pronouns, I, thou, he and she, the language possesses
an<br>
indeterminate form, which answers very nearly to the French<br>
<i>on</i>. The first person of the dual has two forms, the
one<br>
including, the other excluding, the person addressed, and
signifying,<br>
therefore, respectively, "thou and I," and "he and I." The first
person<br>
plural has the same twofold form. The third persons dual and
plural have<br>
masculine and feminine forms. Thus the language has fifteen
personal<br>
pronouns, all in common use, and all, it may be added, useful
in<br>
expressing distinctions which the English can only indicate
by<br>
circumlocutions. These pronouns are best shown in the form in
which they<br>
are prefixed to a verb. The following are examples of the
verb<br>
<i>katkahtos</i>, I see (root <i>atkahto</i>) and
<i>kenonwes</i>, I<br>
love (root <i>nonwe</i>), as conjugated in the present
tense:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>katkahtos</i>, I see.<br>
<i>satkahtos</i>, thou seest.<br>
<i>ratkahtos</i>, he sees.<br>
<i>watkahtos</i>, she sees,<br>
<i>iontkahtos</i>, one sees.<br>
<i>tiatkahtos</i>, we two see (thou and I.)<br>
<i>iakiatkahtos</i>, we two see (he and I.)<br>
<i>tsiatkahtos</i>, ye two see.<br>
<i>hiatkahtos</i>, they two see (masc.)<br>
<i>kiatkahtos</i>, they two see (fem.)<br>
<i>tewatkahtos</i>, we see (ye and I.)<br>
<i>iakwatkahtos</i>, we see (they and I.)<br>
<i>sewatkahtos</i>, ye see.<br>
<i>rontkahtos</i>, they see (masc.)<br>
<i>kontkahtos</i>, they see (fem.)</p>

<p><i>kenonwes</i>, I love.<br>
<i>senonwes</i>, thou lovest.<br>
<i>rononwes</i>, he loves.<br>
<i>kanonwes</i>, she loves.<br>
<i>icnonwes</i>, one loves.<br>
<i>teninonwes</i>, we two love (thou and I)<br>
<i>iakeninonwes</i>, we two love (he and I)<br>
<i>seninonwes</i>, ye two love.<br>
<i>hninonwes</i>, they two love (masc.)<br>
<i>keninonwes</i>, they two love (fem.)<br>
<i>tewanonwes</i>, we love (ye and I.)<br>
<i>iakwanonwes</i>, we love (they and I.)<br>
<i>sewanonwes</i>, ye love.<br>
<i>ratinonwes</i>, they love (masc.)<br>
<i>kontinonwes</i>, they love (fem.)</p>

<p>It will be observed that in these examples the prefixed
pronouns differ<br>
considerably in some cases. These differences determine (or
are<br>
determined by) the conjugation of the verbs. <i>Katkahtos</i>
belongs to<br>
the first conjugation, and <i>kenonwes</i> to the second. There
are<br>
three other conjugations, each of which shows some peculiarity in
the<br>
prefixed pronouns, though, in the main, a general resemblance
runs<br>
through them all. There are other variations of the pronouns,
according<br>
to the "paradigm," as it is called, to which the verb belongs. Of
these<br>
paradigms there are two, named in the modern Iroquois grammars
paradigms<br>
K and A, from the first or characteristic letter of the first
personal<br>
pronoun. The particular conjugation and paradigm to which any
verb<br>
belongs can only be learned by practice, or from the
dictionaries.</p>

<p>The same prefixed pronouns are used, with some slight
variations, as<br>
possessives, when prefixed to a substantive; as, from
<i>sita</i>, foot,<br>
we have (in Paradigm A) <i>akasita</i>, my foot, <i>sasita</i>,
thy<br>
foot, <i>raosita</i>, his foot. Thus nouns, like verbs, have the
five<br>
conjugations and the two paradigms.</p>

<p>Iroquois verbs have three moods, indicative, imperative,
and<br>
subjunctive; and they have, in the indicative, seven tenses,
the<br>
present, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect, aorist, future, and
paulo-post<br>
future. These moods and tenses are indicated either by changes
of<br>
termination, or by prefixed particles, or by both conjoined.
One<br>
authority makes six other tenses, but M. Cuoq prefers to include
them<br>
among the special forms of the verb, of which mention will
presently be<br>
made.</p>

<p>To give examples of these tenses, and the rules for their
formation,<br>
would require more space than can be devoted to the subject in
the<br>
present volume. The reader who desires to pursue the study is
referred<br>
to the works of M. Cuoq already mentioned.</p>

<p>The verb takes a passive form by inserting the syllable
<i>at</i><br>
between the prefixed pronoun and the verb; and a reciprocal sense
by<br>
inserting <i>atat</i>. Thus, <i>kiatatas</i>, I put in;<br>
<i>katiatatas</i>, I am put in; <i>katatiatatas</i>, I put myself
in;<br>
<i>konnis</i>, I make; <i>katonnis</i>, I am made;
<i>katatonnis</i>, I<br>
make myself. This syllable <i>at</i> is probably derived from the
word<br>
<i>oyala</i>, body, which is used in the sense of "self," like
the<br>
corresponding word <i>hakty</i> in the Delaware language.</p>

<p>The "transitions," or the pronominal forms which indicate the
passage of<br>
the action of a transitive verb from the agent to the object,
play an<br>
important part in the Iroquois language. In the Algonkin tongues
these<br>
transitions are indicated partly by prefixed pronouns, and partly
by<br>
terminal inflections. In the Iroquois the subjective and
objective<br>
pronouns are both prefixed, as in French. In that language "<i>il
me<br>
voit</i>" corresponds precisely with RAKAthatos, "he-me-sees."
Here the<br>
pronouns, <i>ra</i>, of the third person, and <i>ka</i> of the
first,<br>
are evident enough. In other cases the two pronouns have been
combined<br>
in a form which shows no clear trace of either of the simple
pronouns;<br>
as in <i>helsenonwes</i>, thou lovest him, and <i>hianonwes</i>,
he<br>
loves thee. These combined pronouns are very numerous, and vary,
like<br>
the simple pronouns, in the five conjugations.</p>

<p>The peculiar forms of the verb, analogous to the Semitic
conjugations<br>
are very numerous. Much of the force and richness of the
language<br>
depends on them. M. Caoq enumerates&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The diminutive form, which affixes <i>ha</i>; as
<i>knekirhaHA</i>, I<br>
drink a little; <i>konkweHA</i> (from <i>onkwe</i>, man), I am a
man,<br>
but hardly one (<i>i.e.</i>, I am a little of a man).</p>

<p>2. The augmentative, of which <i>tsi</i> is the affixed sign;
as,<br>
<i>knekirhaTSI</i>, I drink much. This is sometimes lengthened
to<br>
<i>tsihon</i>; as <i>wakatonteTSIHON</i>, I understand
perfectly.</p>

<p>3 and 4. The cislocative, expressing motion towards the
speaker, and the<br>
translocative, indicating motion tending from him. The former
has<br>
<i>t</i>, the latter <i>ie</i> or <i>ia</i>, before the verb,
as<br>
<i>tasataweiat</i>, come in; <i>iasataweiat</i>, go in.</p>

<p>5. The duplicative, which prefixes <i>te</i>, expresses an
action which<br>
affects two or more agents or objects, as in betting, marrying,
joining,<br>
separating. Thus, from <i>ikiaks</i>, I cut, we have
<i>tekiaks</i>, I<br>
cut in two, where the prefix <i>te</i> corresponds to the Latin
bi in<br>
"bisect". The same form is used in speaking of acts done by those
organs<br>
of the body, such as the eyes and the hands, which nature has
made<br>
double. Thus <i>tekasenthos</i>, I weep, is never used except in
this<br>
form.</p>

<p>6 The reiterative is expressed by the sound of <i>s</i>
prefixed to the<br>
verb. It sometimes replaces the cislocative sign; thus,<br>
<i>tkahtenties</i>, I come from yonder; <i>skahtenties</i>, I
come<br>
again.</p>

<p>7. The motional is a form which by some is considered a
special future<br>
tense. Thus, from <i>khiatons</i>, I write, we have
<i>khiatonnes</i>, I<br>
am going to write; from <i>katerios</i>, I fight,
<i>katerioseres</i>, I<br>
am going to the war; from <i>kesaks</i>, I seek, <i>kesakhes</i>,
I am<br>
going to seek. These forms are irregular, and can only be learned
by<br>
practice.</p>

<p>8. The causative suffix is <i>tha</i>; as from
<i>k'kowanen</i>, I am<br>
great, we have <i>k'kowanaTHA</i>, I make great, I aggrandize.
With<br>
<i>at</i> inserted we have a simulative or pretentious form,
as<br>
<i>katkowanaTHA</i>, I make myself great, I pretend to be great.
The<br>
same affix is used to give an instrumental sense; as from<br>
<i>keriios</i>, I kill, we have <i>keriiohTHA</i>, I kill him
with such<br>
a weapon or instrument.</p>

<p>9. The progressive, which ends in <i>tie</i> (sometimes taking
the forms<br>
<i>atie</i>, <i>hatie</i>, <i>tatie</i>), is much used to give
the sense<br>
of becoming, proceeding, continuing, and the like; as<br>
<i>wakhiatontie</i>, I go on writing; <i>wakatrorihatie</i>, I
keep on<br>
talking; <i>wakeriwaientatie</i>, I am attending to the business.
The<br>
addition of an <i>s</i> to this form adds the idea of plurality
or<br>
diversity of acts; thus, <i>wakhiatonties</i>, I go on writing
at<br>
different times and places; <i>wakatrorihaties</i>, I keep on
telling<br>
the thing, <i>i. e.</i>, going from house to house.</p>

<p>10. The attributive has various forms, which can only be
learned by<br>
practice or from the dictionaries. It expresses an action done
for some<br>
other person; as, from <i>wakiote</i>, I work, we have
<i>kiotense</i>,<br>
I work for some one; from <i>katatis</i>, I speak,
<i>katatiase</i>, I<br>
speak in favor of some one.</p>

<p>11. The habitual ends in <i>kon</i>. From <i>katontats</i>, I
hear, I<br>
consent, we have <i>wakatontatskon</i>, I am docile; from<br>
<i>katatis</i>, I speak, <i>wakatatiatskon</i>, I am
talkative.</p>

<p>12. The frequentative has many forms, but usually ends in
<i>on</i>, or<br>
<i>ons</i>. From <i>khiatons</i>, I write, we have in this
form<br>
<i>khiatonnions</i>, I write many things; from <i>katkahtos</i>,
I look,<br>
<i>katkahtonnions</i>, I look on all sides.</p>

<p>These are not all the forms of the Iroquois verb; but enough
have been<br>
enumerated to give some idea of the wealth of the language in
such<br>
derivatives, and the power of varied expression which it derives
from<br>
this source.</p>

<p>The Iroquois has many particles which, like those of the Greek
and<br>
French languages, help to give clearness to the style, though
their<br>
precise meaning cannot always be gathered by one not perfectly
familiar<br>
with the language. <i>Ne</i> and <i>nene</i> are frequently used
as<br>
substitutes for the article and the relative pronouns.
<i>Onenh</i>,<br>
now; <i>kati</i>, then, therefore; <i>ok</i>, <i>nok</i>, and<br>
<i>neok</i>, and; <i>oni</i> and <i>neoni</i>, also; <i>toka</i>
and<br>
<i>tokat</i>, if, perhaps; <i>tsi</i>, when; <i>kento</i>,
here;<br>
<i>akwah</i>, indeed, very; <i>etho</i>, thus, so;
<i>are</i>,<br>
sometimes, again; <i>ken</i>, an interrogative particle, like the
Latin<br>
<i>ne</i>&mdash;these and some others will be found in the Book of
Rites,<br>
employed in the manner in which they are still used by the
best<br>
speakers.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the foregoing sketch affords only
the barest<br>
outline of the formation of the Iroquois language. As has been
before<br>
remarked, a complete grammar of this speech, as full and minute
as the<br>
best Sanscrit or Greek grammars, would probably equal and
perhaps<br>
surpass those grammars in extent. The unconscious forces of
memory and<br>
of discrimination required to maintain this complicated
intellectual<br>
machine, and to preserve it constantly exact and in good working
order,<br>
must be prodigious. Yet a comparison of Bruyas' work with the
language<br>
of the present day shows that this purpose has been accomplished;
and,<br>
what is still more remarkable, a comparison of the Iroquois with
the<br>
Huron grammar shows that after a separation which must have
exceeded<br>
five hundred years, and has probably covered twice that term, the
two<br>
languages differ less from one another than the French of the
twelfth<br>
century differed from the Italian, or than the Anglo-Saxon of
King<br>
Alfred differed from the contemporary Low German speech. The
forms of<br>
the Huron-Iroquois languages, numerous and complicated as they
are,<br>
appear to be certainly not less persistent, and probably
better<br>
maintained, than those of the written Aryan tongues.</p>

ANCIENT RITES OF THE CONDOLING COUNCIL<br>
[*** English Translation]</p>

<p><br>
THE PRELIMINARY CEREMONY:</p>

<p>CALLED, "AT THE WOOD'S EDGE."</p>

<p>1. Now [Footnote: The paragraphs are not numbered in the
original<br>
text. The numbers are prefixed in this work merely for
convenience of<br>
reference.] to-day I have been greatly startled by your voice
coming<br>
through the forest to this opening. You have come with troubled
mind<br>
through all obstacles. You kept seeing the places where they met
on<br>
whom we depended, my offspring. How then can your mind be at
ease? You<br>
kept seeing the footmarks of our forefathers; and all but
perceptible is<br>
the smoke where they used to smoke the pipe together. Can then
your mind<br>
be at ease when you are weeping on your way?</p>

<p>2. Great thanks now, therefore, that you have safely arrived.
Now, then,<br>
let us smoke the pipe together. Because all around are hostile
agencies<br>
which are each thinking, "I will frustrate their purpose." Here
thorny<br>
ways, and here falling trees, and here wild beasts lying in<br>
ambush. Either by these you might have perished, my offspring,
or, here<br>
by floods you might have been destroyed, my offspring, or by
the<br>
uplifted hatchet in the dark outside the house. Every day these
are<br>
wasting us; or deadly invisible disease might have destroyed you,
my<br>
offspring.</p>

<p>3. Great thanks now, therefore, that in safety you have come
through the<br>
forest. Because lamentable would have been the consequences had
you<br>
perished by the way, and the startling word had come, "Yonder are
lying<br>
bodies, yea, and of chiefs!" And they would have thought in
dismay, what<br>
had happened, my offspring.</p>

<p>4. Our forefathers made the rule, and said, "Here they are to
kindle a<br>
fire; here, at the edge of the woods, they are to condole with
each<br>
other in few words." But they have referred thither [Footnote:
That is,<br>
to the Council House.] all business to be duly completed, as well
as for<br>
the mutual embrace of condolence. And they said, "Thither shall
they be<br>
led by the hand, and shall be placed on the principal seat."</p>

<p>5. Now, therefore, you who are our friends of the Wolf
clan:</p>

<p><i>In John Buck's MS.</i> <i>Supposed Meaning.</i><br>
Ka rhe tyon ni.           The broad woods.<br>
Ogh ska wa se ron hon.    Grown up to bushes again.<br>
Gea di yo.                Beautiful plain.<br>
O nen yo deh.             Protruding stone.<br>
De se ro ken.             Between two lines.<br>
Te ho di jen ha ra kwen.  Two families in a long-house,<br>
Ogh re kyon ny.           (Doubtful.) [one at each end.]<br>
Te yo we yen don.         Drooping wings.</p>

<p>Such is the extent of the Wolf clan.</p>

<p>6. Now, then, thy children of the two clans of the
Tortoise:</p>

<p>Ka ne sa da keh.          On the hill side.<br>
Onkwi i ye de.            A person standing there.<br>
Weg'h ke rhon.            (Doubtful.)<br>
Kah ken doh hon.          "<br>
Tho gwen yoh.             "<br>
Kah he kwa ke.            "</p>

<p>Such is the extent of the Tortoise clan.</p>

<p>7. Now these thy brothers of the Bear clan:<br>
  De ya oken. The Forks.<br>
  Jo non de seh. It is a high hill.<br>
  Ots kwe ra ke ron. Dry branches fallen to the ground.<br>
  Ogh na we ron. The springs.</p>

<p>8. Now these have been added lately:<br>
  Ka rho wengh ra don. Taken over the woods.<br>
  Ka ra ken. White.<br>
  De yo he ro. The place of flags (rushes).<br>
  De yo swe ken. Outlet of the river.<br>
  Ox den ke. To the old place.</p>

<p>Such is the extent of the Bear clan.</p>

<p>These were the clans in ancient times.</p>

<p>9. Thus are written the words of mutual greeting, called "the
opening<br>
ceremony." Then one will say, "My offspring, now this day we are
met<br>
together. God has appointed this day. Now, to-day, we are met
together,<br>
on account of the solemn event which has befallen you. Now into
the<br>
earth he has been conveyed to whom we have been wont to look.
Yea,<br>
therefore, in tears let us smoke together."</p>

<p>10. "Now, then, we say, we wipe away the tears, so that in
peace you may<br>
look about you."</p>

<p>11. "And, further, we suppose there is an obstruction in your
ears. Now,<br>
then, we remove the obstruction carefully from your hearing, so
that we<br>
trust you will easily hear the words spoken."</p>

<p>12. "And also we imagine there is an obstruction in your
throat. Now,<br>
therefore, we say, we remove the obstruction, so that you may
speak<br>
freely in our mutual greetings."</p>

<p>13. "Now again another thing, my offspring. I have spoken of
the solemn<br>
event which has befallen you.  Every day you are losing your
great<br>
men. They are being borne into the earth; also the warriors, and
also<br>
your women, and also your grandchildren; so that in the midst of
blood<br>
you are sitting."</p>

<p>14. "Now, therefore, we say, we wash off the bloodmarks from
your seat,<br>
so that it may be for a time that happily the place will be clean
where<br>
you are seated and looking around you."</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>15. Now the Hymn,</p>

<p>  CALLED "HAIL."</p>

<p>  I come again to greet and thank the League;<br>
  I come again to greet and thank the kindred;<br>
  I come again to greet and thank the warriors;<br>
  I come again to greet and thank the women.<br>
  My forefathers,&mdash;what they established,&mdash;<br>
  My forefathers,&mdash;hearken to them!</p>

<p>16. The last verse is sung yet again, while he walks<br>
to and fro in the house, and says:</p>

<p>17. "Hail, my grandsires! Now hearken while your grandchildren
cry<br>
mournfully to you,&mdash;because the Great League which you
established has<br>
grown old. We hope that they may hear."</p>

<p>18. "Hail, my grandsires! You have said that sad will be the
fate of<br>
those who come in the latter times."</p>

<p>19. "Oh, my grandsires! Even now I may have failed to perform
this<br>
ceremony in the order in which they were wont to perform it."
"Oh, my<br>
grandsires! Even now that has become old which you
established,&mdash;the<br>
Great League. You have it as a pillow under your heads in the
ground<br>
where you are lying,&mdash;this Great League which you established;
although<br>
you said that far away in the future the Great League would
endure."</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>So much is to be said here, and the Hymn is to be sung again,
and then<br>
he is to go on and walk about in the house again, saying as
follows:</p>

<p>"Hail, my grandsires! Now hear, therefore, what they did&mdash;all
the rules<br>
they decided on, which they thought would strengthen the House.
Hail, my<br>
grandsires!  this they said: 'Now we have finished; we have
performed<br>
the rites; we have put on the horns.'</p>

<p>"Now again another thing they considered, and this they said:
'Perhaps<br>
this will happen. Scarcely shall we have arrived at home when a
loss<br>
will occur again.' They said, 'This, then, shall be done. As soon
as he<br>
is dead, even then the horns shall be taken off. For if invested
with<br>
horns he should be borne into the grave,' oh, my grandsires, they
said,<br>
'we should perhaps all perish if invested with horns he is
conveyed to<br>
the grave.'</p>

<p>"Then again another thing they determined, oh my grandsires!
'This,'<br>
they said, 'will strengthen the House.' They said, if any one
should be<br>
murdered and [the body] be hidden away among fallen trees by
reason of<br>
the neck being white, then you have said, this shall be done. We
will<br>
place it by the wall in the shade."</p>

<p>25. "Now again you considered and you said: 'It is perhaps not
well that<br>
we leave this here, lest it should be seen by our grandchildren;
for<br>
they are troublesome, prying into every crevice. People will be
startled<br>
at their returning in consternation, and will ask what has
happened that<br>
this (corpse) is lying here; because they will keep on asking
until they<br>
find it out. And they will at once be disturbed in mind, and that
again<br>
will cause us trouble.'"</p>

<p>26. "Now again they decided, and said: 'This shall be done. We
will pull<br>
up a pine tree&mdash;a lofty tree&mdash;and will make a hole through
the<br>
earth-crust, and will drop this thing into a swift current which
will<br>
carry it out of sight, and then never will our grandchildren see
it<br>
again.'"</p>

<p>27. "Now again another thing they decided, and thought, this
will<br>
strengthen the House. They said: 'Now we have finished; we
have<br>
performed the rites. Perhaps presently it will happen that a loss
will<br>
occur amongst us. Then this shall be done. We will suspend a
pouch upon<br>
a pole, and will place in it some mourning wampum&mdash;some short<br>
strings&mdash;to be taken to the place where the loss was suffered.
The<br>
bearer will enter, and will stand by the hearth, and will speak a
few<br>
words to comfort those who will be mourning; and then they will
be<br>
comforted, and will conform to the great law.'"</p>

<p>28. "Now, then, thou wert the principal of this
Confederacy,<br>
Dekanawidah, with the joint principal, his son, Odadsheghte; and
then<br>
again <i>his</i> uncle, Wathadodarho; and also again <i>his</i>
son,<br>
Akahenyonh; and again <i>his</i> uncle, Kanyadariyu; and then
again<br>
<i>his</i> cousin, Shadekaronyes; and then in later times
additions were<br>
made to the great edifice."</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>29. Now listen, ye who established the Great League. Now it
has become<br>
old. Now there is nothing but wilderness. Ye are in your graves
who<br>
established it. Ye have taken it with you, and have placed it
under you,<br>
and there is nothing left but a desert. There ye have taken
your<br>
intellects with you. What ye established ye have taken with you.
Ye have<br>
placed under your heads what ye established&mdash;the Great
League.</p>

<p>30. Now, then, hearken, ye who were rulers and founders:

<p>THE BOOK OF THE YOUNGER NATIONS.</p>

<p>(TRANSLATION.)</p>

<p>I. a. Now&mdash;now this day&mdash;now I come to your door where you are
mourning<br>
in great darkness, prostrate with grief. For this reason we have
come<br>
here to mourn with you. I will enter your door, and come before
the<br>
ashes, and mourn with you there; and I will speak these words to
comfort<br>
you.</p>

<p>I. b. Now our uncle has passed away, he who used to work for
all, that<br>
they might see the brighter days to come,&mdash;for the whole body
of<br>
warriors and also for the whole body of women, and also the
children<br>
that were running around, and also for the little ones creeping
on the<br>
ground, and also those that are tied to the cradle-boards; for
all these<br>
he used to work that they might see the bright days to come. This
we<br>
say, we three brothers.</p>

<p>I. c. Now the ancient lawgivers have declared&mdash;our uncles that
are gone,<br>
and also our elder brothers&mdash;they have said, it is worth
twenty&mdash;it was<br>
valued at twenty&mdash;and this was the price of the one who is dead.
And we<br>
put our words on it (<i>i.e.</i> the wampum), and they recall
his<br>
name&mdash;the one that is dead. This we say and do, we three
brothers.</p>

<p>I. d. Now there is another thing we say, we younger brothers.
He who has<br>
worked for us has gone afar off; and he also will in time take
with him<br>
all these&mdash;the whole body of warriors and also the whole body
of<br>
women&mdash;they will go with him. Rut it is still harder when the
woman<br>
shall die, because with her the line is lost. And also the
grandchildren<br>
and the little ones who are running aruund&mdash;these he will take
away; and<br>
also those that are creeping on the ground, and also those that
are on<br>
the cradle-boards; all these he will takeaway with him.</p>

<p>1. e. Now then another thing we will say, we three brothers.
Now you<br>
must feel for us; for we came here of our own good-will&mdash;came to
your<br>
door that we might say this. And we will say that we will try to
do you<br>
good. When the grave has been made, we will make it still better.
We<br>
will adorn it, and cover it with moss. We will do this, we
three<br>
brothers.</p>

<p>2. Now another thing we will say, we younger brothers. You are
mourning<br>
in the deep darkness. I will make the sky clear for you, so that
you<br>
will not see a cloud. And also I will give the sun to shine upon
you, so<br>
that you can look upon it peacefully when it goes down: You shall
see it<br>
when it is going. Yea! the sun shall seem to be hanging just over
you,<br>
and you shall look upon it peacefully as it goes down. Now I have
hope<br>
that you will yet see the pleasant days. This we say and do, we
three<br>
brothers.</p>

<p>3. Now then another thing we say, we younger brothers. Now we
will open<br>
your ears, and also your throat, for there is something that has
been<br>
choking you and we will also give you the water that shall wash
down all<br>
the troubles in your throat. We shall hope that after this your
mind<br>
will recover its cheerfulness. This we say and do, we three
brothers.</p>

<p>4. Now then there is another thing we say, we younger
brothers. We will<br>
now remake the fire, and cause it to burn again. And now you can
go out<br>
before the people, and go on with your duties and your labors for
the<br>
people. This we say and do, we three brothers.</p>

<p>5. Now also another thing we say, we younger brothers. You
must<br>
converse with your nephews; and if they say what is good, you
must<br>
listen to it. Do not cast it aside. And also if the warriors
should say<br>
anything that is good, do not reject it. This we say, we three
brothers.</p>

<p>6. Now then another thing we say, we younger brothers. If any
one<br>
should fall&mdash;it may be a principal chief will fall and descend
into the<br>
grave&mdash;then the horns shall be left on the grave, and as soon
as<br>
possible another shall be put in his place. This we say, we
three<br>
brothers.</p>

<p>7. Now another thing we say, we younger brothers. We will gird
the belt<br>
on you, with the pouch, and the next death will receive the
pouch,<br>
whenever you shall know that there is death among us, when the
fire is<br>
made and the smoke is rising. This we say and do, we three
brothers.</p>

<p>7. b. Now I have finished. Now show me the man! [Footnote:
<i>i. e.</i>,<br>
"Point out to me the man whom I am to proclaim as chief, in place
of the<br>
deceased."]</p>

<p>NOTES ON THE CANIENGA BOOK</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>The meaning of the general title, <i>Okayondonghsera
Yondennase</i>, has<br>
been already explained (Introduction, p. 48). In the sub-title,
the word<br>
<i>oghentonh</i> is properly an adverb, meaning firstly, or<br>
foremost. This title might be literally rendered. "First the
ceremony,<br>
'At-the-wood's-edge' they call it."</p>

<p>1. The chiefs, in their journey to the place of meeting, are
supposed to<br>
have passed the sites of many deserted towns, in which councils
had<br>
formerly been held. Owing to the frequent removals of their
villages,<br>
such deserted sites were common in the Iroquois country. The
speaker who<br>
welcomes the arriving guests supposes that the view of these
places had<br>
awakened in their minds mournful recollections.</p>

<p><i>Desawennawenrate</i>, "thy voice coming over." This word is
explained<br>
in the Glossary. It is in the singular number. According to the
Indian<br>
custom, the speaker regards himself as representing the whole
party for<br>
whom he speaks, and he addresses the leader of the other party as
the<br>
representative and embodiment of all who come with him.
Throughout the<br>
speeches "I" and "thou" are used in the well understood sense of
"we"<br>
and "ye." In like manner, tribes and nations are, as it were,<br>
personified. A chief, speaking for the Onondagas, will say, "I
(that is,<br>
my nation) am angry; thou (the Delaware people) hast done wrong."
This<br>
style of bold personification is common in the scriptures. Moses
warns<br>
the Israelites: "Thou art a stiff-necked people." "Oh my
people!"<br>
exclaims Isaiah; "they which lead thee cause thee to err."</p>

<p>2. <i>Denighroghkwayen</i>, "let us two smoke." This word is
in the dual<br>
number, the two parties, the hosts and the guests, being each
regarded<br>
as one individual.</p>

<p>The difficulties and dangers which in the early days of the
confederacy<br>
beset the traveler in threading his way through the forest, from
one<br>
Indian nation to another, are vividly described in this section.
The<br>
words are still employed by their speakers as an established
form,<br>
though they have ceased to have any pertinence to their
present<br>
circumstances.</p>

<p>3. <i>Alnuah deyakonakarondon</i>, "yea, of
chiefs,"&mdash;literally, "yea,<br>
having horns." The custom of wearing horns as part of the
head-dress of<br>
a chief has been long disused among the Iroquois; but the idiom
remains<br>
in the language, and the horns, in common parlance, indicate the
chief,<br>
as the coronet suggests the nobleman in England. Among the
western<br>
Indians, as is well known, the usage still survives. "No one,"
says<br>
Catlin, "wears the head-dress surmounted with horns except
the<br>
dignitaries who are very high in authority, and whose exceeding
valor,<br>
worth, and power are admitted by all." These insignia of rank
are, he<br>
adds, only worn on special and rare occasions, as in meeting
embassies,<br>
or at warlike parades or other public festivals, or sometimes
when a<br>
chief sees fit to lead a war-party to battle. [Footnote:
<i>Letters and<br>
Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Condition of the North
American<br>
Indians.</i> By George Catlin; p. 172.] The origin of the custom
is<br>
readily understood. The sight, frequent enough in former days, of
an<br>
antlered stag leading a herd of deer would be quite sufficient
to<br>
suggest to the quick apprehension of the Indian this emblem of
authority<br>
and pre-eminence.</p>

<p>5. <i>Sathaghyortnighson</i>, "thou who art of the Wolf clan."
 The clan<br>
is addressed in the singular number, as one person. It is
deserving of<br>
notice that the titles of clan-ship used in the language of
ceremony are<br>
not derived from the ordinary names of the animals which give the
clans<br>
their designations. <i>Okwatho</i> is wolf, but a man of the Wolf
clan<br>
is called <i>Tahionni</i>,&mdash;or, as written in the text,<br>
<i>Taghyonni</i>. In ordinary speech, however, the expression<br>
<i>rokwaho</i>, "he is a Wolf," might be used.</p>

<p>The English renderings of the names in the list of towns are
those which<br>
the interpreters finally decided upon. In several instances they
doubted<br>
about the meaning, and in some cases they could not suggest
an<br>
explanation. Either the words are obsolete, or they have come
down in<br>
such a corrupt form that their original elements and purport
cannot be<br>
determined. As regards the sites of the towns, see the Appendix,
Note E.</p>

<p>6. <i>Deyako-larakeh ranyaghdenghshon</i>,&mdash;"the two clans of
the<br>
Tortoise." Respecting the two sub-gentes into which the Tortoise
clan<br>
was divided, see <i>ante</i>, p. 53. <i>Anowara</i> is the word
for<br>
tortoise, but <i>raniahten</i> (or, in the orthography of the
text,<br>
<i>ranyaghdengh</i>) signifies, "he is of the Tortoise clan."</p>

<p>7. <i>Jadadeken roskerewake</i>, "thy brother of the Bear
clan."<br>
<i>Okwari</i> is bear, but <i>roskerewake</i> signifies "he is of
the<br>
Bear clan." <i>Rokwari</i>, "he is a Bear," might, however, be
used with<br>
the same meaning.</p>

<p>8. <i>Onghwa kehaghshonha</i>, "now recently." It is possible
that<br>
<i>onghwa</i> is here written by mistake for <i>orighwa</i>. The
word<br>
<i>orighwakayongh</i>, which immediately follows, signifies "in
ancient<br>
times," and the corresponding word <i>orighwake-haghshonha</i>
would be<br>
"in younger times." The period in which these additions were
made,<br>
though styled recent, was probably long past when the "Book of
Rites"<br>
was committed to writing; otherwise many towns which are known to
have<br>
existed at the latter date would have been added to the list. In
fact,<br>
the words with which the catalogue of towns closes&mdash;"these were
the<br>
clans in ancient times,"&mdash;seem to refer these later additions,
along<br>
with the rest, back to a primitive era of the confederacy.</p>

<p>9. <i>Rawenniyo raweghniseronnyh</i>, "God has appointed this
day," or,<br>
literally, "God makes this day." In these words are probably
found the<br>
only trace of any modification of the Book of Rites caused by
the<br>
influence of the white visitors and teachers of the modern
Iroquois. As<br>
the very fact that the book was written in the alphabet
introduced by<br>
the missionaries makes us certain that the person who reduced it
to<br>
writing had been under missionary instruction, it might be
deemed<br>
surprising that more evidences of this influence are not
apparent. It is<br>
probable, however, that the conservative feeling of the Council
would<br>
have rejected any serious alterations in their ancient forms. It
seems<br>
not unlikely that David of Schoharie&mdash;or whoever was the penman
on this<br>
occasion&mdash;may have submitted his work to his missionary teacher,
and<br>
that in deference to his suggestion a single interpolation of
a<br>
religious cast, to which no particular objection could be made,
was<br>
allowed to pass.</p>

<p>The word <i>Rawenniyo</i>, as is well known, is the term for
God which<br>
was adopted by the Catholic missionaries. It is, indeed, of<br>
Huron-Iroquois origin, and may doubtless have been occasionally
employed<br>
from the earliest times as an epithet proper for a great
divinity. Its<br>
origin and precise meaning are explained in the Appendix, Note B.
The<br>
Catholic missionaries appropriated it as the special name of the
Deity,<br>
and its use in later times is probably to be regarded as an
evidence of<br>
Christian influence. That the sentence in which it occurs in the
text is<br>
probably an interpolation, is shown by the fact that the words
which<br>
precede this sentence are repeated, with a slight change,
immediately<br>
after it. Having interjected this pious expression, the writer
seems to<br>
have thought it necessary to resume the thread of the discourse
by going<br>
back to the phrase which had preceded it. It will be observed
that the<br>
religious sentiment proper to the Book of Rites appears to us
confined<br>
to expressions of reverence for the great departed, the founders
of the<br>
commonwealth. This circumstance, however should not be regarded
as<br>
indicating that the people were devoid of devotional feeling of
another<br>
kind. Their frequent "thanksgiving festivals" afford sufficient
evidence<br>
of the strength of this sentiment; but they apparently considered
its<br>
display out of place in their political acts.</p>

<p>15. <i>Nene karcnna</i>, "the song," or "hymn." The purport of
this<br>
composition is explained in the Introduction (<i>ante</i>,<br>
p. 62). Before the Book of Rites came into my possession I had
often<br>
heard the hymn repeated, or sung, by different individuals, in
slightly<br>
varying forms. The Onondaga version, given me on the Syracuse<br>
Reservation, contains a line, "<i>Negwiyage teskenonhenhne</i>"
which is<br>
not found in the Canienga MS. It is rendered "I come to greet
the<br>
children." The affection of the Indians for their children, which
is<br>
exhibited in various passages of the Book, is most apparent in
the<br>
Onondaga portion.</p>

<p><i>Kayanerenh</i>. This word is variously rendered,&mdash;"the
peace," "the<br>
law," and "the league," (see <i>ante</i>, p. 33). Here it
evidently<br>
stands for <i>Kayancrenhkowa</i>, "the Great Peace," which is the
name<br>
usually given by the Kanonsionni to their league, or federal<br>
constitution.</p>

<p><i>Deskenonghweronne</i>, or in the modern French
orthography,<br>
<i>teskenonhweronne</i>, "we come to greet and thank," is a good
example<br>
of the comprehensive force of the Iroquois tongue. Its root
is<br>
<i>nonhwe</i>, or <i>nanwe</i>, which is found in
<i>kenonhws</i>, I<br>
love, like, am pleased with&mdash;the initial syllable <i>ke</i> being
the<br>
first personal pronoun. In the frequentative form this
becomes<br>
<i>kenonhweron</i>, which has the meaning of "I salute and
thank," i.e.,<br>
I manifest by repeated acts my liking or gratification. The
<i>s</i><br>
prefixed to this word is the sign of the reiterative form:<br>
<i>skenonhweron</i>, "<i>again</i> I greet and thank."  The
terminal<br>
syllable <i>ne</i> and the prefixed <i>te</i> are respectively
the signs<br>
of the motional and the cislocative forms,&mdash;"I <i>come hither</i>
again<br>
to greet and thank." A word of six syllables, easily pronounced
(and in<br>
the Onondaga dialect reduced to five) expresses fully and
forcibly the<br>
meaning for which eight not very euphonious English words are<br>
required. The notion that the existence of these comprehensive
words in<br>
an Indian language, or any other, is an evidence of deficiency
in<br>
analytic power, is a fallacy which was long ago exposed by the
clear and<br>
penetrative reasoning of Duponceau, the true father of
American<br>
philology. [Footnote: See the admirable Preface to his
translation of<br>
Zeisberger's Delaware Grammar, p. 94.] As he has well
explained,<br>
analysis must precede synthesis. In fact, the power of what may
be<br>
termed analytic synthesis,&mdash;the mental power which first resolves
words<br>
or things into their elements, and then puts them together in
new<br>
forms,&mdash;is a creative or co-ordinating force, indicative of a
higher<br>
natural capacity than the act of mere analysis. The genius which
framed<br>
the word <i>teskenonhweronne</i> is the same that, working with
other<br>
elements, produced the steam-engine and the telephone.</p>

<p><i>Ronkeghsota jivathondek</i>. Two translations of this verse
were<br>
given by different interpreters. One made it an address to the
people:<br>
"My forefathers&mdash;hearken to them!" i.e., listen to the words of
our<br>
forefathers, which I am about to repeat. The other considered the
verse<br>
an invocation to the ancestors themselves. "My forefathers!
hearken ye!"<br>
The words will bear either rendering, and either will be
consonant with<br>
the speeches which follow.</p>

<p>The lines of this hymn have been thus cast into the metre
of<br>
Longfellow's "Hiawatha:"&mdash;</p>

<p> "To the great Peace bring we greeting!<br>
  To the dead chiefs kindred, greeting!<br>
  To the warriors round him, greeting!<br>
  To the mourning women, greeting!<br>
  These our grandsires' words repeating,<br>
  Graciously, O grandsires, hear us!"</p>

<p>16. <i>Enyonghdentyonko kanonghsakonghshen</i>,-"he will walk
to and fro<br>
in the house." In councils and formal receptions it is customary
for the<br>
orator to walk slowly to and fro during the intervals of his<br>
speech. Sometimes, before beginning his address, he makes a
circuit of<br>
the assembly with a meditative aspect, as if collecting his<br>
thoughts. All public acts of the Indians are marked with some
sign of<br>
deliberation.</p>

<p>21. <i>Eghnikonh enyerighwawetharho kenthoh</i>,&mdash;"thus they
will close<br>
the ceremony here." The address to the forefathers, which is
mainly an<br>
outburst of lamentation over the degeneracy of the times, is
here<br>
concluded. It would seem, from what follows, that at this point
the<br>
candidate for senatorial honors is presented to the council, and
is<br>
formally received among them, with the usual ceremonies, which
were too<br>
well known to need description. The hymn is then sung again, and
the<br>
orator proceeds to recite the ancient laws which the founders of
their<br>
confederacy established.</p>

<p>22. <i>Watidewennakarondonnyon</i>, "we have put on the
horns;" in other<br>
words, "we have invested the new chief with the ensigns of
office,"&mdash;or,<br>
more briefly, "we have installed him." The latter is the meaning
as at<br>
present understood; but it is probable that, in earlier days,
the<br>
panoply of horns was really placed on the head of the newly
inducted<br>
councillor.</p>

<p>23. <i>Aghsonh denvakokwanentonghsacke</i>, etc., "as soon as
he is dead"<br>
(or, according to another rendering, "when he is just dying") the
horns<br>
shall be taken off. The purport and object of this law are set
forth in<br>
the Introduction, p.67.</p>

<p>24. <i>Ne nayakoghstonde ne nayeghnyasakenradake, "by reason
of the neck<br>
being white." The law prescribed in this section to govern
the<br>
proceedings of the Council in the case of homicide has been
explained in<br>
the Introduction, p. 68. The words now quoted, however, introduce
a<br>
perplexity which cannot be satisfactorily cleared up. The aged
chief,<br>
John S. Johnson, when asked their meaning, was only able to say
that<br>
neither he nor his fellow councillors fully understood it. They
repeated<br>
in council the words as they were written in the book, but in
this case,<br>
as in some others, they were not sure of the precise significance
or<br>
purpose of what they said. Some of them thought that their
ancestors,<br>
the founders, had foreseen the coming of the white people, and
wished to<br>
advise their successors against quarreling with their future<br>
neighbors. If this injunction was really implied in the words, we
must<br>
suppose that they were an interpolation of the Christian chief,
David of<br>
Schoharie, or possibly of his friend Brant. They do not, however,
seem<br>
to be, by any means, well adapted to convey this meaning. The<br>
probability is that they are a modern corruption of some earlier
phrase,<br>
whose meaning had become obsolete. They are repeated by the
chiefs in<br>
council, as some antiquated words in the authorized version of
the<br>
scriptures are read in our own churches, with no clear<br>
comprehension&mdash;perhaps with a total misconception&mdash;of their
original<br>
sense.</i></p>

<p><i>27. Enjonkwanekheren, "we shall lose some one," or,
more<br>
literally, we shall fail to know some person. This law, which is
fully<br>
explained in the Introduction, p. 70, will be found aptly
exemplified in<br>
the Onondaga portion of the text, where the speeches of the
"younger<br>
brothers" are evidently framed in strict compliance with the
injunctions<br>
here given.</i></p>

<p>28. <i>Jadakweniyu</i>. This word, usually rendered "ruler,"
appears to<br>
mean "principal person," or perhaps originally a "very powerful
person."<br>
It is a compound word, formed apparently from <i>oyata</i>, body
or<br>
person, <i>kakwennion</i>, to be able, and the adjective
termination<br>
<i>iyu</i> or <i>iyo</i>, in its original sense of "great."
(See<br>
Appendix, Note B.) M. Cuoq, in his Iroquois Lexicon, defines the
verb<br>
<i>kiatakwenniyo</i> as meaning "to be the important personage,
the<br>
first, the principal, the president." It corresponds very nearly
to the<br>
Latin <i>princeps</i>, and, as applied in the following litany to
the<br>
fifty great hereditary chiefs of the Iroquois, might fairly
enough be<br>
rendered "prince."</p>

<p><i>Kanonghsyonny</i>, in modern orthography,
<i>Kanonsionni</i>. For the<br>
origin and meaning of this word, and an explanation of the
following<br>
section, see the Introduction, p. 75.</p>

<p><i>Yejodenaghstahhere kanaghsdajikowah</i>, lit., "they
added<br>
frame-poles to the great framework." Each of these compounds
comprises<br>
the word <i>kanaghsta</i>, which is spelt by Bruyas,
<i>gannasta</i>,<br>
and defined by him, "poles for making a cabin,&mdash;the inner one,
which is<br>
bent to form the frame of a cabin." The reference in these words
is to<br>
the Tuscaroras, Tuteloes, Nanticokes, and other tribes, who
were<br>
admitted into the confederacy after its first formation. From
a<br>
manuscript book, written in the Onondaga dialect, which I found
at<br>
"Onondaga Castle," in September, 1880, I copied a list of the
fifty<br>
councillors, which closed with the words, "<i>shotinastasonta<br>
kanastajikona Ontaskaeken</i>"&mdash;literally, "they added a
frame-pole to<br>
the great framework, the Tuscarora nation."</p>

<p>29. <i>Onenh jathondek, sewarihwisaanonghkwe
Kayanerenghkowa,&mdash;</i>"now<br>
listen, ye who completed the work, the Great League." This
section,<br>
though written continuously as prose, was probably always sung,
like the<br>
list of chiefs which follows. It is, in fact, the commencement of
a<br>
great historical chant, similar in character to the 78th Psalm,
or to<br>
some passages of the Prophets, which in style it greatly
resembles. In<br>
singing this portion, as also in the following litany to the
chiefs, the<br>
long-drawn exclamation of <i>hai</i>, or <i>haihhaih</i>, is
frequently<br>
introduced. In the MS. book referred to in the last note, the
list of<br>
councillors was preceded by a paragraph, written like prose, but
with<br>
many of these interjections interspersed through it. The
interpreter,<br>
Albert Cusick, an intelligent and educated man, assured me that
this was<br>
a song, and at my request he chanted a few staves of it, after
the<br>
native fashion. The following are the words of this hymn,
arranged as<br>
they are sung. It will be seen that it is a sort of cento or<br>
compilation, in the Onondaga dialect, of passages from various
portions<br>
of the Canienga Book of Rites, and chiefly from the section (29)
now<br>
under consideration:&mdash;</p>

<p>   <i>Haihhaih!</i>              Woe! Woe!<br>
  <i>Jiyathonick!</i>            Hearken ye!<br>
  <i>Xivonkliti!</i>             We are diminished!<br>
   <i>Haihhaih!</i>              Woe! Woe!<br>
  <i>Tejoskawayenton.</i>        The cleared land has become a
thicket.<br>
   <i>Haihhaih!</i>             Woe! Woe!<br>
  <i>Skakentahenyon.</i>         The clear places are
deserted.<br>
   <i>Hai!</i>                   Woe!<br>
  <i>Shatyherarta&mdash;</i>          They are in their graves&mdash;<br>
  <i>Hotyiwisahongwe&mdash;</i>       They who established it&mdash;<br>
   <i>Hai!</i>                   Woe!<br>
  <i>Kayaneengoha.</i>           The great League.<br>
  <i>Netikenen honen</i>         Yet they declared<br>
  <i>Nene kenyoiwatatye&mdash;</i>    It should endure&mdash;<br>
  <i>Kayaneengowane.</i>         The great League.<br>
   <i>Hai!</i>                   Woe!<br>
  <i>Wakaiwakayonnheha.</i>      Their work has grown old.<br>
   <i>Hai!</i>                   Woe!<br>
  <i>Netho watyongwententhe.</i> Thus we are become
miserable.</p>

<p>The closing word is the same as the Canienga
<i>watyonkwentendane</i>,<br>
which is found in the closing section of the Canienga book. The
lines of<br>
the Onondaga hymn which immediately precede this concluding word
will be<br>
found in Section 20 of that book, a section which is probably
meant to<br>
be chanted. It will be noticed that the lines of this hymn
fall<br>
naturally into a sort of parallelism, like that of the Hebrew
chants.</p>

<p>30. <i>Dekarihaokenh</i>, or <i>Tehkarihhoken</i>. In John
Buck's MS.<br>
the list of chiefs is preceded by the words "<i>Nene
Tehadirihoken</i>,"<br>
meaning the Caniengas, or, literally, "the Tekarihokens."  For
an<br>
explanation of this idiom and name, see <i>ante</i>, p. 77.</p>

<p><i>Ayonhwahtha</i>, or <i>Hayeirwatha</i>. This name, which,
as<br>
Hiawatha, is now familiar to us as a household word, is rendered
"He who<br>
seeks the wampum belt." Chief George Johnson thought it was
derived from<br>
<i>oyonwa</i>, wampum-belt, and <i>ratiehwatha</i>, to look
for<br>
something, or, rather, to seem to seek something which we know
where to<br>
find. M. Cuoq refe/s the latter part of the word to the verb<br>
<i>katha</i>, to make. [Footnote: Lexique de la Langue
Iroquois,<br>
p. 161] The termination <i>atha</i> is, in this sense, of
frequent<br>
occurrence in Iroquois compounds. The name would then mean "He
who makes<br>
the wampum-belt," and would account for the story which ascribes
to<br>
Hiawatha the invention of wampum. The Senecas, in whose language
the<br>
word <i>oyonwa</i> has ceased to exist, have corrupted the name
to<br>
<i>Hayowentha</i>, which they render "he who combs." This form of
the<br>
name has also produced its legend, which is referred to
elsewhere<br>
(p. 87). Hiawatha "combed the snakes out of Atotarho's head,"
when he<br>
brought that redoubted chief into the confederacy.</p>

<p><i>Shatekariwalf</i>, "two equal statements," or "two things
equal."<br>
This name is derived-from <i>sate</i> or <i>shate</i>, equal,
and<br>
<i>kariwa</i>, or <i>karihwa</i>, for which see the Glossary.</p>

<p><i>Etho natejonhne</i>, "this was your number," or, this was
the extent<br>
of your class. These words, or the similar form, <i>etho<br>
natehadinhne</i>, "this was their number," indicate apparently
that the<br>
roll of chiefs belonging to a particular class or clan is<br>
completed. They are followed by three other words which have
been<br>
already explained (<i>ante</i>, pages 33 and 80),<br>
<i>sewater-ihwakhaonghkwe, sewarihwisaanonghkwe,
kayanerenhkowa</i>. In<br>
the written litany these three words are omitted toward the<br>
close,&mdash;probably to save the penman the labor of transcription;
but in<br>
the actual ceremony it is understood that they are chanted
wherever the<br>
formula <i>etho natejonhne</i>, or <i>etho natchadinhne</i>,
occurs. In<br>
the modern Canienga speech this verb is thus conjugated in
the<br>
plural,&mdash;<i>etho</i> being contracted to <i>eh</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>  <i>ehnatetionhne</i>,  we were that number;<br>
  <i>ehnatejionhne</i>,  ye were that number;<br>
  <i>ehnatehadinhne</i>, they were that number.</p>

<p>The three Canienga councillors of the first class all belong
to the<br>
Tortoise clan.</p>

<p>31. <i>Sharenhowane</i>; in Onondaga, Showenhona. This name
was<br>
translated by the interpreters, "he is the loftiest tree."  It
seems<br>
properly to mean "he is a great tree-top," from <i>karenha</i>,
or<br>
<i>garenha</i>, which Bruyas renders <i>cime d'arbre</i>, and<br>
<i>kowane</i>, great.</p>

<p><i>Deyonnhehgonh</i>, or <i>Teyonhehkwen</i>, "double life,"
from<br>
<i>onnhe</i>, life. My friend, Chief George Johnson, who bears
this<br>
titular appellation, tells me that it is properly the name of a
certain<br>
shrub, which has a great tenacity of life.</p>

<p><i>Ohrenregowah</i>; in Onondaga, <i>Owenhegona</i>. The
interpreters<br>
differed much in opinion as to the meaning of this name. Some
said "wide<br>
branches;" another, "a high hill."  The root-word,
<i>ohrenre</i>, is<br>
obsolete, and its meaning is apparently lost.</p>

<p>The three chiefs of the second class or division of the
Caniengas belong<br>
to the Wolf clan.</p>

<p>32. <i>Dehennakarine</i>; in Onondaga, <i>Tehennakaihne</i>;
"going with<br>
two horns." The root is <i>onakara</i>, horn; the termination<br>
<i>ine</i>, or <i>ihne</i>, gives the sense of going; <i>de</i>
or<br>
<i>te</i> is the duplicative prefix.</p>

<p><i>Aghstawenserontha</i> (Onon. <i>Hastawensenwa</i>), "he
puts on the<br>
rattles." Mr. Bearfoot writes, "<i>Ohstawensera</i> seems to have
been a<br>
general name for anything denuded of flesh, but is now confined
to the<br>
rattles of the rattlesnake."</p>

<p><i>Shosgoharowane</i> (Onon. <i>Shosgohaehna</i>), "he is a
great<br>
wood-drift." "<i>Yohskoharo</i>, writes Mr. Bearfoot, means
an<br>
obstruction by driftwood in creeks or small rivers."</p>

<p>The councillors of the third Canienga class are of the Bear
clan.</p>

<p>33. <i>Ise seniyatagweniyohkwe</i>, "ye two were the
principals."<br>
<i>Atagweniyo</i>, or <i>adakweniyu</i>(see <i>ante</i>, note to
Sec. 28)<br>
here becomes a verb in the imperfect tense and the dual number.
The<br>
reference is either to Dekanawidah and Odatsehte, the chiefs of
the<br>
Caniengas and Oneidas, who worked together in founding the
confederacy,<br>
or, rather, perhaps, to their two nations, each regarded as
an<br>
individual, and, in a manner, personified.</p>

<p><i>Jatatawhak</i>, or, more properly <i>jatatahwak</i>,
means,<br>
literally, "son of each other." It is from the root-word
<i>kaha-wak</i><br>
(or <i>gahawak</i>), which is defined by Bruyas, <i>avoir
pour<br>
enfant</i>, and is in the reciprocal form. Here, however, it
is<br>
understood to mean "father and son," in reference to the
political<br>
relationship between the Canienga and Oneida nations.</p>

<p><i>Odatsehte</i> (Onon., Tatshehte), "bearing a quiver,"&mdash;or
the pouch<br>
in which the arrows are carried. According to the tradition,
when<br>
Dekanawidah's brother and ambassador formally adopted
<i>Odatsehte</i><br>
as the political son of the Canienga chief, he took the quiver
off his<br>
own shoulder, and hung it upon that of the Oneida chieftain.</p>

<p><i>Kanonhgwenyodon</i>, "setting up ears of corn in a row."
 From<br>
<i>ononhkwenha</i>, an ear of corn.</p>

<p><i>Deyohhagwente</i> (Onon., <i>Tyohagwente</i>), "open voice"
(?)  This<br>
is another obsolete, or semi-obsolete word, about which the
interpreters<br>
differ widely in opinion. "Hollow tube," "windpipe," "opening in
the<br>
woods," "open voice," were the various renderings suggested. The
latter<br>
would be derived from <i>ohakwa</i> or <i>ohagwa</i>, voice, and
the<br>
termination <i>wente</i> or <i>gwente</i>, which gives the sense
of<br>
"open."</p>

<p>The three chiefs of the first Oneida class belong to the Wolf
clan.</p>

<p>34. <i>Shononhsese</i> (Onon., Shononses), "his long house."
or, "he has<br>
a long house." From <i>kanonsa</i>, house, with the adjective<br>
termination <i>es</i>, long.</p>

<p><i>Daonahrokenagh</i> (Onon., Tonaohgena), "two branches."
 This is<br>
another doubtful word. In modern Canienga, "two branches" would
be<br>
<i>Tonenroken</i>.</p>

<p><i>Atyatonentha</i> (Onon., Hatyatonnentha), "he lowers
himself," or,<br>
literally, "he slides himself down," from <i>oyata</i>, body,
self, and<br>
<i>tonnenta</i>, to slide.</p>

<p>The councillors of the second Oneida class are of the Tortoise
clan.</p>

<p>35. <i>Dewatahonhtenyonk</i> (Onon.,
<i>Tehatahonhtenyonk</i>), "two<br>
hanging ears," from <i>ohonta</i>, ear.</p>

<p><i>Kaniyatahshayonk</i> (Onon., <i>Kanenyatakshayen</i>). This
name was<br>
rendered "easy throat," as if derived from <i>oniata</i>, throat;
but<br>
the Oneida form of the word seems to point to a derivation
from<br>
<i>onenya</i> (or <i>onenhia</i>), stone. This word must be
regarded as<br>
another obsolete compound.</p>

<p><i>Onwatsatonhonk</i> (Onon., <i>Onwasjatenwi</i>), "he is
buried."</p>

<p>The three chiefs of the third Oneida class are of the Bear
clan.</p>

<p>36. <i>Eghyesaotonnihsen</i>, lit., "this was his uncle,"&mdash;or,
as the<br>
words would be understood by the hearers, "the next are his
uncles." The<br>
Onondaga nation, being the brother of the Canienga, was, of
course, the<br>
uncle of the Oneida. In John Buck's MS. the Onondagas are
introduced<br>
with more ceremony, in the following lines:</p>

<p>  <i>Etho yeshodonnih</i>;   These are the uncles;<br>
  <i>Rodihsennakeghde</i>,   They, the name-bearers&mdash;<br>
  <i>Tehhotiyena</i>,        They took hold here;<br>
  <i>Rodihnonsyonnihton</i>. They made the League.</p>

<p>That is, they helped, or joined, in making the League.</p>

<p><i>Thatotarho, Wathatotarho</i> (Onon.,<br>
<i>Thatotarho</i>). <i>Thatotarho</i> is the passive voice
and<br>
cislocative form of <i>otarho</i>, which is defined "to grasp,"
or<br>
"catch" (<i>accrocher</i>) but in the passive signifies
"entangled."<br>
This great chief, whose name is better known as Atotarho (without
the<br>
cislocative prefix), is of the Bear clan.</p>

<p><i>Etho ronaraschsen</i>, "these were cousins," or rather,
"the next<br>
were cousins." This cousinhood, like all the relationships
throughout<br>
the book, is political, and indicates some close relationship in
public<br>
affairs. The announcement applies to the following chiefs,
Enneserarenh<br>
and Dehatkahthos, who were the special aids and counselors of
Atotarho.</p>

<p><i>Enneserarenh</i> (Onon. <i>Hanesehen</i>). One Onondata
chief said<br>
that he knew no meaning for this word. Another thought it might
mean<br>
"the best soil uppermost." It is apparently from some obsolete
root.</p>

<p><i>Dehatkahthos</i> (Onon. <i>Tchatkahtons</i>), "he is
two-sighted,"<br>
or, "he looks both ways." Another rendering made it "on the
watch." This<br>
and the preceding chief belong now to the Beaver clan. In one of
the<br>
Onondaga lists which I received, these two, with their
principal,<br>
Atotarho, formed a "class" by themselves, and were doubtless
originally<br>
of the same clan.</p>

<p><i>Waghontenhnonterontye</i>, "they were as brothers
thenceforth;" or,<br>
more fully rendered, "the next continued to be brothers."
 This<br>
declaration refers to the three next following chiefs, who
were<br>
connected by some special political tie. The first who bore the
name<br>
were, probably, like the two preceding chiefs, leading partisans
and<br>
favorites of the first Atotarho.</p>

<p><i>Onyatajiwak</i>, or <i>Skanyadajiwak</i> (Onon.,
<i>Oyatajiwak</i>).<br>
One authority makes this "a fowl's crop;" another, "the throat
alone,"<br>
from <i>oniata</i>, throat, and <i>jiwak</i>, alone; another
defined it,<br>
"bitter throat." Mr. Morgan renders it "bitter body,"&mdash;his
informant<br>
probably seeing in it the word <i>oyata</i>, body. This chief
belongs<br>
now to the Snipe clan.</p>

<p><i>Awekenyade</i>. "the end of its journey,"&mdash;from awe, going,
and<br>
<i>akonhiate</i>(Can.) "at the end." This chief is of the Ball
tribe,<br>
both in Canada, and at Onondaga Castle. In the list furnished
to<br>
Mr. Morgan by the Senecas, he is of the Tortoise clan.</p>

<p><i>Dehadkwarayen</i> (Onon., <i>Tchatkwayen</i>). This word
is<br>
obsolete. One interpreter guessed it to mean "on his body;"
another made<br>
it "red wings." He is of the Tortoise clan.</p>

<p>In the Book of Rites the first six chiefs of the Onondagas
make but one<br>
class, as is shown by the fact that their names are followed by
the<br>
formula, <i>etho natejonhne</i>, "this was the number of you." It
may be<br>
presumed that they were originally of one clan,&mdash;probably that of
the<br>
Bear, to which their leader, Atotarho, belonged.</p>

<p>37. <i>Yeshohawak</i>, <i>rakwahhokowah</i>, "then his next
son, he the<br>
great Wolf." The chief who follows, <i>Ronenghwireghtonh</i>,
was<br>
evidently a personage of great importance,&mdash;probably the leading
chief<br>
of the Wolf class. He forms a "clan" by himself,&mdash;the only
instance of<br>
the kind in the list. The expression, "there (or, in him) were
combined<br>
the minds," indicates&mdash;as Mr. Bearfoot suggests&mdash;his superior<br>
intellect. It may also refer to the fact that he was the
hereditary<br>
keeper of the wampum records. The title was borne in Canada by
the late<br>
chief George Buck, but the duties of record-keeper were
usually<br>
performed by his more eminent brother, John
(<i>Skanawati</i>).</p>

<p><i>Rononghwireghtonh</i> (Onon., <i>Honanwiehti</i>), "he is
sunk out of<br>
sight." This chief, who, as has been stated, alone constitutes
the<br>
second Onondaga class, is of the Wolf clan.</p>

<p>38. <i>Etho yeshotonnyh tekadarakehne</i>, "then his uncles of
the two<br>
clans." The five chiefs who follow probably bore some peculiar
political<br>
relation to Rononghwireghton. The first two in modern times are
of the<br>
Deer clan; the last three are of the Eel clan. It is probable
that they<br>
all belonged originally, with him, to one clan, that of the Wolf,
and<br>
consequently to one class, which was afterwards divided into
three.<br>
<i>Kawenenseronton</i> (Onon., <i>Kawenensenton</i>). A word of
doubtful<br>
meaning; one interpreter thought it meant "her voice
suspended."<br>
<i>Haghriron</i> (Onon., <i>Hahihon</i>), "spilled," or
"scattered."</p>

<p>39. <i>Wahhondennonterontye</i>. This word has already
occurred, with a<br>
different orthography, and is explained in the Note to Section
36.<br>
<i>Ronyennyennih</i> (Onon., <i>Honyennyenni</i>). No
satisfactory<br>
explanation could be obtained of this word. Chief John Buck did
not know<br>
its meaning. <i>Shodakwarashonh</i> (Onon., <i>Shotegwashen</i>),
"he<br>
is bruised."  <i>Shakokenghne</i> (Onon. <i>Shahkohkenneh</i>),
"he saw<br>
them."  As stated above, the three chiefs in this class are of
the Eel<br>
clan.</p>

<p>40. <i>Shihonadewiraralye, "they had children," or, rather,
"they<br>
continued to get children." Mr. Bearfoot writes in regard to this
word:<br>
"Yodewirare, a fowl hatching, referring to the time when they
were<br>
forming the league, when they were said to be hatching, or
producing,<br>
the children mentioned&mdash;i.e., the other tribes who were taken
into the<br>
confederacy."  </i> Tehhodidarakeh, "these the two clans." Taken
in<br>
connection with the preceding lines of the chant, it seems
probable that<br>
this expression refers to the introduction of other clans into
the<br>
Council besides the original three, the Bear, Wolf and Tortoise,
which<br>
existed when the confederacy was formed. <i>Raserhaghrhonh</i>
(Onon.,<br>
<i>Sherhakwi</i>), "wearing a hatchet in his belt," from
<i>asera</i>,<br>
hatchet. This chief is of the Tortoise clan. <i>Etho<br>
wahhoronghyaronnyon</i>, "this put away the clouds."  These
"clouds," it<br>
is said, were the clouds of war, which were dispelled by the
great chief<br>
whose name is thus introduced, <i>Skanawadyh</i>, or as now
spelt,<br>
<i>Skanawati</i>. He had the peculiar distinction of holding
two<br>
offices, which were rarely combined. He was both a high chief, or
"Lord<br>
of the Council," and a "Great Warrior." In former times the
members of<br>
the Great Council seldom assumed executive duties. They were
rarely sent<br>
out as ambassadors or as leaders of war-parties. These duties
were<br>
usually entrusted to the ablest chiefs of the second rank, who
were<br>
known as "Great Warriors," <i>rohskenrakehte-kowa</i>. Skanawati
was an<br>
exception to this rule. It would seem that the chief who first
bore this<br>
title had special aptitudes, which have come down in his family.
A<br>
striking instance, given in the "<i>Relations</i>" of the
Jesuit<br>
missionaries among the Hurons, has been admirably reproduced
by<br>
Mr. Parkman in the twenty-third chapter of his "Jesuits in
North<br>
America," and cannot be better told than in his words. In the
year 1648,<br>
during the desperate war between the Kanonsionni and the Hurons,
the<br>
Onondagas determined to respond to the pacific overtures which
they had<br>
received from their northern foes.</p>

<p>"They chose for their envoy," continues the historian,
"Scandawati, a<br>
man of renown, sixty years of age, joining with him two<br>
colleagues. [Footnote: <i>Scandawali</i> is the Huron&mdash;and
probably the<br>
original Onondaga&mdash;pronunciation of the name.] The old Onondaga
entered<br>
on his mission with a troubled mind. His anxiety was not so much
for his<br>
life as for his honor and dignity; for, while the Oneidas and
the<br>
Cayugas were acting in concurrence with the Onondagas, the
Senecas had<br>
refused any part in the embassy, and still breathed nothing
but<br>
war. Would they, or still more, the Mohawks, so far forget
the<br>
consideration due to one whose name had been great in the
Councils of<br>
the League, as to assault the Hurons while he was among them in
the<br>
character of an ambassador of his nation, whereby his honor would
be<br>
compromised and his life endangered? 'I am not a dead dog,' he
said, 'to<br>
be despised and forgotten. I am worthy that all men should turn
their<br>
eyes on me while I am among enemies, and do nothing that may
involve me<br>
in danger.' * * * Soon there came dire tidings. The prophetic
heart of<br>
the old chief had not deceived him. The Senecas and Mohawks,<br>
disregarding negotiations in which they had no part, and resolved
to<br>
bring them to an end, were invading the country in force. It
might be<br>
thought that the Hurons would take their revenge on the Onondaga
envoys,<br>
now hostages among them; but they did not do so, for the
character of an<br>
ambassador was, for the most part, held in respect. One
morning,<br>
however, Scandawati had disappeared. They were full of
excitement; for<br>
they thought that he had escaped to the enemy. They ranged the
woods in<br>
search of him, and at length found him in a thicket near the
town. He<br>
lay dead, on a bed of spruce boughs which he had made, his throat
deeply<br>
gashed with a knife. He had died by his own hand, a victim of
mortified<br>
pride. 'See,' writes Father Ragueneau, 'how much our Indians
stand on<br>
the point of honor!'"</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the same aptitude for affairs and
the same<br>
keen sense of honor which distinguished this highspirited chief
survives<br>
in the member of his family who, on the Canadian Reservation, now
bears<br>
the same title,&mdash;Chief John Buck,&mdash;whom his white neighbors all
admit to<br>
be both a capable ruler and an able and trustworthy
negotiator.</p>

<p>In Canada <i>Skanawati</i> is of the Tortoise clan. At
Onondaga, where<br>
the original family has probably died out, the title now belongs
to the<br>
Ball clan.</p>

<p>41. <i>Yeshohawak</i>, "then his next son,"&mdash;or rather,
perhaps, "then,<br>
next, his son." The Cayuga nation was politically the son of
the<br>
Onondaga nation. <i>Tekahenyonk</i> (Onon., <i>Hakaenyonk</i>),
"he<br>
looks both ways," or, "he examines warily." In section 28
(<i>ante</i><br>
p. 126) this name is spelt <i>Akahenyonh</i>. The prefixed
<i>te</i> is<br>
the duplicative particle, and gives the meaning of "spying on
both<br>
sides." This and the following chief belong, in Canada, to the
Deer<br>
clan, and constitute the first Cayuga class.
<i>Jinontaweraon</i><br>
(Onon., <i>Jinontaweyon</i>), "coming on its knees."</p>

<p>42. <i>Katakwarasonh</i> (Onon., <i>Ketagwajik), "it was
bruised."  This<br>
name, it will be seen, is very similar to that of an Onondaga<br>
chief,&mdash;</i>ante, Note to Section 39. The chief now named and the
one<br>
who follows are of the Bear clan. <i>Shoyonwese</i> (Onon.,<br>
<i>Soyonwes</i>), "he has a long wampumbelt."  The root-word of
this<br>
name is <i>oyonwa</i>, wampum-belt, the same that appears in<br>
<i>Hayonwatha</i>. <i>Atyaseronne</i> (Onon., <i>Halyasenne</i>),
"he<br>
puts one on another," or "he piles on." This chief is of the
Tortoise<br>
clan, and completes, with the two preceding councillors, the
second<br>
Cayuga class.</p>

<p>43. <i>Yeshonadadekenah</i>, "then they who are brothers."
 The three<br>
chiefs who follow are all of the Wolf clan, and make the third
class of<br>
the Cayuga councillors. <i>Teyoronghyonkeh</i> (Onon.,<br>
<i>Thowenyongo</i>), "it touches the sky."
 <i>Teyodhoreghkonh</i><br>
(Onon., <i>Tyotowegwi</i>), "doubly cold."
 <i>Wathyawenhehetken</i><br>
(Onon., <i>Thaowethon</i>), "mossy place."</p>

<p>44. The two following chiefs are of the Snipe clan, and
constitute the<br>
fourth and last Cayuga class. <i>Atontaraheha</i> (Onon.,<br>
<i>Hatontaheha</i>) "crowding himself in."  <i>Teskahe</i>
(Onon.,<br>
<i>Heskahe</i>) "resting on it."</p>

<p>45. <i>Yeshotonnih</i>, "and then his uncle." The Seneca
nation, being<br>
the brother of the Onondaga, is, of course, the uncle of the
Cayuga<br>
nation. <i>Skanyadariyo</i> (Onon., <i>Kanyataiyo</i>),
"beautiful<br>
lake;" originally, perhaps, "great lake." (See Appendix, Note B.)
 This<br>
name is spelt in Section 28 (<i>ante</i>, p. 128)
<i>Kanyadariyu</i>.<br>
The prefixed <i>s</i> is the sign of the reiterative form, and
when<br>
joined to proper names is regarded as a token of nobility,&mdash;like
the<br>
French <i>de</i>, or the German <i>von</i>. [Footnote: See J. A.
Cuoq:<br>
<i>Jugement Erron&eacute;</i>, etc., p. 57. "Le reiteratif est
comme un signe<br>
de noblesse dans les noms propres."]  <i>Kanyadariyo</i>, was one
of the<br>
two leading chiefs of the Senecas at the formation of the<br>
confederacy. The title belongs to the Wolf clan.<br>
<i>Yeshonaraseshen</i>, lit., "they were cousins." In the
present<br>
instance, and according to the Indian idiom, we must read
"Skanyadariyo,<br>
with his cousin, Shadekaronyes."  <i>Shadekaronyes</i>
(Onon.,<br>
<i>Shatekaenyes</i>), "skies of equal length." This chief
(whose<br>
successor now belongs to the Snipe clan) was in ancient times the
head<br>
of the second great division of the Senecas. These two potentates
were<br>
made a "class" in the Council by themselves, and were thus
required to<br>
deliberate together and come to an agreement on any question that
was<br>
brought up, before expressing an opinion in the council. This
ingenious<br>
device for preventing differences between the two sections of the
Seneca<br>
nation is one of the many evidences of statesmanship exhibited in
the<br>
formation of the League.</p>

<p>46. <i>Satyenawat</i>, "withheld." This chief, in the Canadian
list, is<br>
of the Snipe clan; in Mr. Morgan's Seneca list, he is of the
Bear<br>
clan. His comrade in the class, Shakenjowane, is, in both lists,
of the<br>
Hawk clan. <i>Shakenjowane</i> (Onon., <i>Shakenjona</i>),
"large<br>
forehead."</p>

<p>There has apparently been some derangement here in the order
of the<br>
classes. In Mr. Morgan's list, and also in one furnished to me
at<br>
Onondaga Castle, the two chiefs just named belong to
different<br>
classes. The variance of the lists may be thus shown:&mdash;</p>

<p>  <i>The Book of Rites</i>. <i>The Seneca and Onondaga
Lists</i>.<br>
            Second Seneca Class.<br>
  <i>Satyenawat</i> <i>Kanokarih</i><br>
  <i>Shakenjowane</i> <i>Shakenjowane</i>.<br>
            Third Seneca Class.<br>
  <i>Kanokarih</i> <i>Satyenawat</i><br>
  <i>Nisharyenen</i> <i>Nisharyenen</i>.</p>

<p>Satyenawat and Kanokarih have changed places. As the Book of
Rites is<br>
the earlier authority, it is probable that the change was made
among the<br>
New York Senecas after a part of their nation had removed to
Canada.</p>

<p>47. <i>Kanokarih</i> (Onon., <i>Kanokaehe</i>),
"threatened."<br>
    <i>Nisharyenen</i> (Onon., <i>Onishayenenha</i>), "the day
fell down."</p>

<p>One of the interpreters rendered the latter name, "the handle
drops."<br>
The meaning of the word must be considered doubtful. The first of
these<br>
chiefs is of the Tortoise clan, and the second is, in Canada, of
the<br>
Bear clan. In Mr. Morgan's list he is of the Snipe clan. The
disruption<br>
of the Seneca nation, and the introduction of new clans, have
thrown<br>
this part of the list into confusion.</p>

<p>48. <i>Onghwakeghaghshonah</i>, etc. The verses which follow
are<br>
repeated here from the passage of the Book which precedes the
chanted<br>
litany. (See <i>ante</i>, Section 28.) Their repetition is
intended to<br>
introduce the names of the two chiefs who composed the fourth and
last<br>
class of the Seneca councillors. <i>Yatehhotinhohhataghkwen</i>,
"they<br>
were at the doorway," or, according to another version, "they
made the<br>
doorway."  The chiefs are represented as keeping the doorway of
the<br>
"extended mansion," which imaged the confederacy.<br>
<i>Kanonghkeridawyh</i>, (Onon., <i>Kanonkeitawi</i>,) "entangled
hair<br>
given." This chief, in Canada, is of the Bear clan; in New
York,<br>
according to Morgan's list, he is of the Snipe clan.<br>
<i>Teyoninhokarawenh</i>, (Onon., <i>Teyoninhokawenh</i>,) "open
door."<br>
In both lists he is of the Wolf clan.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan (in his "League of the Iroquois," page 68,) states
that to<br>
the last-named chief, or "sachem," the duty of watching the door
was<br>
assigned, and that "they gave him a sub-sachem, or assistant, to
enable<br>
him to execute this trust."  In fact, however, every high chief,
or<br>
<i>royaner</i> (lord), had an assistant, or war chief<br>
(<i>roskenrakehte-kowa</i>, great warrior), to execute his<br>
instructions. The Book of Rites shows clearly that the two chiefs
to<br>
whom the duty of "guarding the doorway" was assigned were both
nobles of<br>
the first rank. Their office also appears not to have been
warlike. From<br>
the words of the Book it would seem that when new tribes were
received<br>
into the confederacy, these two councillors had the formal office
of<br>
"opening the doorway" to the new-comers&mdash;that is (as we may
suppose),<br>
of receiving and introducing their chiefs into the federal
council.</p>

<p>In another sense the whole Seneca nation was deemed, and was
styled in<br>
council, the Doorkeeper (<i>Ronhohonti</i>, pl.,
<i>Roninhohonti</i>) of<br>
the confederacy. The duty of guarding the common country against
the<br>
invasions of the hostile tribes of the west was specially
committed to<br>
them. Their leaders, or public representatives, in this duty
would<br>
naturally be the two great chiefs of the nation, Kanyateriyo
and<br>
Shadekaronyes. The rules of the League, however, seem to have
forbidden<br>
the actual assumption by the councillors of any executive or
warlike<br>
command. At least, if they undertook such duties, it must be as
private<br>
men, and not in their capacity of nobles&mdash;just as an English peer
might<br>
serve as an officer in the army or as an ambassador. The only
exceptions<br>
recognized by the Iroquois constitution seem to have been in the
cases<br>
of Tekarihoken and Skanawati, who were at once nobles and<br>
war-chiefs. (See <i>ante</i>, pages 78 and 159.) The two great
Seneca<br>
chiefs would therefore find it necessary to make over their
military<br>
functions to their assistants or war-chiefs. This may explain
the<br>
statement made by Morgan ("League of the Iroquois," p. 74) that
there<br>
were two special "war-chiefships" created among the Senecas, to
which<br>
these commands were assigned.</p>

<p>49. <i>Onenh watyonkwentendane kanikonrakeh</i>. The condoling
chant<br>
concludes abruptly with the doleful exclamation, "Now we are
dejected in<br>
spirit." <i>Enkitenlane</i>, "I am becoming poor," or "wretched,"
is<br>
apparently a derivative of <i>kitenre</i>, to pity, and might
be<br>
rendered, "I am in a pitiable state." "We are miserable in mind,"
would<br>
probably be a literal version of this closing ejaculation.
Whether it is<br>
a lament for the past glories of the confederacy, or for the
chief who<br>
is mourned, is a question which those who sing the words at the
present<br>
day would probably have a difficulty in answering. It is
likely,<br>
however, that the latter cause of grief was in the minds of those
who<br>
first composed the chant.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact, as showing the antiquity of the
names of the<br>
chiefs in the foregoing list, that at least a fourth of them are
of<br>
doubtful etymology. That their meaning was well understood when
they<br>
were borne by the founders of the League cannot be questioned.
The<br>
changes of language or the uncertainties of oral transmission, in
the<br>
lapse of four centuries, have made this large proportion of them
either<br>
obsolete or so corrupt as to be no longer intelligible. Of all
the<br>
names it may probably be affirmed with truth that the Indians who
hear<br>
them recited think of their primitive meaning as little as we
ourselves<br>
think of the meaning of the family names or the English titles
of<br>
nobility which we hear or read. To the Iroquois of the present
day the<br>
hereditary titles of their councillors are&mdash;to use their own<br>
expression&mdash;"just names," and nothing more. It must not be
supposed,<br>
however, that the language itself has altered in the same degree.
Proper<br>
names, as is well known, when they become mere appellatives,
discharged<br>
of significance, are much more likely to vary than the words of
ordinary<br>
speech.</p>

<p>NOTES ON THE ONONDAGA BOOK</p>

<p>1 <i>a. Yo onen onen wen ni sr te,</i> "oh now&mdash;now this day."
 It will<br>
be noticed that this address of the "younger brothers" commences
in<br>
nearly the same words which begin the speeches of the
Canienga<br>
book. This similarity of language exists in other parts of the
two<br>
books, though disguised by the difference of dialect, and also by
the<br>
very irregular and corrupt spelling of the Onondaga book. To give
some<br>
idea of this irregularity, and of the manner in which the words
of this<br>
book are to be pronounced, several of these words are subjoined,
with<br>
the pronunciation of the interpreter, represented in the
orthography of<br>
the Canienga book:</p>

<p>  <i>Words as written.</i>         <i>As pronounced by La
Fort.</i></p>

<p>  wen ni sr te                     wennisaate<br>
  ho gar a nyat                    hogaenyat<br>
  son tar yen                      sontahien<br>
  na ya ne                         nayeneh<br>
  o shon ta gon gonar              osontagongona<br>
  gar weear har tye                gawehehatie<br>
  on gwr non sen shen tar qua      ongwanonsenshentakwa<br>

  o wen gr ge                      ohwengage<br>
  nar ya he yr genh                nayehiyaken.</p>

<p>The letter <i>r,</i> it will be seen, is not a consonant. In
fact, it is<br>
never heard as such in the modern Onondaga dialect. As used by La
Fort,<br>
its office is either to give to the preceding vowel <i>a</i> the
sound<br>
which it has in <i>father,</i> or by itself to represent that
sound. The<br>
<i>a,</i> when not followed by <i>r,</i> is usually sounded
like<br>
<i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>, but sometimes keeps the sound of
<i>a</i> in<br>
<i>far.</i> The <i>e</i> usually represents the English <i>e</i>
in<br>
<i>be,</i> or, when followed by <i>n,</i> the <i>e</i> in
<i>pen.</i><br>
The <i>i</i> and <i>y</i> are commonly sounded as in the word<br>
<i>city.</i> The <i>g</i> is always hard, and is interchangeable
with<br>
<i>k.</i> The <i>t</i> and <i>d</i> are also interchangeable.</p>

<p>While the syllables in the original are written separately,
the words<br>
are not always distinguished; and it is doubtful if, in printing,
they<br>
have in all cases been properly divided. The translation of
the<br>
interpreter, though tolerably exact, was not always literal; and
in the<br>
brief time at our command the precise meaning of some of the
words was<br>
not ascertained. No attempt, therefore, has been made to form
a<br>
glossary of this portion of the text.</p>

<p>In the original the addresses of the "younger brothers" are
divided into<br>
sections, which are numbered from one to seven, and each of
which, in<br>
the ceremony, is called to mind by its special wampum-string,
which is<br>
produced when the section is recited. As the first of these
sections is<br>
of much greater length than the others, it has been divided in
this<br>
work, for the purpose of ready reference, into sub-sections,
which are<br>
numbered 1<i>a</i>, 1<i>b</i>, and so on.</p>

<p>1 <i>b</i>. <i>Nenthaotagenhetak</i>, "by the ashes," or "near
the<br>
hearth." The root-word is here <i>agenhe</i>, the Onondaga form
of the<br>
Canienga word <i>akenra</i>, ashes, which is comprised in the
compound<br>
form, <i>jiudakenrokde</i>, in Section 27 of the Canienga book.
It will<br>
be seen that the spokesman of the younger nations is here
complying<br>
strictly with the law laid down in that section. He "stands by
the<br>
hearth and speaks a few words to comfort those who are
mourning."</p>

<p>1 <i>c</i>. "<i>It was valued at twenty.</i>" The interpreters
explained<br>
that by "twenty" was understood the whole of their wampum,
which<br>
constituted all their treasure. A human life was worth the whole
of<br>
this, and they freely gave it, merely to recall the memory of the
chief<br>
who was gone. Among the Hurons, when a man had been killed, and
his<br>
kindred were willing to renounce their claim to vengeance on
receiving<br>
due satisfaction, the number of presents of wampum and other
valuables<br>
which were to be given was rigidly prescribed by their
customary<br>
law. [Footnote: <i>Relation</i> of 1648, p. 80.] From this custom
would<br>
easily follow the usage of making similar gifts, in token of
sympathy,<br>
to all persons who were mourning the loss of a near relative,</p>

<p>1 <i>d</i>. "<i>Because with her the line is lost.</i>" The
same<br>
sentiment prevailed among the Hurons. "For a Huron killed by a
Huron,"<br>
writes Father Ragueneau in the letter just quoted, "thirty gifts
are<br>
commonly deemed a sufficient satisfaction. For a woman forty
are<br>
required, because, as they say, the women are less able to
defend<br>
themselves; and, moreover, they being the source whence the land
is<br>
peopled, their lives should be deemed of more value to the
commonwealth,<br>
and their weakness should have a stronger support in public
justice."<br>
Such was the reasoning of these heathen barbarians.
Enlightened<br>
Christendom has hardly yet advanced to the mark of these
opinions.</p>

<p>I <i>e. "Where the grave has been made,"</i> &amp;c. The
recital of Father<br>
Ragueneau also illustrates this passage. "Then followed," he
writes,<br>
"nine other presents, for the purpose, as it were, of erecting
a<br>
sepulchre for the deceased. Four of them were for the four
pillars which<br>
should support this sepulchre, and four others for the four
cross-pieces<br>
on which the bier of the dead was to rest. The ninth was to serve
as his<br>
pillow."</p>

<p>2. "I will make the sky clear to you." In this paragraph the
speaker<br>
reminds the mourners, in the style of bold imagery which the
Iroquois<br>
orators affected, that continued grief for the dead would not
be<br>
consonant with the course of nature. Though all might seem dark
to them<br>
now, the sky would be as clear, and the sun would shine as
brightly for<br>
them, as if their friend had not died. Their loss had been
inevitable,<br>
and equally sure would be the return of the "pleasant days."
This<br>
reminder, which may seem to us needless, was evidently designed
as a<br>
reproof, at once gentle and forcible, of those customs of
excessive and<br>
protracted mourning which were anciently common among the
Huron-Iroquois<br>
tribes.</p>

<p>3. <i>"You must converse with your nephews,"</i> &amp;c. The
"nephews" are,<br>
of course, the chiefs of the younger nations, who are here
the<br>
condolers. The mourners are urged to seek for comfort in the
sympathy of<br>
their friends, and not to reject the consolations offered by
their<br>
visitors and by their own people.</p>

<p>4. <i>"And now you can go out before the people, and go on
with your<br>
duties,"</i> &amp;c. This, it will be seen, corresponds with the
injunctions<br>
of the Canienga book. (See Section 27, <i>ante,</i> p. 127): "And
then<br>
they will be comforted, and will conform to the great law."</p>

<p>6. <i>"Then the horns shall be left on the grave,"</i> &amp;c.
The same<br>
figure is here used as in the Canienga book, Section 23
(<i>ante,</i><br>
p. 125). It is evident that the importance of keeping up the
succession<br>
of their councillors was constantly impressed on the minds of
the<br>
Iroquois people by the founders of their League.</p>

<p>7. <i>"And the next death will receive the pouch."</i> The
"mourning<br>
wampum," in modern days, is left, or supposed to be left, with
the<br>
kindred of the late chief until another death shall occur among
the<br>
members of the Council, when it is to be passed on to the family
of the<br>
deceased. This economy is made necessary by the fact that only
one store<br>
of such wampum now exists, as the article is no longer made. It
is<br>
probable that in ancient times the wampum was left permanently
with the<br>
family of the deceased, as a memorial of the departed chief.</p>

<p><i>"Where the fire is made and the smoke is rising," i.e.,</i>
when you<br>
receive notice that a Condoling Council is to be held in a
certain<br>
place. The kindled fire and the rising smoke were the
well-understood<br>
images which represented the convocation of their councils. In
the<br>
Onondaga book before referred to (<i>ante,</i> p. 152) a few
pages were<br>
occupied by what might be styled a pagan sermon, composed of<br>
exhortations addressed to the chiefs, urging them to do their
duty to<br>
the community. The following is the commencement of this
curious<br>
composition, which may serve to illustrate both the words now
under<br>
consideration and the character of the people. The orthography is
much<br>
better than that of La Fort's book, the vowels generally having
the<br>
Italian sound, and the spelling being tolerably uniform. The
translation<br>
was made by Albert Cusick, and is for the most part closely
literal: The<br>
discourse commences with a "text," after the fashion which the
pagan<br>
exhorter had probably learned from the missionaries:&mdash;</p>

<p><br>
<i>Translation.</i></p>

<p>"The law says this:</p>

<p>"Now the council-fire was lighted by Atotarho. Now the smoke
rises and<br>
ascends to the sky, that everybody may see it. The tribes of
the<br>
different nations where the smoke appeared shall come directly
where the<br>
smoke arises, if, perhaps, they have any business for the council
to<br>
consider.</p>

<p>"These are the words of our law,&mdash;of the Six Nations of
Indians.</p>

<p>"What is the purpose of the smoke? It is this&mdash;that the chiefs
must all<br>
be honest; that they must all love one another; and that they
must have<br>
regard for their people,&mdash;including the women, and also our
children,<br>
and also those children whom we have not yet seen; so much they
must<br>
care for, that all may be in peace, even the whole nation. It is
the<br>
duty of the chiefs to do this, and they have the power to govern
their<br>
people. If there is anything to be done for the good of the
people, it<br>
is their duty to do it."</p>

<p>7 <i>b. "Now I have finished! Now show him to me!"</i> With
this laconic<br>
exclamation, which calls upon the nation of the late chief to
bring<br>
forward his successor, the formal portion of the
ceremony&mdash;the<br>
condolence which precedes the installation&mdash;is abruptly
closed.</p>

<p>APPENDIX.</p>

<p><br>
NOTE A.</p>

<p>THE NAMES OF THE IROQUOIS NATIONS.</p>

<p>The meaning of the term <i>Kanonsionni,</i> and of the other
names by<br>
which the several nations were known in their Council, are
fully<br>
explained in the Introduction. But some account should be given
of the<br>
names, often inappropriate and generally much corrupted, by which
they<br>
were known to their white neighbors. The origin and proper
meaning of<br>
the word <i>Iroquois</i> are doubtful. All that can be said
with<br>
certainty is that the explanation given by Charlevoix cannot
possibly be<br>
correct. "The name of Iroquois," he says, "is purely French, and
has<br>
been formed from the term <i>hiro,</i> 'I have spoken,' a word by
which<br>
these Indians close all their speeches, and <i>koue,</i> which,
when<br>
long drawn out, is a cry of sorrow, and when briefly uttered, is
an<br>
exclamation of joy." [Footnote: <i>History of New France,</i>
Vol. i,<br>
p. 270.] It might be enough to say of this derivation that no
other<br>
nation or tribe of which we have any knowledge has ever borne a
name<br>
composed in this whimsical fashion. But what is decisive is the
fact<br>
that Champlain had learned the name from his Indian allies before
he or<br>
any other Frenchman, so far as is known, had ever seen an
Iroquois. It<br>
is probable that the origin of the word is to be sought in the
Huron<br>
language; yet, as this is similar to the Iroquois tongue, an
attempt may<br>
be made to find a solution in the latter. According to Bruyas,
the word<br>
<i>garokwa</i> meant a pipe, and also a piece of tobacco,&mdash;and,
in its<br>
verbal form, to smoke. This word is found, somewhat disguised
by<br>
aspirates, in the Book of Rites&mdash;<i>denighroghkwayen,</i>&mdash;"let
us two<br>
smoke together." (<i>Ante.</i> p. 114, Section 2). In the
indeterminate<br>
form the verb becomes <i>ierokwa,</i> which is certainly very
near to<br>
"Iroquois." It might be rendered "they who smoke," or "they who
use<br>
tobacco," or, briefly, "the Tobacco People." This name, the
Tobacco<br>
Nation (<i>Nation du</i> <i>Petun</i>) was given by the French,
and<br>
probably also by the Algonkins, to one of the Huron tribes,
the<br>
Tionontates, noted for the excellent tobacco which they raised
and<br>
sold. The Iroquois were equally well known for their cultivation
of this<br>
plant, of which they had a choice variety. [Footnote: "The
Senecas still<br>
cultivate tobacco. Its name signifies '<i>the only tobacco,'</i>
because<br>
they consider this variety superior to all others."&mdash;Morgan:
<i>League<br>
of the Iroquois,</i> p. 375.] It is possible that their
northern<br>
neighbors may have given to them also a name derived from
this<br>
industry. Another not improbable supposition might connect the
name with<br>
that of a leading sept among them, the Bear clan. This clan, at
least<br>
among the Caniengas, seems to have been better known than any
other to<br>
their neighbors. The Algonkins knew that nation as the Maquas,
or<br>
Bears. In the Canienga speech, bear is <i>ohkwari</i>; in
Onondaga, the<br>
word becomes <i>ohkwai</i>, and in Cayuga, <i>iakwai</i>,&mdash;which
also is<br>
not far from <i>Iroquois</i>. These conjectures&mdash;for they are
nothing<br>
more&mdash;may both be wrong; but they will perhaps serve to show
the<br>
direction in which the explanation of this perplexing word is to
be<br>
sought.</p>

<p>The name of <i>Mingo</i> or <i>Mengwe,</i> by which the
Iroquois were<br>
known to the Delawares and the other southern Algonkins, is said
to be a<br>
contraction of the Lenape word <i>Mahongwi</i>, meaning the
"People of<br>
the Springs." [Footnote: E. G. Squier: <i>"Traditions of the<br>
Algonquins,"</i> in Beach's Indian Miscellany, p. 28.] The
Iroquois<br>
possessed the headwaters of the rivers which flowed through the
country<br>
of the Delawares, and this explanation of the name may therefore
be<br>
accepted as a probable one.</p>

<p>The first of the Iroquois nations, the "oldest brother" of
the<br>
confederacy, has been singularly unfortunate in the designations
by<br>
which it has become generally known. The people have a fine,
sonorous<br>
name of their own, said to be derived from that of one of their
ancient<br>
towns. This name is <i>Kanienke</i>, "at the Flint."
 <i>Kansen</i>, in<br>
their language, signifies flint, and the final syllable is the
same<br>
locative particle which we find in <i>Onontake,</i> "at the
mountain."<br>
In pronunciation and spelling, this, like other Indian words, is
much<br>
varied, both by the natives themselves and by their white
neighbors,<br>
becoming <i>Kanieke, Kanyenke, Canyangeh,</i> and
<i>Canienga.</i> The<br>
latter form, which accords with the sister names of Onondaga and
Cayuga,<br>
has been adopted in the present volume.</p>

<p>The Huron frequently drops the initial <i>k,</i> or changes it
to<br>
<i>y.</i> The Canienga people are styled in that speech
<i>Yanyenge,</i><br>
a word which is evidently the origin of the name of
<i>Agnier,</i> by<br>
which this nation is known to the French.</p>

<p>The Dutch learned from the Mohicans (whose name, signifying
Wolves, is<br>
supposed to be derived from that of their leading clan) to call
the<br>
Kanienke by the corresponding name of <i>Maqua</i> (or
<i>Makwa</i>),<br>
the Algonkin word for Bear. But as the Iroquois, and especially
the<br>
Caniengas, became more and more a terror to the surrounding
nations, the<br>
feelings of aversion and dread thus awakened found vent in an<br>
opprobrious epithet, which the southern and eastern Algonkins
applied to<br>
their obnoxious neighbors. They were styled by these enemies<br>
<i>Mowak,</i> or <i>Mowawak</i> a word which has been corrupted
to<br>
<i>Mohawk.</i> It is the third person plural, in the sixth
"transition,"<br>
of the Algonkin word <i>mowa</i>, which means "to eat," but which
is<br>
only used of food that has had life. Literally it means "they eat
them;"<br>
but the force of the verb and of the pronominal inflection
suffices to<br>
give to the word, when used as an appellative, the meaning of
"those who<br>
eat men," or, in other words, "the Cannibals." That the English,
with<br>
whom the Caniengas were always fast friends, should have adopted
this<br>
uncouth and spiteful nickname is somewhat surprising. It is time
that<br>
science and history should combine to banish it, and to resume
the<br>
correct designation. [Footnote: William Penn and his colonists,
who<br>
probably understood the meaning of the word <i>Mohawk</i> forbore
to<br>
employ it. In the early records of the colony (published by
the<br>
Pennsylvania Historical Society) the nation is described in
treaties,<br>
laws, and other public acts, by its proper designation, a
little<br>
distorted in the spelling,&mdash;<i>Canyingoes, Ganyingoes,
Cayinkers,<br>
etc.</i>]</p>

<p>The name <i>Oneida</i>, which in French became
<i>Onneyoutk</i> or<br>
<i>Onneyote</i>, is a corruption of a compound word, formed
of<br>
<i>onenhia</i>, or <i>onenya</i>, stone, and <i>kaniote</i>, to
be<br>
upright or elevated. <i>Onenniote</i> is rendered "the
projecting<br>
stone." It is applied to a large boulder of syennite, which
thrusts its<br>
broad shoulder above the earth at the summit of an eminence near
which,<br>
in early times, the Oneidas had planted their chief
settlement.</p>

<p>As has been already stated, <i>Onondaga</i> is a softened
pronunciation<br>
of <i>Onontake</i>, "at the mountain,"&mdash;or, perhaps, more
exactly, "at<br>
the hill." It is probable that this name was unknown when the<br>
confederacy was formed, as it is not comprised in the list of
towns<br>
given in the Book of Rites. It may be supposed to have been
first<br>
applied to this nation after their chief town was removed to the
site<br>
which it occupied in the year 1654, when the first white visitors
of<br>
whom we have any certain account, the Jesuit Father Le Moyne and
his<br>
party, came among them,&mdash;and also in 1677, when the English
explorer,<br>
Greenhalgh, passed through their country. This site was about
seven<br>
miles east of their present Reservation. I visited it in
September,<br>
1880, in company with my friend, General John S. Clark, who has
been<br>
singularly successful in identifying the positions of the
ancient<br>
Iroquois towns. The locality is thus described in my journal:
"The site<br>
is, for an Indian town, peculiarly striking and attractive. It
stretches<br>
about three miles in length, with a width of half a mile, along
the<br>
broad back and gently sloping sides of a great hill, which
swells, like<br>
a vast oblong cushion, between two hollows made by branches of a
small<br>
stream, known as Limehouse creek. These streams and many springs
on the<br>
hillside yielded abundance of water, while the encircling ridges
on<br>
every side afforded both firewood and game. In the neighborhood
were<br>
rich valleys, where&mdash;as well as on the hill itself&mdash;the people
raised<br>
their crops of corn, beans, pumpkins, and tobacco. There are
signs of a<br>
large population." In the fields of stubble which occupied the
site of<br>
this ancient capital, the position of the houses could still be
traced<br>
by the dark patches of soil; and a search of an hour or two
rewarded us<br>
with several wampum-beads, flint chips, and a copper coin of the
last<br>
century. The owner of the land, an intelligent farmer, affirmed
that<br>
"wagon-loads" of Indian wares,&mdash;pottery, hatchets, stone
implements, and<br>
the like&mdash;had been carried off by curiosity seekers.</p>

<p>The name of the <i>Cayugas</i> (in French <i>Goyogouin</i>) is
variously<br>
pronounced by the Iroquois themselves. I wrote it as I heard it,
at<br>
different times, from members of the various tribes.
<i>Koy&uacute;kwe&ntilde;,<br>
Koi&uacute;kwe, Kwai&uacute;kwe&ntilde;, Kay&uacute;kwe.</i> A
Cayuga chief made it <i>Kay&uacute;kwa,</i><br>
which is very near the usual English pronunciation of the word.
Of its<br>
purport no satisfactory account could be obtained. One
interpreter<br>
rendered it "the fruit country," another "the place where canoes
are<br>
drawn out." Cusick, the historian, translates it "a mountain
rising from<br>
the water." Mr. Morgan was told that it meant "the mucky land."
We can<br>
only infer that the interpreters were seeking, by vague
resemblances, to<br>
recover a lost meaning.</p>

<p>The <i>Senecas</i>, who were called by the French
<i>Tsonontouan</i> or<br>
<i>Sonnontouan</i>, bore among the Iroquois various names, but
all<br>
apparently derived from the words which appear in that
appellation,<br>
&mdash;<i>ononta</i>, hill, and <i>kowa</i> or <i>kowane,</i> great.
The<br>
Caniengas called them <i>Tsonontowane</i>; the Oneidas abridged
the word<br>
to <i>Tsontowana</i>; the Cayugas corrupted it to
<i>Onondewa</i>; and<br>
the Onondagas contracted it yet farther, to <i>Nontona</i>. The
Senecas<br>
called themselves variously <i>Sonontowa, Onontewa,</i> and<br>
<i>Nondewa.</i> <i>Sonontowane</i> is probably the most correct
form.</p>

<p>The word <i>Seneca</i> is supposed to be of Algonkin origin,
and like<br>
<i>Mohawk</i>, to have been given as an expression of dislike, or
rather<br>
of hostility. <i>Sinako</i>, in the Delaware tongue, means
properly<br>
"Stone Snakes;" but in this conjunction it is understood,
according to<br>
the interpretation furnished to Mr. Squier, to signify
"Mountain<br>
Snakes." [Footnote: <i>"Traditions of the Algonquins,"</i> in
Beach's<br>
<i>Indian Miscellany,</i> p. 33.] The Delawares, it appears,
were<br>
accustomed to term all their enemies "snakes." In this case they
simply<br>
translated the native name of the Iroquois tribe (the
"Mountain<br>
People"), and added this uncomplimentary epithet. As the name,
unlike<br>
the word Mohawk, is readily pronounced by the people to whom it
was<br>
given, and as they seem to have in some measure accepted it,
there is<br>
not the same reason for objecting to its use as exists in the
case of<br>
the latter word,&mdash;more especially as there is no absolute
certainty that<br>
it is not really an Iroquois word. It bears, in its present form,
a<br>
close resemblance to the honorable "Council name" of the<br>
Onondagas,&mdash;<i>Sennakehte,</i> "the title-givers;" a fact which
may<br>
perhaps have made the western nation more willing to adopt
it.</p>

<p><br>
NOTE B.</p>

<p>MEANING OF OHIO, ONTARIO, ONONTIO, RAWENNIIO.</p>

<p>The words <i>Ohio, Ontario</i> and <i>Onontio</i> (or<br>
<i>Yonnondio</i>)&mdash;which should properly be pronounced as if
written<br>
<i>Oheeyo, Ontareeyo,</i> and <i>Ononteeyo</i>&mdash;are commonly
rendered<br>
"Beautiful River," "Beautiful Lake," "Beautiful Mountain."
This,<br>
doubtless, is the meaning which each of the words conveys to an
Iroquois<br>
of the present day, unless he belongs to the Tuscarora tribe. But
there<br>
can be no doubt that the termination <i>io</i> (otherwise
written<br>
<i>iyo, iio, eeyo</i>, etc.) had originally the sense, not of<br>
"beautiful," but of "great." It is derived from the word
<i>wiyo</i> (or<br>
<i>wiio</i>) which signifies in the Seneca dialect <i>good,</i>
but in<br>
the Tuscarora, <i>great</i>. It is certain that the Tuscaroras
have<br>
preserved the primitive meaning of the word, which the Hurons and
the<br>
proper Iroquois have lost. When the French missionaries first
studied<br>
the languages of these nations, traces of the original usage
were<br>
apparent. Bruyas, in the "Proemium" to his <i>Radices
Verborum<br>
Iroquaorum</i>, (p. 14), expressly states that <i>jo (io)</i>
in<br>
composition with verbs, "signifies magnitude." He gives as an
example,<br>
<i>garihaioston</i>, "to make much of anything," from
<i>garihea</i>,<br>
thing, and <i>io</i>, "great, important." The Jesuit
missionaries, in<br>
their <i>Relation</i> for 1641, (p. 22) render <i>Onontio</i>
"great<br>
mountain," and say that both Hurons and Iroquois gave this title
to the<br>
Governor of that day as a translation of his name, Montmagny.</p>

<p><i>Ontario</i> is derived from the Huron <i>yontare</i>,
or<br>
<i>ontare</i>, lake (Iroquois, <i>oniatare</i>), with this<br>
termination. It was not by any means the most beautiful of the
lakes<br>
which they knew; but in the early times, when the Hurons dwelt on
the<br>
north and east of it and the Iroquois on the south, it was to
both of<br>
them emphatically "the great lake."</p>

<p><i>Ohio,</i> in like manner, is derived, as M. Cuoq in the
valuable<br>
notes to his Lexicon (p. 159) informs us, from the obsolete
<i>ohia,</i><br>
river, now only used in the compound form <i>ohionha</i>.
<i>Ohia</i>,<br>
coalescing with this ancient affix, would become <i>ohiio,</i>
or<br>
<i>ohiyo,</i> with the signification of "great river," or, as
the<br>
historian Cusick renders it, "principal stream."</p>

<p>M. Cuoq. in his <i>"Etudes Philologiques"</i> (p. 14) has well
explained<br>
the interesting word <i>Rawenniio,</i> used in various
dialectical forms<br>
by both Hurons and Iroquois, as the name of the deity. It
signifies, as<br>
he informs us, "he is master," or, used as a noun, "he who is
master."<br>
This, of course, is the modern acceptation; but we can gather
from the<br>
ancient Huron grammar, translated by Mr. Wilkie, (<i>ante</i>, p.
101)<br>
that the word had once, as might be supposed, a larger meaning.
The<br>
phrase, "it is the great master," in that grammar (p. 108) is
rendered<br>
<i>ondaieaat eOarontio or eOauendio</i>. The Huron <i>nd</i>
becomes in<br>
Iroquois <i>nn</i>. <i>EOauendio</i> is undoubtedly a form of the
same<br>
word which appears in the Iroquois <i>Rawenniio</i>. We thus
learn that<br>
the latter word meant originally not merely "the master," but
"the great<br>
master." Its root is probably to be found in the Iroquois
<i>kawen</i>,<br>
or <i>gawen</i> (Bruyas, p. 64), which signifies "to belong to
any one,"<br>
and yields, in combination with <i>oyata</i>, person, the
derivatives<br>
<i>gaiatawen</i>, to have for subject, and <i>gaiatawenston</i>,
to<br>
subject any one.</p>

<p><br>
NOTE C.</p>

<p>THE ERA OF THE CONFEDERACY.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan, in his work on "Systems of Consanguinity and
Affinity of the<br>
Human Family" (p. 151), fixes the date of the formation of the
Iroquois<br>
league at about the middle of the fifteenth ^ century. He says:
"As near<br>
as can now be ascertained, the league had been established about
one<br>
hundred and fifty years when Champlain, in 1609, first
encountered the<br>
Mohawks within their own territories, on the west coast of
Lake<br>
George. This would place the epoch of its formation about A. D.
1459."<br>
Mr. Morgan, as he informed me, deduced this conclusion from
the<br>
testimony of the most intelligent Indians whom he had consulted
on the<br>
subject. His informants belonged chiefly to the Seneca and
Tuscarora<br>
nations. Their statements are entirely confirmed by those of
the<br>
Onondaga record-keepers, both on the Syracuse Reservation and
in<br>
Canada. When the chiefs at Onondaga Castle, who, in October,
1875, met<br>
to explain to me their wampum records, were asked how long it had
been<br>
since their league was made, they replied (as I find the answer
recorded<br>
in my notes) that "it was their belief that the confederacy was
formed<br>
about six generations before the white people came to these
parts."<br>
Hudson ascended the river to which he gave his name in
September,<br>
1609. A boat from his ship advanced beyond Albany, and
consequently into<br>
the territories of the League. "Frequent intercourse," says
Bancroft, in<br>
his account of this exploration, "was held with the astonished
natives<br>
of the Algonquin race; and the strangers were welcomed by a
deputation<br>
from the Mohawks."  If we allow twenty-five years to a
generation, the<br>
era of the confederacy is carried back to a period a hundred and
fifty<br>
years before the date of Hudson's discovery,&mdash;or to the year
1459. This<br>
statement of the Onondaga chiefs harmonizes, therefore, closely
with<br>
that which Mr. Morgan had heard among the other nations.</p>

<p>I afterwards (in 1882) put the same question to my friend,
Chief John<br>
Buck, the keeper of the wampum-records of the Canadian Iroquois.
He<br>
thought it was then "about four hundred years" since the League
was<br>
formed. He was confident that it was before any white people had
been<br>
heard of by his nation. This opinion accords sufficiently with
the more<br>
definite statement of the New York Onondagas to be deemed a
confirmation<br>
of that statement.</p>

<p>There are two authorities whose opinions differ widely, in
opposite<br>
directions, from the information thus obtained by Mr. Morgan
and<br>
myself. David Cusick, in his <i>"Sketches of Ancient History of
the Six<br>
Nations,"</i> supposes that the League was formed "perhaps 1000
years<br>
before Columbus discovered America." His reasons for this
supposition,<br>
however, do not bear examination. He makes Atotarho the
hereditary<br>
title of a monarch, like Pharaoh or Caesar, and states that
thirteen<br>
potentates bearing that title had "reigned" between the formation
of the<br>
confederacy and the discovery of America by Columbus. The
duration of<br>
each of these reigns he computes, absurdly enough, at exactly
fifty<br>
years, which, however, would give altogether a term of only six
hundred<br>
and fifty years. He supposes the discovery of America to have
taken<br>
place during the reign of the thirteenth Atotarho; and he adds
that the<br>
conquest and dispersion of the Eries occurred "about this time."
The<br>
latter event, as we know, took place in 1656. It is evident
that<br>
Cusick's chronology is totally at fault. As an Iroquois chief was
never<br>
succeeded by his son, but often by his brother, it is by no
means<br>
improbable that thirteen persons may have held successively the
title of<br>
Atotarho in the term of nearly two centuries, between the years
1459 and<br>
1656.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Heckewelder, in his well-known work on the
"History,<br>
Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations." cites a passage from
a<br>
manuscript book of his predecessor, the Rev. C. Pyrlaeus,
formerly<br>
missionary among the Mohawks, from which a comparatively recent
date<br>
would be inferred for the confederation. The inference, however,
is<br>
probably due to a mistake of Heckewelder himself. The passage, as
it<br>
stands in his volume, [Footnote: P. 56 of the revised edition of
1875,<br>
published by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.] is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Rev. C. Pyrlaeus, in his manuscript book, p. 234, says:
'The<br>
alliance or confederacy of the Five Nations was established, as
near as<br>
can be conjectured, one age (or the length of a man's life)
before the<br>
white people (the Dutch) came into the country. Thannawage was
the name<br>
of the aged Indian, a Mohawk, who first proposed such an
alliance.'"</p>

<p>The words which Heckewelder has here included between
parentheses arc<br>
apparently explanations which he himself added to the original
statement<br>
of Pyrlaeus. The first of these glosses, by which an "age" is
explained<br>
to be the length of a man's life, is doubtless correct; but the
second,<br>
which identifies the "white people" of Pyrlaeus with the Dutch,
is<br>
probably wrong. The white people who first "came into the
country" of<br>
the Huron-Iroquois nations were the French, under Cartier. It was
in the<br>
summer of 1535 that the bold Breton navigator, with three
vessels<br>
commissioned to establish a colony in Canada, entered the St.
Lawrence,<br>
and ascended the great river as far as the sites of Quebec and
Montreal.<br>
He spent the subsequent winter at Quebec. The presence of
this<br>
expedition, with its soldiers and sailors of strange complexion
and<br>
armed with terrible weapons, must have been known to all the
tribes<br>
dwelling along the river, and would naturally make an epoch in
their<br>
chronology. Assuming the year 1535 as the time when the white
people<br>
first "came into the country," and taking "the length of a man's
life"<br>
at seventy-five years (or three generations) we should arrive at
the<br>
year 1460 as the date of the formation of the Iroquois<br>
League. [Footnote: There is an evident difference between the
expression<br>
used by my Onondaga informants and that which is quoted by
Heckewelder<br>
from Pyrlaeus. The latter speaks of the time before the white
people<br>
"came into the country;" the Onondagas referred to the time
before they<br>
"came to these parts." The passage cited from Bancroft seems to
indicate<br>
that the white men of Hudson's crew presented no novel or
startling<br>
aspect to the Mohawks. The French had been "in the country"
before<br>
them.]</p>

<p>The brief period allowed by Heckewelder's version is on many
accounts<br>
inadmissible. If, when the Dutch first came among the Iroquois,
the<br>
confederacy had existed for only about eighty years, there must
have<br>
been many persons then living who had personally known some of
its<br>
founders. It is quite inconceivable that the cloud of
mythological<br>
legends which has gathered around the names of these founders&mdash;of
which<br>
Clark, in his "Onondaga," gives only the smaller portion&mdash;should
have<br>
arisen in so short a term. Nor is it probable that in so brief a
period<br>
as has elapsed since the date suggested by Heckewelder, a fourth
part of<br>
the names of the fifty chiefs who formed the first council would
have<br>
become unintelligible, or at least doubtful in meaning.
Schoolcraft, who<br>
was inclined to defer to Heckewelder's authority on this point,
did so<br>
with evident doubt and perplexity. "We cannot," he says,
"without<br>
rejecting many positive traditions of the Iroquois themselves,
refuse to<br>
concede a much earlier period to the first attempts of these
interesting<br>
tribes to form a general political association." [Footnote:
"<i>Notes on<br>
the Iroquois</i> p. 75,"]</p>

<p>In view of all the facts there seems no reason for withholding
credence<br>
from the clear and positive statement of the Iroquois
chroniclers, who<br>
place the commencement of their confederate government at about
the<br>
middle of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p><br>
NOTE D.</p>

<p>THE HIAWATHA MYTHS.</p>

<p>While many of the narratives of preternatural events recounted
by Clark,<br>
Schoolcraft and others, in which the name of Hiawatha occurs, are
merely<br>
adaptations of older myths relating to primitive Iroquois or
Algonkin<br>
deities, there are a few which are actual traditions, though
much<br>
confused and distorted, of incidents that really occurred. Among
these<br>
is the story told by Clark, of the marvelous bird by which
Hiawatha's<br>
only daughter was destroyed. Longfellow has avoided all reference
to<br>
this preposterous tale; but to Mr. Clark, if we may judge from
the<br>
fullness and solemnity with which he has recorded it, it appeared
very<br>
impressive. [Footnote: <i>"Onondaga"</i> Vol. I, p. 25.]
 According to<br>
his narrative, when the great convention assembled at the summons
of<br>
Hiawatha, to form the league of the Five Nations, he came to it
in<br>
company with his darling and only daughter, a girl of twelve.
Suddenly a<br>
loud rushing sound was heard. A dark spot appeared in the sky.
Hiawatha<br>
warned his daughter to be prepared for the coming doom from the
Great<br>
Spirit, and she meekly bowed in resignation. The dark spot,
rapidly<br>
descending, became an immense bird, which, with long and pointed
beak<br>
and wide-extended wings, swept down upon the beautiful girl, and
crushed<br>
her to atoms. Many other incidents are added, and we are told,
what we<br>
might well believe, that the hero's grief for the loss so
suddenly and<br>
frightfully inflicted upon him was intense and long
protracted.</p>

<p>That a story related with so much particularity should be
utterly<br>
without foundation did not appear probable. It seemed not
unlikely that<br>
a daughter of Hiawatha might have been killed at some public
meeting,<br>
either accidentally or purposely, and possibly by an Indian
belonging to<br>
one of the bird clans, the Snipe, the Heron, or the Crane. But
further<br>
inquiry showed that even this conjecture involved more of what
may be<br>
styled mythology than the simple facts called for. The Onondaga
chiefs<br>
on the Canadian Reserve, when asked if they had heard anything
about a<br>
strange bird causing the death of Hiawatha's daughter, replied at
once<br>
that the event was well known. As they related it, the occurrence
became<br>
natural and intelligible. It formed, indeed, a not unimportant
link in<br>
the chain of events which led to the establishment of the<br>
confederacy. The catastrophe, for such it truly was, took place
not at<br>
the great assembly which met for the formation of the league, but
at one<br>
of the Onondaga councils which were convened prior to that
meeting, and<br>
before Hiawatha had fled to the Caniengas. The council was held
in an<br>
open plain, encircled by a forest, near which temporary lodges
had been<br>
erected for the Councillors and their attendants. Hiawatha was
present,<br>
accompanied by his daughter, the last surviving member of his<br>
family. She was married, but still lived with her father, after
the<br>
custom of the people; for the wife did not join her husband in
his own<br>
home until she had borne him a child. The discussions had lasted
through<br>
the day, and at nightfall the people retired to their lodges.
Hiawatha's<br>
daughter had been out, probably with other women, into the
adjacent<br>
woods, to gather their light fuel of dry sticks for cooking. She
was<br>
great with child, and moved slowly, with her faggot, across
the<br>
sward. An evil eye was upon her. Suddenly the loud voice of
Atotarho was<br>
heard, shouting that a strange bird was in the air, and bidding
one of<br>
his best archers shoot it. The archer shot, and the bird fell. A
sudden<br>
rush took place from all quarters toward it, and in the rush
Hiawatha's<br>
daughter was thrown down and trampled to death. No one could
prove that<br>
Atotarho had planned this terrible blow at his great adversary,
but no<br>
one doubted it. Hiawatha's grief was profound; but it was
then,<br>
according to the tradition of the Canadian Onondagas,&mdash;when the
last tie<br>
of kindred which bound him to his own people was broken,&mdash;that
the idea<br>
occurred to him of seeking aid among the eastern nations.
[Footnote:<br>
This account of the events which immediately preceded Hiawatha's
flight<br>
differs somewhat from the narrative which I received from the New
York<br>
Onondagas, as recorded in the Introduction (p. 22). The
difference,<br>
however, is not important; and possibly, if it had occurred to me
to<br>
inquire of these latter informants about the incident of the
bird, I<br>
might have heard from them particulars which would have brought
the two<br>
versions of the story still nearer to accord. The notable fact is
that<br>
the reports of a tradition preserved for four hundred years, in
two<br>
divisions of a broken tribe, which have been widely separated for
more<br>
than a century, should agree so closely in all important<br>
particulars. Such concurrence of different chroniclers in the
main<br>
narrative of an event, with some diversity in the details, is
usually<br>
regarded as the best evidence of the truth of the history.]</p>

<p>Clark's informants also told him much about a snow-white canoe
in which<br>
Hiawatha&mdash;or, rather, Ta-oun-ya-wa-tha&mdash;made his first appearance
to<br>
human eyes. In this canoe the demigod was seen on Lake
Ontario,<br>
approaching the shore at Oswego. In it he ascended the river and
its<br>
various branches, removing all obstructions, and destroying all
enemies,<br>
natural and preternatural. And when his work was completed by
the<br>
establishment of the League, the hero, in his human form of
Hiawatha,<br>
seated himself in this canoe, and ascended in it to heaven, amid
"the<br>
sweetest melody of celestial music."</p>

<p>The nucleus and probable origin of this singular story is
perhaps to be<br>
found in the simple fact that Hiawatha, after his flight from
the<br>
Onondagas, made his appearance among the Caniengas a solitary
voyager,<br>
in a canoe, in which he had floated down the Mohawk river. The
canoes of<br>
the Caniengas were usually made of elm-bark, the birch not being
common<br>
in their country. If Hiawatha, as is not unlikely, had found
or<br>
constructed a small canoe of birch-bark on the upper waters of
the<br>
stream, and used it for his voyage to the Canienga town, it
might<br>
naturally attract some attention. The great celebrity and high
position<br>
which he soon attained, and the important work which he
accomplished,<br>
would cause the people who adopted him as a chief to look back
upon all<br>
the circumstances of his first arrival among them with
special<br>
interest. That the canoe was preserved till his death, and that
he was<br>
buried in it, amid funeral wails and mournful songs from a
vast<br>
multitude, such as had never before lamented a chief of the
Kanonsioani,<br>
may be deemed probable enough; and in these or some similar
events we<br>
may look for the origin of this beautiful myth, which reappears,
with<br>
such striking effect, in the closing scene of Longfellow's
poem.</p>

NOTE E.</p>

<p>THE IROQUOIS TOWNS.</p>

<p>The list of towns comprised in the text contains twenty-three
names. Of<br>
this number only eight or nine resemble names which have been in
use<br>
since the Five Nations were known to the whites; and even of this
small<br>
number it is not certain that all, or indeed any, were in these
more<br>
recent times applied to their original localities. My friend,
General<br>
John S. Clark, of Auburn, N. Y., who has made a special study of
the<br>
positions of the Indian tribes and villages, and whose notes on
this<br>
subject illustrate the excellent work of Dr. Hawley on the early
history<br>
of the Cayuga nation, [Footnote: <i>Early Chapters of Cayuga<br>
History:</i> By Charles Hawley, D.D., President of the Cayuga
Historical<br>
Society.]  has favored me, in a recent letter, with the following
brief<br>
but valuable summary of what is known in regard to the Iroquois
towns:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the Mohawks were first known, they occupied three
principal towns<br>
on the south side of the Mohawk river, between Ganajoharie and
Schoharie<br>
creeks. The most eastern was that of the "Turtles" (or Tortoise
clan),<br>
and was usually designated as such, and by the Dutch as the Lower
or<br>
First Castle. The Middle or Second Castle was commonly termed
the<br>
village of the "Bears;" while the Third or Upper Castle was
generally<br>
called Teonnondoge or Tionnontogen, a name apparently having
reference<br>
to the 'two mountains' near which the original town stood. After
these<br>
towns were destroyed by the French, in 1666, their people removed
to the<br>
north side of the river,&mdash;those of the lower town retreating a
few miles<br>
up the stream to the rapids; and then for a hundred years this
was<br>
generally known Caughnawaga (<i>Kahnawake</i>) "At the Rapids."
The<br>
Middle or Second Castle was called Gandagaro in 1670, Kanagiro in
1744,<br>
etc. The third appears to have retained its old name in all
positions."</p>

<p>"When the Oneidas were first known they occupied a position on
the<br>
headwaters of the Oneida inlet, and afterward gradually drew
northward<br>
toward the lake. Their great town was usually called by the name
of the<br>
tribe, as Onneiot, Onoyut, etc. One site, occupied about 1700,
was<br>
called and known generally as Kanowaroghare, said to signify 'a
head on<br>
a pole.'"</p>

<p>"The Onondagas, first known in 1615, occupied several sites,
from a<br>
point south of the east end of Oneida lake, where they were when
first<br>
known, to the Onondaga valley; but in all cases the chief town,
when<br>
named, was called Onondaga, from the name of the tribe. Their
great<br>
village in the Onondaga valley, according to Zeisberger, was
known in<br>
1750 as Tagochsanagecht, but this was a form derived from the
name of<br>
the Onondagas as used in council. In all ages this chief town,
wherever<br>
located, had other minor towns within from two to five miles, but
they<br>
are rarely named. The great town was also divided into districts,
one<br>
for each clan, each of which must have been known by the clan
name, but<br>
this is seldom referred to. This rule held good also in all the
large<br>
towns. A 'Bear village' was not occupied exclusively by members
of the<br>
Bear clan; but these predominated and exercised authority."</p>

<p>"The Cayugas in 1656 occupied three villages,&mdash;Onnontare, on a
hill near<br>
the Canandaigua river,&mdash;Thiohero, near the foot of Cayuga lake
('By the<br>
Marsh,' or, 'Where the Rushes are'),&mdash;and a third, which
generally took<br>
the name of the tribe, Cayuga, but was occasionally divided into
three<br>
districts, like the other large towns."</p>

<p>"The Senecas, when visited by the Jesuits, occupied two great
towns, and<br>
several minor villages. The eastern of the two towns, near
Victor, was<br>
called Gandougarae. The western, on Honcoye creek, nearly always,
in all<br>
localities, took the name of the stream, which signifies
'bending.' It<br>
is said that when the League was first formed, it was agreed that
the<br>
two great Seneca towns should be called by the names of two
principal<br>
sachems; but I am unable to find that this was carried out in<br>
practice. In La Hontan's narrative of the De Nonville expedition,
the<br>
great western town was separated into two parts, Thegaronhies
and<br>
Danoncaritowi, which were the names of two important chiefs;
while De<br>
Nonville's and other accounts describe it as Totiakton, 'at the
bend.'<br>
This discrepancy, however, is found in all cases where the
several towns<br>
are mentioned, as it was quite common to speak of them by the
name of<br>
the principal chief. Thus, Cayuga in 1750 was called Tagayu,
from<br>
Togahayu, the well-known chief sachem; Onondaga was called
Canasatago's<br>
town, etc."</p>

<p>The frequent changes in the positions and names of Indian
towns, thus<br>
well explained and exemplified, will account; for the fact that
so few<br>
of the ancient names in the list which the tenacious memories of
the<br>
record-keepers retained have come down in actual use to
modern<br>
times. The well-known landmark of the Oneida stone seems to
have<br>
preserved the name of the town,&mdash;<i>Onenyute,</i> "the
projecting<br>
rock,"&mdash;from which the nation derived its usual designation.<br>
<i>Deserokenh</i>, or, as the Jesuit missionaries wrote it,<br>
<i>Techiroguen</i>, was situated near the outlet of the Oneida
lake, at<br>
the point where the great northern trail crossed this outlet. A
village<br>
of some importance is likely to have been always found at or near
that<br>
locality. The same may be said of <i>Deyuhhero,</i> or
<i>Tiohero,</i><br>
where the main trail which united all the cantons crossed the
river<br>
outlet of Lake Cayuga.</p>

<p>In other cases, though the identity of names is clear, that of
the<br>
localities is more doubtful. The <i>Kaneghsadakeh</i> of the
list, the<br>
"Hill-side town," may be the <i>Kanasadaga</i> of the Senecas;
but, as<br>
General Clark remarks, the name might have been applied to any
town on<br>
the side of a mountain. In like manner <i>Deyughsweken</i>
(or<br>
<i>Deyohsweken</i>), which is said to mean "flowing out," may
have been<br>
the town from which the Oswego river took its name, or a town at
the<br>
mouth of any other river; and <i>Deyaokenh,</i> "the Forks," may
have<br>
been Tioga, or any other village at the junction of two<br>
streams. <i>Fonondese</i> ("it is a high hill") is perhaps the
same name<br>
as Onontare, which in Charlevoix's map appears as
Onnontatacet;<br>
[Footnote: See <i>"Early Chapters of Cayuga History,"</i> p. 48.]
but<br>
the name may well have been a common one. A few other
apparent<br>
coincidences might be pointed out; but of most of the towns in
the list<br>
we can only say that no trace remains in name or known locality,
and<br>
that in some cases even the meaning of the names has ceased to
be<br>
remembered. General Clark sums up his conclusions on this point
in the<br>
following words: "They appear to belong to a remote&mdash;I may say a
very<br>
remote&mdash;age, and not to be referred to any particular known
localities;<br>
and this, as it appears to me, is more to the credit of the
manuscript<br>
as an archaic work."</p>

<p><br>
NOTE F.</p>

<p>THE PRE-ARYAN RACE IN EUROPE AND AMERICA.</p>

<p>[The following is the concluding portion of an essay on
"Indian<br>
Migrations, as evidenced by Language," which was read at the
Montreal<br>
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, in<br>
August, 1882, and published in the "American Antiquarian" for
January<br>
and April, 1883. As the views set forth in this extract have a
bearing<br>
on the subjects discussed in the present work, the author takes
the<br>
opportunity of reproducing them here for the consideration of
its<br>
readers.]</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the evidence of language, and to some
extent<br>
that of tradition, leads to the conclusion that the course of
migration<br>
of the Indian tribes has been from the Atlantic coast westward
and<br>
southward. The Huron-Iroquois tribes had their pristine seat on
the<br>
lower St. Lawrence. The traditions of the Algonkins seem to point
to<br>
Hudson's Bay and the coast of Labrador. The Dakota stock had its
oldest<br>
branch east of the Alleghenies, and possibly (if the Catawba
nation<br>
shall be proved to be of that stock), on the Carolina<br>
coast. Philologists are well aware that there is nothing in the
language<br>
of the American Indians to favor the conjecture (for it is
nothing else)<br>
which derives the race from eastern Asia. But in western Europe
one<br>
community is known to exist, speaking a language which in its
general<br>
structure manifests a near likeness to the Indian tongues. Alone
of all<br>
the races of the old continent the Basques or Euskarians of
northern<br>
Spain and southwestern France have a speech of that highly
complex and<br>
polysynthetic character which distinguishes the American<br>
languages. There is not, indeed, any such positive similarity, in
words<br>
or grammar, as would prove a direct affiliation. The likeness is
merely<br>
in the general cast and mould of speech; but this likeness is so
marked<br>
as to have awakened much attention. If the scholars who have
noticed it<br>
had been aware of the facts now adduced with regard to the course
of<br>
migration on this continent, they would probably have been led to
the<br>
conclusion that this similarity in the type of speech was an
evidence of<br>
the unity of race. There seems reason to believe that Europe&mdash;at
least<br>
in its southern and western portions&mdash;was occupied in early times
by a<br>
race having many of the characteristics, physical and mental, of
the<br>
American aborigines. The evidences which lead to this conclusion
are<br>
well set forth in Dr. Dawson's recent work on "Fossil Man." Of
this<br>
early European people, by some called the Iberian race, who
were<br>
ultimately overwhelmed by the Aryan emigrants from central Asia,
the<br>
Basques are the only survivors that have retained their
original<br>
language; but all the nations of southern Europe, commencing with
the<br>
Greeks, show in their physical and mental traits a large
intermixture of<br>
this aboriginal race. As we advance westward, the evidence of
this<br>
infusion becomes stronger, until in the Celts of France and of
the<br>
British Islands it gives the predominant cast to the character of
the<br>
people. [Footnote: "The Basque may then be the sole surviving
relic and<br>
witness of an aboriginal western European population,
dispossessed by<br>
the intrusive Indo-European tribes. It stands entirely alone, no
kindred<br>
having yet been found for it in any part of the world. It is of
an<br>
exaggeratedly agglutinative type, incorporating into its verb a
variety<br>
of relations which are almost everywhere else expressed by an<br>
independent word."&mdash;"The Basque forms a suitable stepping-stone
from<br>
which to enter the peculiar linguistic domain of the New World,
since<br>
there is no other dialect of the Old World which so much
resembles in<br>
structure the American languages."&mdash;Professor Whitney, in <i>"The
Life<br>
and Growth of Language"</i> p. 258.]</p>

<p>If the early population of Europe were really similar to that
of<br>
America, then we may infer that it was composed of many
tribes,<br>
scattered in loose bands over the country, and speaking languages
widely<br>
and sometimes radically different, but all of a polysynthetic<br>
structure. They were a bold, proud, adventurous people, good
hunters and<br>
good sailors. In the latter respect they were wholly unlike
the<br>
primitive Aryans, who, as was natural in a pastoral people of
inland<br>
origin, have always had in the east a terror of the ocean, and in
Europe<br>
were, within historic times, the clumsiest and least venturous
of<br>
navigators. If communities resembling the Iroquois and the Caribs
once<br>
inhabited the British islands and the western coasts of the
adjacent<br>
continent, we may be sure that their fleets of large canoes, such
as<br>
have been exhumed from the peat-deposits and ancient river-beds
of<br>
Ireland, Scotland, and France, swarmed along all the shores
and<br>
estuaries of that region. Accident or adventure may easily have
carried<br>
some of them across the Atlantic, not merely once, but in
many<br>
successive emigrations from different parts of western Europe.
The<br>
distance is less than that which the canoes of the Polynesians
were<br>
accustomed to traverse. The derivation of the American population
from<br>
this source presents no serious improbability whatever.
[Footnote: The<br>
distance from Ireland to Newfoundland is only sixteen hundred
miles. The<br>
distance from the Sandwich Islands to Tahiti (whence the natives
of the<br>
former group affirm that their ancestors came) is twenty-two
hundred<br>
miles. The distance from the former islands to the Marquesas
group, the<br>
nearest inhabited land, is seventeen hundred miles. The canoes of
the<br>
Sandwich Islands (as we are assured by Ellis, in his
<i>"Polynesian<br>
Researches"</i>) "seldom exceed fifty feet in length." In the
river-beds<br>
of France, ancient canoes have been found, exceeding forty feet
in<br>
length. One was more than forty-five feet long, and nearly four
feet<br>
deep. See the particulars in Figuier's <i>"Primitive
Man,"</i><br>
Appleton's edit., p. 177. See also Prof. D. Wilson's
<i>"Prehistoric<br>
Man,"</i> 2d edit., p. 102, for a full discussion of this
question, with<br>
instances of long canoe voyages.]</p>

<p>On the theory which seems thus rendered probable, that the
early<br>
Europeans were of the same race as the Indians of America, we are
able<br>
to account for certain characteristics of the modern nations of
Europe,<br>
which would otherwise present to the student of anthropology
a<br>
perplexing problem. The Aryans of Asia, ancient and modern, as we
know<br>
them in the Hindoos, the Persians, and the Armenians, with the
evidence<br>
afforded by their history, their literature and their present
condition,<br>
have always been utterly devoid of the sentiment of political<br>
rights. The love of freedom is a feeling of which they seem<br>
incapable. To humble themselves before some superior
power&mdash;deity, king,<br>
or brahmin&mdash;seems to be with them a natural and overpowering<br>
inclination. Next to this feeling is the love of contemplation
and of<br>
abstract reasoning. A dreamy life of worship and thought is the
highest<br>
felicity of the Asiatic Aryan. On the other hand, if the
ancient<br>
Europeans were what the Basques and the American Indians are now,
they<br>
were a people imbued with the strongest possible sense of
personal<br>
independence, and, resulting from that, a passion for political
freedom.<br>
They were also a shrewd, practical, observant people, with little
taste<br>
for abstract reasoning.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that from a mingling of two races of such
opposite<br>
dispositions, a people of mixed character would be formed, very
similar<br>
to that which has existed in Europe since the advent of the
Aryan<br>
emigrants. In eastern Europe, among the Greeks and Sclavonians,
where<br>
the Iberian element would be weakest, the Aryan characteristics
of<br>
reverence and contemplation would be most apparent. As we
advance<br>
westward, among the Latin and Teutonic populations, the sense
of<br>
political rights, the taste for adventure, and the observing,
practical<br>
tendency, would be more and more manifest; until at length, among
the<br>
western Celts, as among the American Indians, the love of freedom
would<br>
become exalted to an almost morbid distrust of all governing
authority.</p>

<p>If this theory is correct, the nations of modern Europe have
derived<br>
those traits of character and those institutions which have given
them<br>
their present headship of power and civilization among the
peoples of<br>
the globe, not from their Aryan forefathers, but mainly from this
other<br>
portion of their ancestry, belonging to the earlier population
which the<br>
Aryans overcame and absorbed. That this primitive population
was<br>
tolerably numerous is evident from the fact that the Aryans,<br>
particularly of the Latin, Teutonic, and Celtic nations lost
in<br>
absorbing it many vocal elements and many grammatical inflections
of<br>
their speech. They gained, at the same time, the self-respect,
the love<br>
of liberty, and the capacity for selfgovernment, which were
unknown to<br>
them in their Asiatic home. Knowing that these characteristics
have<br>
always marked the American race, we need not be surprised when
modern<br>
researches demonstrate the fact that many of our Indian
communities have<br>
had political systems embodying some of the most valuable
principles of<br>
popular government. We shall no longer feel inclined to question
the<br>
truth of the conclusion which has been announced by Carli,
Draper, and<br>
other philosophic investigators, who affirm that the Spaniards,
in their<br>
conquest of Mexico, Yucatan, and Peru, destroyed a better form
of<br>
society than that which they established in its place. The
intellectual<br>
but servile Aryans will cease to attract the undue admiration
which they<br>
have received for qualities not their own; and we shall look with
a new<br>
interest on the remnant of the Indian race, as possibly
representing<br>
this nobler type of man, whose inextinguishable love of freedom
has<br>
evoked the idea of political rights, and has created those
institutions<br>
of regulated self-government by which genuine civilization and
progress<br>
are assured to the world.</p>

<p>CANIENGA GLOSSARY.</p>

<p>The following Glossary comprises all the words of the Canienga
text. The<br>
meanings of these words are given as they were, received from
the<br>
interpreters. For most of them these definitions are confirmed by
the<br>
dictionaries of Bruyas and Cuoq. Some of the words, which are
either<br>
archaic forms or peculiar to the Council ceremonies, are not
found in<br>
those dictionaries; and in a few instances the precise purport of
these<br>
words must be considered doubtful. In some cases, also, the force
of a<br>
grammatical inflection or of an affix may not have been
correctly<br>
ascertained; but it is believed that the vocabulary will be
found, in<br>
general, sufficiently accurate to be of service to the student
who may<br>
desire to acquire some knowledge of the Canienga speech.</p>

<p>When the words of John Buck's copy differ in orthography from
those of<br>
the Johnson MS., the former are added in brackets. Words cited

End of Project Gutenberg's The Iroquois Book of Rites, by Horatio Hale

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IROQUOIS BOOK OF RITES ***

This file should be named 8irbr10h.htm or 8irbr10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8irbr11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8irbr10ah.htm

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     eBook or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
