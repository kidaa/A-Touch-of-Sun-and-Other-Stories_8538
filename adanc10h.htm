<h2>
To Mr. Isaac.</h2>

<h3>
SIR,</h3>
Tho' <i>Dancing</i> and <i>Musick</i> seem to be of near an equal Antiquity,
and even of an equal Extent, yet <i>Musick</i> has long receiv'd an Advantage,
which <i>Dancing</i> wanted. <i>Musick</i> has employ'd the Pens of many
of the Learned, both Ancient and Modern, and has had the Benefit of an
universal Character, which convey'd the harmonious Compositions to all
Lovers of the <i>Art</i> in all Nations. <i>Dancing</i>, on the contrary,
tho' celebrated by Ancient Authors in an extraordinary manner, and with
uncommon Praises, (as I shall shew in a Treatise, which I shall suddenly
publish on that Subject) yet among the Moderns, it has been wholly unknown
to the Learned, and destitute of all Pens, in either the speculative or
practick part of the <i>Art</i>, which for want of an universal Character,
was confin'd to the immediate Master and Scholar, or at farthest, to a
narrow traditional Instruction, which none could participate of without
a Teacher, who had been taught by some other, either Composer, or Scholar
of such Composer. This Inconvenience at length stirr'd up Monsieur <i>Beauchamp</i>
to begin what Monsieur <i>Feuillet</i> accomplish'd in the following Treatise,
which tho' for some time enjoy'd by the <i>French</i> Nation, as a native
Growth,
<i>now first appears</i> in its true and just Extent in its Transplantation
into the <i>English</i> Climate and Language.
<p>The Service to the Lovers and Professors of this <i>Art</i>, having
been the chief Motive of my Undertaking so difficult a Province, that we
who enjoy the Happiness of so Great a Master as Mr. <i>Isaac</i>, should
not want the Advantage of spreading that Excellence in this <i>Art</i>,
which renders him so admir'd by all who have any Taste of it; so having
receiv'd such great and generous Encouragement in this Study from you,
Sir; the Product of that Encouragement and Study does, as it were, out
of a natural Right and just Gratitude, seek Shelter under your Patronage,
and challenge the Advantage of appearing in the World under the Protection
of your Name, whole known Judgment and Mastery in this <i>Art</i>, will
secure me from the Censure of Malice and Ignorance.
<p>However, I shall have little to fear, if I am so happy as to merit that
generous Assistance, which you have been pleased to give me in the compiling
of this Book; and I am apt to flatter my self, that I have done the Original
that Justice, that the Author will have no Reason to complain: But whatever
Defects I may have been guilty of in it, I promise my self Forgiveness
from so much Goodness and Candor, as all People (with Justice) allow to
Mr. <i>Isaac</i>. You are so truly distinguish'd from most Men, by a peculiar
Sincerity and Zeal for the Service of your Friend, or him whom you have
once thought fit to espouse, that as I have done nothing but comply'd with
my own Inclination, in offering this publick Acknowledgment of your Favour,
so I have infinite Cause of being perfectly satisfy'd with my Patron.
<p>I know it is the Custom of <i>Dedicators</i>, to launch forth into the
Praises of the Virtues and Parts of their Patrons; but I know Mr. <i>Isaac</i>
too well, to think I can render my self more acceptable to him, by entertaining
him with his own Deserts, since they are too well known to all your Acquaintance,
to need a Publication in this place. Not but that it would be a Theme infinitely
grateful to me; but I shall curb that Inclination, and deny my self a Pleasure
that would be disgustful to you. It is enough, that by spreading the Knowledge
which the following Book conveys, your Excellence in the <i>Art</i>, your
admirable Compositions will more easily, and more largely encrease the
Number of your Admirers; among which, there never will be one more truly
devoted to your Service, than,
<p><i>SIR,</i>
<p><i>Your most Obliged Humble Servant</i>,
<p>John Weaver.

PREFACE.</h2>
<i>I Perswade my self, that before so useful a Curiosity as the following
Treatise, it would not be disagreeable to the Reader, to give him an Account
of the Origin and Progress of the Art of</i> Orchesography. Furetier, <i>in
his Historical Dictionary, tells us of a curious Treatise of this Art by
one</i> Thoinet Arbeau, <i>printed 1588, at</i> Langres, <i>from whom Monsieur</i>
Feuillet, <i>in his Preface, supposes this Art to date its first Rise and
Birth, tho' he could never procure a Sight of it, as not to be found in</i>
Paris. <i>But this very Book falling into my Hands, I took Care to peruse
it with some Attention, but found it far short of that Expectation, which
such Recommendation had rais'd in me: For tho' it might perhaps have given
the Hint to Mr</i>. Beauchamp; <i>yet it is nothing but an imperfect rough
Draught, nor if it confin'd to Dancing, since it treats besides of beating
the Drum, playing on the Pipe, and the like.</i>
<p><i>But notwithstanding this blind Hint of</i> Arbeau, <i>to do Justice
to Mons.</i> Beauchamp, <i>we must attribute to him the Invention of this
Art, who in all Probability, could no more see the former Book, than Mons.</i>
Feuillet. <i>But as no Art was ever invented and perfected at once; so
it remain'd for Mons</i>. Feuillet, <i>to raise the compleat and finish'd
Superstructure on Mons</i>. Beauchamp's <i>Foundation; and it must be allowed,
that Mons</i>. Feuillet <i>has carry'd this Art to a very great Perfection,
and taken a great deal of Pains in the Improvement of the Character, and
given Rules so just, and a Method so proper, that I cannot imagine any
Man can flatter himself with an Ability of designing a better, or more
regular manner. For this Reason I chose rather to follow his Method entirely,
than attempt any Alteration of my own, which I have done with that Care
and Diligence, that I think I may assure the Reader I have omitted nothing
that he has deliver'd. I have also made it my Business</i> to bring the
Reader acquainted with the Meaning of my Author, as well as his Words,
which is a Happiness every Translator has not the Power of arriving at,
as generally either ignorant of the Subject or Language he translates from,
or into, or both.
<p>Another Fault of our common Translators I have avoided with all the
Industry I could: Some of them pretending to meddle with Books of Art,
and not understanding the Terms of Art, give us such an odd Jargon, that
we can never understand it without the Interpretation of a Master, or having
Recourse to the Original itself. I have therefore render'd all the French
<i>Terms
into</i> English<i>, but with so much Caution of doing Justice to the Author,
and the Art, that I would not defend on my own Judgment, but let none pass
without the Approbation of the best</i> English <i>Masters.</i>
<p><i>The Perfection, which Dancing is now come to in</i> England<i>, seems
to point this Time out at the fittest Juncture, for the Publication of
a Book of this Nature; since we now enjoy in this Nation, Performers and
Masters of greater Excellence than any other part of</i> Europe<i>; who
shew every Beauty of the Art in its full Glory and Perfection. For whoever
shall consider the Masterly Compositions of Ball-Dances by Mr.</i> Isaac<i>,
which are so well adapted to the manner of our School-teaching, (peculiar
to</i> England<i>, no other Nation having any such thing as publick Dancing-Schools)
whoever shall see the admirable Compositions of Mons.</i> L'Abbe <i>in
Ballet, and his Performance, with that of M.</i> Desbargues<i>, M.</i>
Du Ruel<i>, and M.</i> Cherrier<i>, can hope to see nothing in this Art
of greater Excellence, unless any wonderful Genius should arise, and advance
this once celebrated Art to that Perfection, which drew the Eyes, and employ'd
the Pens of the old</i> Greeks <i>and</i> Romans<i>; a lively Description
of which, the Reader may see in this</i> Epigram<i>, by an unknown Hand</i>
<blockquote>Mascula foemineo derivans Pectora Sexu,
<br>Atq; aptans lentum Sexum at utrumq; latus,
<br>Egressus Scenam Populum faltator adorat
<br>Solerti pendet predere verba Manu.
<br>Nam cum grata Chorus diffundit cantica dulcis
<br>Qu&aelig; resonat Cantor, motibus ipse probat.
<br>Pugnat, ludit, amat, Bacchatur, Vertitur, adstat,
<br>Illustrat verum, cuncta decore replet.
<br>Tot Lingu&aelig;, quot Membra viro, Mirabilis est Ars,
<br>Qu&aelig; facit Articulos voce silente loqui.</blockquote>
<i>From this Epigram, it is plain, that the ancient Dancing had something
more than Motion, Measure, and Figure, and express'd the Passions and Actions
of Mankind, was a sort os silent Poetry, and the Painting, tho' without
Colours, so expressive, as to touch and charm every Beholder.</i>
<p><i>There will be no need to enforce the Use of this Art, and by Consequence
recommend the Book that teaches it, to all Lovers of Dancing, since it
carries its own Evidence with it self, and has already convinc'd them of
its Benefit and Advantage; and I question not but others will find the
same Satisfaction from their Study, which I have done, since by a close
Application to this Character, I have made such a Progress in it, as to
be able to communicate all Dances to the rest of the Profession at any
Distance. I have a great deal of Reason to believe, that had not I first
undertaken to make Mons.</i>Feuillet <i>speak</i> English, <i>this Character
had yet a longer while remain'd a Secret to this Nation; those who had
made their private Market of it, not being willing to admit any Rivals
in an Art, which chiefly distinguish'd them from others of their Profession.</i>
<p><i>I must undeceive some, who may perhaps mistake the Design of the
following Treatise, and take it for an Instruction, or some Improvement
in the Art of Dancing, or Method of Teaching. But I must assure them, that
I am not yet Master of Vanity enough to venture upon a Task so difficult,
and so invidious, since I am of Opinion, that there are not better Masters
for instructing Scholars in a genteel Movement and Address, than the</i>
English.
<p><i>I shall not therefore detain the Reader any longer in the Porch,
but leave him now to enter, and improve</i>.

<h1 align=center>
The ART of DANCING</h1>
<p align=center>BY

<h3 align=center>
Characters and Demonstrative Figures.</h3>
<i>By which any Person, who understands Dancing, may of himself easily
learn all manner of </i>Dances.
<p>The Explanation of the Terms belonging to <i>DANCING</i>, seem to be
altogether needless, since they are so plain and intelligible of themselves:
But lest the Reader should put wrong Constructions on those <i>Terms</i>
of <i>Art</i> which the <i>Dancing-Masters</i> make use of, I shall give
the following <i>Explanation</i> of them.
<p><i>Dancing </i>is composed of<i> Positions, Steps, Sinkings, Risings,
Springings, Capers, Fallings, Slidings, Turnings </i>of the Body<i>, Cadence</i>
or<i> Time, Figures,</i> &amp;c.
<p><i>Positions,</i> are the different Placings of the Feet in Dancing.
<p><i>Steps, </i>are the Motions of the Feet from one place to another.
<p><i>Sinkings, </i>are the Bendings of the Knees.
<p><i>Risings, </i>are when we rise from a Sink, or erect our selves.
<p><i>Springing, </i>is a rising or leaping from the Ground.
<p><i>Capers, </i>are when in <i>rising</i> or leaping from the Ground,
one Leg beats against the other, which we call <i>Cutting.</i>
<p><i>Fallings, are </i>when the Body, being out of its proper Poise, falls
by its own Weight.
<p><i>Slidings,</i> are when<i>, in moving, </i>the Foot slides on the
Ground.
<p><i>Turnings, </i>are when the Body turns either one way or the other.
<p><i>Cadence or Time, </i>is a right understanding of the different Measures,
and Observation of the most remarkable places in the<i> Tune.</i>
<p><i>Figures, </i>are<i> Tracts </i>made by<i> Art, </i>on which the<i>
Dancer </i>is to move.
<p>Before I proceed to demonstrate what I have already explain'd, I shall
describe the<i> Room</i> or <i>Stage, </i>where<i> Dancing </i>is perform'd;
as also the different<i> Tracts </i>or<i> Figures </i>to be made thereon,
and the<i> Posture</i> and<i> Presence of the Body</i>, in which the<i>
Performer </i>ought to stand.

<h2 align=center>
Of the Stage, Room, or School.</h2>
The <i>Stage or Dancing-Room</i>, I shall represent by an <i>Oblong</i>,
as in the Figure A B C D, of which the upper end is A B, the lower end
C D; the right side B D, and the left side A C.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p12ABCD.png" height=391 width=365>

<h2 align=center>
The Presence of the Body.</h2>
The <i>Posture</i> or Presence of the Body, is to have respect to that
part of the <i>Room</i>, to which the Face or Fore-part of the Body is
directed, which I describe by the Figure F G H I, of which F G shews the
two Sides of the Body, H the Face or Fore-part, and I the Back or Hinder-part.

<h2 align=center>
Of the Tract.</h2>
The Line on which the Dances are described, I call the <i>Tract</i>.
<p>Which <i>Tract</i> serves for two Ends, the first to direct the <i>Steps</i>
and <i>Positions</i>, and the other to represent the Figure of the <i>Dance</i>.
<p>All <i>Steps</i> and <i>Positions</i> may be described upon two Lines,
<i>viz</i>.upon
a <i>Right</i> Line, and a <i>Diametrical</i> Line; but because the <i>Tract</i>
must also be made use of for the Explanation of the Figure of <i>Dances</i>,
I shall add to these Lines, the <i>Circular</i> and i>Oblique.
<p>A <i>Right Line</i>, I call that which extends it self in Length, from
one end of the <i>Room</i> to the other, as by the Line mark'd K.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p13Kline.png" height=230 width=200>
<p>A <i>Diametrical Line</i>, is that which goes cross the <i>Room from
side to side, as is shewn by the Line L.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p13Lline.png" height=253 width=200>
<br><i>The Circular Line,</i>
is that which goes round the<i> Room, </i>as is express'd by the Letter
M.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p14Mline.png" height=225 width=200>
<p>The<i> Oblique Line,</i> is that which goes cross the <i>Room, </i>from
Corner to Corner, as may be seen by the Line N.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p14Nline.png" height=225 width=200>
<br>Every one of these <i>Lines</i>,<i> </i>or<i> Tracts, </i>may jointly
or separately form the<i> Figure </i>of a<i> Dance, </i>on which may be
described the<i> Positions </i>and <i>Steps, </i>as in<i> Figure </i>O.
The beginning of which <i>Tract, </i>is shewn by the<i> Character </i>representing
the<i> Posture </i>or<i> Presence of the Body, </i>which must be join'd
to it, to shew the<i> Position </i>of the Body at the beginning of the<i>
Dance.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p14Oline.png" height=245 width=200>

<h2 align=center>
<i>Of the Positions.</i></h2>
There are ten Sorts of <i>Positions</i> generally us'd in <i>Dancing,</i>
which are divided into <i>True</i> and <i>False.</i>
<p>The<i> True</i>, are when the Feet are plac'd uniform, and have the
Toes turn'd out equally.
<p>The <i>False</i>, are some of them uniform, others not, and differ from
the <i>True</i>, in that, the Toes are turn'd inward, or one in, and the
other out.
<p>In all <i>Positions</i> whatsoever, the Form of the Foot is known by
these Marks, <i>viz.</i> That which resembles an O, represents the Heel;
the Line join'd to it, the Ankle; and the Extremity of that Line, the Point
of that Foot.
<p align=center><i>A half Position.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p15TAH.png" height=95 width=200>
<br>This Figure of the <i>Foot</i>, is but a half <i>Position,</i> because
it represents but one <i>Foot</i>, whereas a whole <i>Position</i> does
that of two, as in the Figure A B.
<p align=center><i>Position</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p15pos.png" height=100 width=138>
<br>'Tis to be observ'd, that the Letter A, in the foregoing Figure, represents
the left <i>Foot</i>, and B, the right.

<h2 align=center>
<i>Of true Positions.</i></h2>
There are five true <i>Positions</i>. The first is when the two Feet are
join'd together, the Heels being one against the other.
<i>First Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p16first.png" height=100 width=84>
<p>The second is when the Feet are open, or separate, on a Line, one distant
from the other the length of the Foot.
<i>Second Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p16secnd.png" height=100 width=87>
<p>The third is when the Heel of one Foot is join'd to the Ankle of the
other, which I shall hereafter term inclos'd.
<i>Third Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p16third.png" height=100 width=54>
<p>The fourth is when the two Feet are plac'd one before the other, the
distance of a Foot in length.
<i>Fourth Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p16fourt.png" height=100 width=76>
<p>The fifth is when the two Feet are cross'd, the Heel of one directly
opposite to the Toe of the other. Fifth Position.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p16fifth.png" height=100 width=56>

<h2 align=center>
<i>Of false Positions.</i></h2>
There are also five of these. The first is when the Toes are turn'd inwards,
and touch each other, the Heels being open on the Line.
<i>First Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p17first.png" height=100 width=88>
<p>The second is when the Toes are turn'd inwards, there being the distance
of a Foot's Length between the Toes; the Heels as before.
<i>Second Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p17second.png" height=80 width=139>
<p>The third is when the Toe of one Foot is outwards, and the other inwards,
the one parallel towards the other.
<i>Third Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p17third.png" height=100 width=74>
<p>The fourth is when the Toes are turn'd inwards, so that the Toe of one
Foot points to the Ankle of the other.
<i>Fourth Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p17fourt.png" height=100 width=57>
<p>The fifth false Position, is mark'd like the fifth true one, and seems
to be the same Position; but notwithstanding, they are very different,
for whereas in the true one, the Toes are turn'd outwards, in the false,
they are turn'd inwards, crossing each other, so that the Heel of one Foot
is right against the Toe of the other, and is to be distinguish'd from
the true one by a small Bar between the Position.
<i>Fifth Position.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img1/p17fifth.png" height=100 width=57>

<h2 align=center>
<i>Of Steps.</i></h2>
Altho' <i>Steps</i> made use of in Dancing, are almost innumerable, I shall
nevertheless reduce them to five, which serve to express the different
Figures the Leg makes in moving: These I shall call, <i>a straight plain
Step</i>, an <i>open Step</i>, a <i>circular</i> or <i>round Step</i>,
a <i>waving Step</i>, and a <i>beaten Step</i>.
<p>A <i>straight Step</i>, is when the Foot moves in a right Line; which
is to be made two ways, forwards, and backwards.
<p>The <i>open Step</i>, is when the Leg opens; which is to be done three
ways, one outwards, another inwards, both which make an Arch or half Circle,
and the third sideways, which may also be called a <i>straight Step</i>,
because the Motion of it is in a direct Line.
<p>The <i>round </i>or <i>circular</i> Step, is when the Foot, in moving,
makes a <i>circular Figure</i>; of this there is two ways, one outwards,
and another inwards.
<p>The <i>waving Step</i>, is when the Foot, in moving, turns both inwards
and outwards. There are three ways of doing this, forwards, backwards,
and sideways.
<p>The <i>beaten Step</i>, is when one Leg or Foot is beaten against the
other. Of this there are also three ways of performing, viz. forwards,
backwards, and sideways.
<p>A <i>Step</i> is known by the Character following, <i>viz</i>. a black
Spot mark'd A, representing the <i>Position</i> of the <i>Foot</i>, the
Line drawn from that Spot, mark'd B, shewing the <i>Motion, Figure</i>,
and
<i>Largness</i> of the <i>Step</i>, as from A to D, and lastly, by
a small side Stroke join'd to the End of the Line C, representing the Foot,
of which D is the Heel, and E the Point of the Foot, or Toe.

<i>How to place the Marks in their proper Order.</i></h2>
It is necessary first to know, that a <i>Step</i> has three Divisions,
<i>viz</i>.
a <i>Beginning, Middle</i>, and <i>End:</i> You must also consider the
<i>Foot,</i>
as well in <i>Steps</i> as <i>Positions,</i> has two Sides, an Inside and
an Outside. The Beginning of the <i>Step</i>, is the Beginning of the Line,
joining the little black Spot, as is shewn by the Letter A. The Middle,
is the middle of the Line, as at Letter B. And the End, is the Extremity
of the Line, joining that which represents the Foot, as at Letter C. The
Outside of the Foot, is between the Heel and the end of the little Toe,
mark'd D E; and the Inside, is that which is between the Heel and End of
the great Toe, as is mark'd F G.

There are three ways of <i>Sinking, viz</i>. before the Foot moves, in
moving, and after it has moved.
<p>When there is the Mark of a <i>Sink</i> at the beginning of a <i>Step</i>,
the <i>Sink</i> must be made before the Foot moves.

<i>Observations upon Springings.</i></h2>
<i>Springings</i> may be perform'd two ways,<i> viz</i>. with both Feet
at once, or with one Foot only.
<p>The <i>Springings</i> which are made on both Feet, are mark'd upon the
<i>Positions</i>,
as hereafter will appear; whereas the <i>Springings</i> that are made in
moving, are mark'd upon the <i>Steps</i>, as has been already shewn, and
will again appear by the Sequel.

<h2 align=center>
<i>Of Springing Steps.</i></h2>
A <i>Springing Step</i>, is perform'd two ways, either by <i>springing</i>
and <i>falling </i>on the same Foot which moves forward, which I shall,
for the future, call a <i>Bound;</i> or <i>springing</i> and <i>falling</i>
on the Foot that does not move forward, which I shall call a <i>Hop</i>.
<p>When there is a Mark of a <i>Spring</i> upon the <i>Step</i>, and no
Mark for the holding up of the Foot after it, it shews, that the <i>Spring</i>
is to be made with the <i>Foot</i> that moves, which is call'd a <i>Bound</i>
<p align=center><i>A Bound.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p26bound.png" height=100 width=29>
<p>But when there is a Mark for a <i>Spring</i>, and afterwards a Mark
for the <i>Foot </i>up, it signifies, that the <i>Spring</i> must be made
on the <i>Foot</i> that does not move forwards, which is call'd a <i>Hop.</i>
<p align=center><i>A Hop.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p26hop.png" height=100 width=26>
<p>The mark for <i>falling</i>, has no proper Place assign'd it, and I
shall only observe, that in <i>rising</i>, when it is in Order to <i>fall</i>,
it is necessary the Mark for a <i>Rise</i>, should be near the beginning
of the <i>Step</i>.
<p align=center><i>Rise and Fall.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p26rsfal.png" height=100 width=39>
<p>The mark for a <i>Slide</i>, has likewise no proper Place, when it is
single on a <i>Step</i>; but when it is accompanied with other Marks, as
<i>sinking,
rising</i>, &amp;c. then it must be plac'd last.
<p align=center><i>Sink, Rise, and Slide.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p26srsld.png" height=100 width=30>
<p>If after the Mark of a <i>Slide</i>, there be also the Mark for the
Foot up, you must <i>Slide</i> no farther than that Mark shewing the Foot
up.
<p align=center><i>Slide, and afterwards hold the Foot up.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p27shfu.png" height=100 width=38>
<p>The Mark for the <i>Foot up</i>, may be plac'd either in the Middle,
or the End; when it is in the Middle, it shews, that the Foot is only up,
in Order to be set down afterwards.
<p align=center><i>Foot up, and then put down.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p27fupd.png" height=100 width=36>
<p>But when it is at the End, it signifies, that the Foot must remain up.
<p align=center><i>Foot up.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p27ftup.png" height=100 width=40>
<p>To <i>point the Toe</i>, and afterwards the <i>Heel</i>, there must
be a Point on the outside of that which represents the <i>Toe</i>, and
another on the inside of that which represents the <i>Heel.</i>
<p align=center><i>To point the
Toe, and after to place the Heel.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p27ptphl.png" height=100 width=34>
<p>To <i>place the Heel</i>, and afterwards <i>point the Toe</i>, there
must be a point on the outside of that which represents the <i>Heel,</i>
and another on the inside of that which represents the <i>Toe</i>.
<p align=center><i>To
place the Heel, and afterwards point the Toe.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/P28phpt.png" height=100 width=30>
<p>It is to be observed, that in the two foregoing Examples, the Point
which is on the Outside of that which represents either the <i>Toe</i>
or <i>Heel</i>, is the Point from whence you must always begin.
<p>When there is a Point at the end of that which represents the<i> Toe</i>,
and another behind that which shews the <i>Heel</i>, it shews, that the
<i>Foot</i>
must be set down <i>flat.</i>
<p align=center><i>A flat Foot.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img2/p28flft.png" height=100 width=39>
<p>Marks for <i>Turning</i>, have no proper Places assign'd them, no more
than the <i>falling</i> or<i> sliding</i> Mark ; but you must then observe
to which side to turn, whether to the right or left.
<p>You must observe, that the beginning of the <i>turning</i> Mark, is
to be taken from that Part which is nearest to the black Spot.
<p>After having thus shewn the beginning of each <i>turning Mark</i>, you
must observe exactly which way to turn, whether to the <i>right </i>or
<i>left,</i>
as appears by the following Examples:
<table WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=CENTER>
<td ALIGN=CENTER><i>A quarter turn to the Right.</i>

</table>

<p>The beginning of a <i>whole Turn</i>, or<i> turn quite round</i>, is
more difficult to find out, because the Circle, which is the Mark of it,
has neither beginning nor End: But it is nevertheless to be known by a
<i>Point
</i>plac'd
on the side of the <i>Step</i>; from which Point the beginning being known,
you make Use of the same Rules as above.

When a <i>Turn</i> is to be made but half a quarter round, it must be mark'd

it to the Step.

I have already shewn, that all <i>Steps </i>and half <i>Positions</i>,
which have but one Point at either of their Extremities, signify either
the pointing of the <i>Toe</i>, or placing the <i>Heel</i>, without the
Body's bearing on it; but when there happens to be two Points, it then
shews, that the Body must bear upon it.

Having explain'd all the before-mention'd <i>Marks</i>, I hope it will
not be thought improper to shew when <i>Sinkings, Risings, Springings</i>,
and
<i>Slidings,</i> are to be made upon the <i>Toe, Heel</i>, or <i>flat

the <i>sliding</i> Marks only excepted.
<p>If there were, for Example, a <i>sinking</i> Mark upon a <i>half Position</i>,
it would shew, that the Knee of that Leg only was to be bent; but if <i>sinking

<i>How to hold the Book or Paper, to decipher written Dances</i></h2>
You must understand, the each page, on which the <i>Dance</i> is described,
represents the <i>Dancing-Room</i>; and the four Sides of the Page, the
four Sides of the <i>Room</i>, viz. the upper part of the Page, represents
the upper end of the <i>Room</i>; the lower part, the lower end; the right
side of the Page the right side of the <i>Room</i>; and the left side,
the left, as you may see by the following Figure, of which A B C D represent
the
<i>Room</i>, and E F G H, the Page. E F shew the upper part of the
Page, as C D do the lower end; F H the right side of the Page, as E F do
the upper end of the Room G H the lower part, as B D the right side of
the
<i>Room</i>; and E G the left side of the Page, as A C the left side
of the <i>Room</i>.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img4/p43 room.png" height=400 width=375>
<p>You
must observe always to hold the upper end of the Book against the upper
end of the <i>Room</i>; and whether the <i>Dance</i> have any <i>Turning</i>
in it or not, you must carefully avoid removing the Book from the Scituation
above demonstrated.
<p>When any Steps are made without <i>turning</i>, or in <i>turning</i>
quite round, then both sides of the Book must be held with both Hands;
but in <i>turning</i> a quarter round, half round, or three quarters round,
it will be necessary to take more Care, because it will be difficult to
<i>turn</i>,
unles the Book turns also; yet this must be absolutely avoided; for if
the Book moves out of its Scituation, it will be impossible to comprehend
the <i>Steps</i> therein describ'd; wherefore, for the better Observation
of this, I shall give you the following Rules.
<p>After having consider'd the <i>Turning</i>, and on what side to turn,
as for Example, in a quarter <i>Turn</i> to the Right, you must put your
left Hand to the farther part of the Book, and your Right to the nearest.
Your Hands being thus prepared, in turning your quarter <i>Turn</i>, bring
your left Hand in to you, whilst your right removes from you; so that both
Hands will by this means be equally advanc'd before you, holding the Book
by the same places before-mention'd, and you will find, that in turning
a quarter round, the Book will still remain in its former Scituation. You
must make use of the same Rule in a <i>half Turn</i>.
<p>I shall only add, that the Hand, which is plac'd on the most opposite
part of the Book, must come quite in to your Breast, while the other removes
quite from you.
<p>To turn <i>three quarters round</i> to the Right, you must cross your
Hands more than you did in the <i>half Turn</i>; so that your left Hand
must hold the upper part of that side which your right Hand would naturally
have held, had you not turn'd; and your right Hand must hold the lower
part of that side, which your left would otherwise have held. Your Hands
being thus prepar'd, you will turn <i>three quarters round</i> in the same
manner as you did <i>half round</i>.
<p>The same Rules may be made use of in <i>turning</i> to the left, only
you must observe, that instead of placing your left Hand, you must place
the right to that part of the Book the farthest from you; and it may serve
for a general Rule, that in turning to the Right, you first remove your
left Hand; and in turning to the Left, you remove your Right.

<h2 align=center>
<i>Rules to be observ'd in Dancing by written Characters.</i></h2>
You must first find out the beginning of the <i>Tract</i>, by which means
you will know towards what part of the <i>Dancing-Room</i> the Body is
to be plac'd, before the <i>Dance</i> begins, as has been shewn before,
in speaking of the <i>Posture</i>, and <i>Presence of the Body</i>. Then
observe whether there be any <i>Position</i>, as you will find in the following
Examples, and there you are to place your self. Then see what <i>Step</i>
is nearest to the said <i>Position</i>, and you will find it to be that
which is mark'd
<i>Number</i> 1. Which having perform'd, observe which
is nearest to that, and you will find it is that mark'd <i>Number</i> 2.
After this, you must move to <i>Number</i> 3, then to <i>Number</i> 4,
&amp;c. and so continue moving, observing exactly to perform that <i>Step</i>
which is nearest to the place where you are, and to follow always the same
<i>Rule</i>
as well in moving forwards, backwards, and sideways, as in moving round.

<i>How to know what </i>Steps<i> and </i>half Positions<i> are with the
right Foot, and what with the left.</i></h2>
The <i>Tract</i> or <i>Line</i>, on which <i>Dances</i> are describ'd,
whether forward or backward, must be consider'd in respect to its right
side mark'd R, and the left side mark'd L, as may be seen by the following
<i>Example.</i>
<p>The <i>Steps</i> and <i>half Positions</i>, which are on the right side,
are made with the right Foot; and those which are on the left side, with
the left Foot, as the following <i>Movements</i> will demonstrate, where
I shall give to each <i>Step</i> and <i>half Position</i>, the same Letters
r and l, the better to explain them.
<p>Besides the Letters, r and l, the <i>Step</i> and <i>half Position</i>
of the right or left Foot, will be easily known, by observing which way
the <i>Toes</i> are turn'd.
<p>The <i>Toe</i> turning outwards on the right side, is the right Foot,
and the <i>Toe</i> turning outwards on the left side, is the left.
<p>The different <i>Tracts</i> or <i>Figures</i> made in <i>Dancing</i>,
whether forwards, backwards, sideways, or round, will be explain'd by what
follows.
<p>The <i>Tract</i> mark'd A, is moving forwards, the Face towards the
upper end of the <i>Room</i>.
<p>The <i>Tract</i> B retires or goes back, the Face towards the lower
end of the <i>Room</i>.
<p>The <i>Tract</i> F is moving forwards, the Face towards the right side
of the <i>Room</i>.
<p>The <i>Tract</i> H retires, the Face towards the left side of the <i>Room</i>.
<p>The <i>Tract</i> I, moves forwards, the Face towards the left side of
the <i>Room</i>.
<p>The <i>Tract</i> K retires backwards, the Face towards the right side
of the <i>Room</i>.
<p>The <i>Tracts</i> G, move round, and the <i>Tracts</i> M, retire round.
<p align=center>><img alt=" "  SRC="img4/p47.png" height=844 width=600>
<p>In moving sideways, the <i>Tract</i> or <i>Line</i> must also be considered
as to its two sides, <i>viz</i>. the upper side mark'd X, and the under
side mark'd Y. <i>Steps</i> and <i>half Positions</i>, which are on the
upper side of the Line, are to be made with the foremost Foot, and those
which are on the under side, with the hinder Foot.
<p>The <i>Tracts</i> mark'd N, are moving sideways to the right, towards
the lower end of the <i>Room</i>.
<p>The <i>Tracts</i> R, move round sideways to the right.
<p>And the <i>Tracts</i> S, move round sideways to the left.

<h2 align=center>
<i>The manner of Steps crossing one another</i>.</h2>
A <i>Step</i> which begins with the hind Foot, in order to move sideways,
to end on a Line with the other Foot, ought to begin from the part under
the Line, and rise obliquely sideways towards that above, as you may see
by the following <i>Step</i>.

<p>A <i>Step</i>, which is to cross behind the foregoing <i>Step</i>, must
begin above the Line, and descend obliquely below it; and which you will
easily understand by the following Example: The first <i>Step</i> you may
know by <i>Number</i> 1, and the other, which crosses, by <i>Number</i>
2.

<p>A <i>Step</i>, which begins with the foremost Foot, in order to move

<i>To return upon a Tract you have just before mov'd on.</i></h2>
For <i>Example</i>, if you have mov'd from the lower end of the <i>Room</i>,
to the upper end, and have a mind to return upon the same <i>Tract</i>,
as the <i>Tract</i> mark'd A, you must remove, and place the <i>Line</i>
or <i>Tract</i>, on which you would return, on one side or the other, as
you shall find most convenient, as is mark'd by the Letter B, and which
in effect is the same with the foregoing; which two <i>Tracts</i> must
be join'd together by a pointed <i>Line</i> mark'd C, which only serves
to conduct the Sight from one <i>Line</i> to the other.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img4/p49 illustration.png" height=250 width=159>
<p>The same thing must be observ'd in moving several times round on the same
<i>Circle</i>,
as upon the <i>Circle</i> mark'd D; about which may be describ'd as many
<i>Circles</i>
as shall be necessary. As for <i>Example</i>, the
<i>Circles</i> E and
F, which must be supposed to be on the same <i>Circle</i> with the
<i>Circle</i>
D.

<i>To know to and from what Positions, Steps move</i>.</h2>
I might have mark'd the <i>Positions</i>, in which each <i>Step</i> ought
to terminate; but since this must have created a great deal of Trouble,
I shall only confine my self to mark them on join'd and inclos'd <i>Steps</i>,
and for the rest, whether forwards, backwards, sideways, or cross'd, the
<i>Positions</i>
may be easily known, without marking them, in observing that which follows.
<p><i>Steps</i> which move forwards or backwards, shall be taken to be
in the fourth <i>Position</i>.
<p><i>Steps</i> which move streight, opening sideways, shall be taken to
be in Second the <i>Position</i>, and <i>Steps</i> crossing, whether forwards

<p>If it should happen nevertheless, that any of the above-mention'd <i>Steps</i>
should terminate upon both Feet, as it often happens in <i>rising</i> and
<i>springing</i>,
it is then necessary to mark the <i>Position</i>; without which it would
be impossible to know, that the <i>rising</i> and <i>springing</i> should
be on both Feet; wherefore, in demonstrating the <i>Positions</i> of <i>join'd</i>
and <i>inclos'd Steps</i>, I will add to them those before-mention'd, on
which I will also mark the <i>Positions</i>, to make Use of on Occasion.

<h2 align=center>
<i>How Steps terminate in Positions</i>.</h2>
When a <i>Step</i> terminates in a <i>Position</i>, there ought to be no
Foot at the end of it, because the half <i>Position</i>, to which it is
join'd, serves for that.

<p>A <i>Position</i> at the end of a <i>Step</i>, may be also known by
adding to the <i>Step</i> a <i>half Position</i>, because the Representation
of the Foot, which is at the Extremity of the <i>Step</i>, is made Use
of, upon this Occasion, for a <i>half Position</i>; and a <i>half Position</i>
join'd to it, is the same as a <i>whole Position</i>.

<i>Of simple and compound Steps.</i></h2>
All <i>Steps</i> may be either <i>simple</i> or <i>compound</i>.
<p>A <i>simple Step</i>, is that which is alone, as all those which hitherto
demonstrated; and a <i>compound Step</i>, is, where two or more <i>Steps</i>
are join'd together by a <i>Line</i>, and which then are to be reputed
as one <i>Step</i> only, as will appear by the following <i>Steps</i>.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img4/p53 6 illustrations.png" height=151 width=600>
<p>To practise
more easily what has already been taught and demonstrated, you may make
Use of the following <i>Tables</i>; where you will find all or the greatest
Part of the <i>Steps</i> us'd in <i>Dancing</i>, whether with one Foot,
or the other, forwards, backwards, sideways, or turning, as well upon streight
Lines, as diametrical.

<i>Of Time, Measure, or Cadence.</i></h2>
There are three sorts of<i> Time</i> in <i>Dancing, viz. Common Time, Triple
Time, </i>and <i>Quadruple Time.</i>
<p><i>Common Time,</i> is used in<i> Gavots, Galliards, Bouree's, Rigandons,
Jiggs, </i>and <i>Canaries.</i>
<p><i>Triple Time, </i>is made use of in <i>Courants, Sarabands, Chaconnes,
Passacailes, Minuets,</i> and<i> Passe-Pieds.</i>
<p><i>And Quadruple Time,</i> is made use of in slow <i>Tunes, </i>as appears
by the second <i>Tune</i> in the following Plate, and the<i> Tunes </i>called
<i>Loures.</i>
<p><i>To Tunes </i>of <i>Common</i> or <i>Triple Time,</i> a <i>Step </i>is
put for each <i>Barr </i>or<i> Measure; </i>and to <i>Tunes </i>of<i> Quadruple
Time, y</i>ou must put two.
<p>It is to be observ'd nevertheless, that in <i>Courant Movements,</i>
two <i>Steps </i>are put to each<i> Barr </i>or <i>Measure; </i>the first
of which takes up two parts in three of the <i>Measure, </i>and the second
takes up the third part; and in the <i>Minuet, </i>one <i>Step </i>is put
to two<i> Barrs </i>or <i>Measures.</i>
<p>The <i>Barrs</i> or <i>Measures</i> in <i>Dances, </i>must be marked
in like manner with those in <i>Musick,</i> viz. with little <i>Barrs </i>crossing
the <i>Tract, </i>which are to agree with those of the <i>Tune.Example.</i>
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p97.png" height=160 width=51>
<p>You will understand by the following Examples, how each <i>Step </i>agrees
with the <i>Tune</i> to which they are composed.
<p align=center><i>Common time</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p98r1.png" height=75 width=600>
<p align=center><i>Triple time</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p98r2.png" height=79 width=600>
<p align=center><i>Example of Steps which doe agree with the Measure of Common or Triple
Time.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p98r3.png" height=440 width=600>
<p align=center><i>Quadruple Time.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p98r4.png" height=79 width=600>
<p align=center><i>Lovres</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p98r5.png" height=80 width=600>
<p align=center><i>Example of Steps agreeing with Quadruple Time or Louves.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p98r6.png" height=376 width=600>
<p>If it happens that you have occasion to put more <i>Steps</i> in a
<i>Measure,</i>
than are in the foregoing Examples, the following Rules must be observed.
<p>If, for Example, you would in a <i>Measure</i> of <i>Common Time</i>,
or half a<i> Measure</i> of <i>Quadruple Time</i>, which is the same thing,
put a <i>Fleuret</i> and a <i>Bound</i>; the three <i>Steps</i> composing
the <i>Fleuret</i>, must have a double Tie to join them, and which will
shew their Motion to be as swift again, as if there had been but one; the
<i>Bound
</i>also
must be joined to the <i>Fleuret</i> with a single Tie only; by which you
will know, that these two <i>Steps</i> are in Effect but one.
<p align=center><i>Examples.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p99r1c1.png" height=350 width=203><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p99r1c2.png" height=350 width=194>
<p>If you would put the same<i> Step</i> in a <i>Measure</i> of <i>Triple
Time</i>, the two first <i>Steps</i> of the <i>Fleuret </i>must only have
a double Tie.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p99r2.png" height=350 width=223>
<p>When in <i>Dancing</i> some<i> Measures</i> of the<i> Tune</i>, are
to be let slip, whether in the beginning or middle of the <i>Dance</i>,
it must be mark'd in the following manner, vis. by a little Stroke crossing
obliquely the Tract, and as many of them are to be mark'd, as there are
<i>Barrs</i>
to be let slip; and in describing a half Measure, half the Stroke only
must be mark'd.
<p align=center><i>Three Measures and a half.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p100r1.png" height=150 width=64>
<p>The same Stroke longways,
parallel with the <i>Tract</i>, is equivalent to four of the foregoing
Strokes, and takes up four Measures of the <i>Tune</i>.
<p align=center><i>Fourteen Measures.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p100r2.png" height=150 width=68>
<p>For a <i>Time, half
Time</i>, or <i>quarter Time</i>, &amp;c. they may be mark'd in the same
manner as they are in Musick.
<p align=center><i>A quarter Time. A half Time. A Time</i>.
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p100r3t.png" height=150 width=232>
<p>In <i>Tunes</i>, which begin with odd Notes, as <i>Gavots, Chaconnes,
Jiggs, loures, Bouree's</i>, &amp;c. the foregoing Marks must be made Use
of in the beginning of the <i>Tract</i>.
<p>The Letters of the Alphabet, which are plac'd upon the <i>Steps</i>
in the following Example, and which are also plac'd over the Notes of the
Tune, demonstrate the
<i>Time</i> or <i>Cadence</i> of a Dance.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p101r1.png" height=391 width=600>

<h2 align=center>
<i>Of the Figure.</i></h2>
There are two Sorts of <i>Figures</i> in <i>Dancing</i>, viz. a <i>Regular</i>,
and an <i>Irregular</i>.
<p>A <i>regular Figure</i>, is when two or more <i>Dancers</i> move contrarily,
the one to the Right, and the other to the Left.
<p align=center><i>A regular Figure.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p101r2.png" height=289 width=300>
<p>An
<i>irregular Figure</i>, is when two <i>Dancers</i> move together,
both in the same
<i>Figure</i>, on the same side.
<p align=center><i>An irregular Figure.</i>
<br><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p102r1.png" height=183 width=350>
<p>By the Mark representing the Presence of the Body, you will distinguish
the <i>Tract</i> for the Man, from that of the Woman; in that for the Man,
the <i>half Circle</i> is single, and that for the Woman, is double. The
Distinction for two Men, or two Women Dancing together, is known by a <i>Point</i>
plac'd in the middle of the <i>half Circle</i> of one of them, that wherein
the Point is, representing the <i>Tract</i> for the Woman Side.
<table WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=CENTER>

</tr>
</table>

<p>If a Number of <i>Dancers</i> figure together, the Mark for the placing
the Body will not be sufficient to distinguish them, (as in a Dance for
eight:) On this Occasion therefore, you may make Use of Letters, of which
AA may represent two which figure together. BB two others. CC two more,
and DD the other two; each of which, will also be distinguish'd by there
<i>figuring</i>,
and which the following Example will demonstrate.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p103.png" height=337 width=500>


<h2 align=center>
<i>Some Rules to be observed in the Figures of Dances.</i></h2>
I Have already shewn, that the <i>Tract</i> serves for two Ends,
<i>viz</i>.
first, on which to describe the <i>Steps</i> and <i>Positions</i>; and
secondly, for the Direction of the <i>Figure</i> of the Dance.
<p>I shall now add, that when in <i>Dancing</i>, several <i>Steps</i> are
to be perform'd in the same place, the <i>Tract</i> is then to be respected
only as the Conductor of the <i>Step</i>, and not in Relation to the <i>Figure</i>;
but where the <i>Steps</i> move continually from one place to another,
then the <i>Tract</i> is to be observ'd, not only for the Description of
the <i>Steps</i>, but also for the <i>Figure</i> of the <i>Dance</i>. Place
your self then where the beginning of the <i>Tract</i> directs, and observe
whether the <i>Figure</i> be <i>streight, diametrical, circular</i>, or
<i>oblique</i>,
whether it be <i>forwards, backwarks</i>, or <i>sideways</i>, if to the
right, or to the left; all which I have already demonstrated in the foregoing
Pages; then having learnt the Tune, which must be prick'd down on the Top
of each Page, add the Steps to the Tune, as has been already shewn, moving
in the <i>Figure</i> as is described on the Paper. When it happens that
the <i>Tract</i> or <i>Tracts</i> cross one another, the <i>Steps</i> on
the one, must leave a sufficient Breach, for the describing the <i>Steps</i>;
on the other, to avoid Confusion.

<h2 align=center>
<i>For giving the Hands in Dancing</i>.</h2>
You will know when to give the Hand, by a small <i>Crescent</i> or
<i>half
Circle</i> at the end of a little Barr or Stroke, which is to be plac'd
on the side of the <i>Tract</i>, viz. when it is on the right side of the
<i>Tract</i>,
it shews, that you must give the right Hand; and when on the left, it shews
the
left Hand is to be given; and when there is one on each side, both Hands
must then be given.
<table WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=CENTER>
<td ALIGN=CENTER><i>To give the right Hand.</i>

</tr>
</table>

<p>When you have thus given one Hand or both, you are not to quit Hands,
'till you find the same Marks cut through with another little Stroke, which
shews, that in that place the Hands are to let go.
<table WIDTH="100%" >

<h2 align=center>
<i>Of the Movement of the Arms.</i></h2>
Although the Carriage and <i>Movement</i> of the <i>Arms</i> depend more
on the Fancy of the Performer, than on any certain Rules, I shall nevertheless
lay down some Examples, which will explain, by demonstrative Characters,
the different <i>Motion</i> of the <i>Arms</i> in <i>Dancing</i>; or at
least, will inform you what Characters to make Use of in describing the
<i>Motion</i>
of the <i>Arms</i>, to the Movement of each <i>Step</i>.
<p>The Arm is represented by the Letters ABC, of which A represents the
Shoulder, B the Elbow, and C the Wrist.
<table WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=CENTER>

</tr>
</table>


<h2 align=center>
<i>Where to place the Motion of the Arms on the Tract.</i></h2>
In moving forwards or backwards in the <i>Dance</i>, the <i>Arms</i> must
be mark'd on each side the <i>Tract</i>, the right <i>Arm</i> on the right
side the <i>Tract</i>, and the left <i>Arm</i> on the left side; but when
in the <i>Figure</i> of the <i>Dance</i>, the Movement is sideways, they
are to be mark'd both on one side, always observing, that the right
<i>Arm</i>
must be to the right, and the left <i>Arm</i> to the left.
<table WIDTH="100%" >
<tr ALIGN=CENTER>
<td ALIGN=CENTER><i>Both Arms open.</i>

</table>

<p>I shall not pretend to make a long Disquisition on the <i>Motion</i>
of the <i>Arms</i>, but shall only add, that as there are three Movements
from the Waste downwards, fo there are also three Movements in the <i>Arms</i>,
which have a Correspondence, and are agreeing with them below, <i>viz</i>.
that of the Wrist, has Relation to the Heel; that of the Elbow, to the
Knee, and that of the Shoulder, or the whole Arm, to the Thigh.
<p>You will know when the Arm moves by an arch'd Line, mark'd C D, drawn
from that which represents the end of the Arm, which shews the Figure the
Wrist makes in moving, as from C to D.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p106r1c1.png" height=66 width=120><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p106r1c2.png" height=78 width=120><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p106r1c3.png" height=82 width=120><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p106r1c4.png" height=48 width=120>
<p>The <i>Movements</i> of the <i>Arms</i> are to be perform'd two ways,
upwards or downwards; upwards from the <i>Position</i> of the <i>Arm</i>
below, or downwards from the <i>Position</i> above.
<p>The <i>Motion</i> of the <i>Arm</i> upwards, is when the <i>Arm</i>,
which is open or extended, closes (in approaching) to the Body ascending,
and the Motion of the <i>Arm</i> downwards, is when the <i>Arm</i>, which
is clos'd, opens or extends it self descending.

<i>Some Rules to be observed in writing of Dances.</i></h2>
You must resolve in what part of the <i>Room</i> the <i>Dance</i> is to
begin, and there place the beginning of the<i> Tract</i>; then trace out
the <i>Figure</i>, and mark thereon the <i>Position</i>; then describe
the <i>Steps</i>, as I have shewn in the foregoing Examples; and if you
find any Difficulty in writing any of the <i>Steps</i>, you must make Use
of your <i>Table</i> of <i>Steps</i>; and in finding the <i>Step</i> you
have Occasion for, you ought first to consider what <i>Step</i> it is,
whether <i>Courant, Coupee, Bouree, Bound, Contretemps</i>, &amp;c. Suppose,
for Example, the Step to be a <i>Bouree</i>, turn then to the Table of
<i>Bouree's</i>
or <i>Fleurets</i>, and having found the <i>Step</i> you want, observe
after what manner it is describ'd, and then write it down in your Dance.
<p>On the Top of each Page, on which your Dance is describ'd, you must
prick down as many Barrs of the Tune, as there are Barns or Measures in
the Dance.
<p>Altho' the <i>Tract</i> serves generally for the explaining the <i>Figure</i>
of the Dance, yet it often happens that many Steps are to be perform'd
in the same Place, and then (as I have shewn before) the <i>Tract</i> is
to have regard only to the <i>Steps</i>. This <i>Tract</i> is only a borrow'd
<i>Tract</i>,
and which may be drawn any way, as shall be most convenient. As for Example,
from A to B, altho' the <i>Tract</i> is drawn out in length from A to B,
the <i>Dancer</i> nevertheless removes not from A, which may also be well
understood by the <i>Steps</i>, which are from A to B, which can only be
perform'd in the same place.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p108.png" height=235 width=600>
<p>You must observe at the end of each Page, the place where the <i>Dancer</i>
finishes, and to what part of the <i>Room</i> the Face directs, by which
means you will readily know where to place the beginning of the <i>Tract</i>
in the following Page ; and so continue from Page to Page, to the end of
the <i>Dance</i>.
<p>But if in the beginning of a Page, two Dancers should happen to be close
together, and some <i>Steps</i> to be perform'd in the same place; which
<i>Steps</i>
cannot be conveniently described, neither on one side, or the other, and
that the Closeness of the <i>Dancers</i>, will not admit of advancing of
the
<i>Tracts,</i> one towards the other; you must then be oblig'd, instead
of placing the
<i>Tracts</i> at C D, to retire as far back as will be necessary
to describe the <i>Steps,</i> so that the <i>Steps </i>may end at C D.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p109r1.png" height=143 width=600>
<p>Or else the contrary may be done, by placing the beginning of the <i>Steps</i>
at C D; and instead of describing the <i>Steps</i> one towards the other,
they must Separate, as from C to E, and D to F.
<p>You will find these are perform'd without the <i>Dancers</i> moving
out of their Places; and both these Examples are equally good, in considering
only which agrees best with the <i>Figure</i> of the<i> Dance</i> that
follows.
<p align=center><img alt=" "  SRC="img8/p109r2.png" height=112 width=600>
<p>If in the <i>Dances</i> in the second Volume, you find some of the <i>Steps</i>
longer than others, you must have no Regard to them, as to their Length
in the Description of them, but judge of their Extension by the Distance
of <i>Positions</i>, (as I have already shewn in the Termination of the
<i>Steps</i>,
in their <i>Positions</i>;) so that you are not to conclude any thing from
the Length or Shortness of Steps.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
