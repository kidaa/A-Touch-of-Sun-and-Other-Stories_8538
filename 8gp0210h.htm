<h2><a name="introduction">Prefatory Note</a></h2>
<br>
The object of <i>Georgian Poetry</i> 1911-1912 was to give a convenient
survey of the work published within two years by some poets of the newer
generation. The book was welcomed; and perhaps, even in a time like
this, those whom it interested may care to have a corresponding volume
for the three years which have since passed.<br>
<br>
Two of the poets &mdash; I think the youngest, and certainly not the least
gifted &mdash; are dead. Rupert Brooke, who seemed to have everything that is
worth having, died last April in the service of his country. James Elroy
Flecker, to whom life and death were less generous, died in January
after a long and disabling illness.<br>
<br>
A few of the contributors to the former volume are not represented in
this one, either because they have published nothing which comes within
its scope, or because they belong in fact to an earlier poetic
generation, and their inclusion must be allowed to have been an
anachronism. Two names are added.<br>
<br>
The alphabetical arrangement of the writers has been modified in order
to recognize the honour which Mr Gordon Bottomley has done to the book
by allowing his play to be first published here.<br>
<br>
My thanks for permission to print the poems are due to Messrs Constable,
Duckworth, Heinemann, Herbert Jenkins, Macmillan, Elkin Mathews,
Methuen, Martin Seeker, and Sidgwick and Jackson; and to the Editors of
<i>Country Life</i>, the <i>English Review, Flying Fame, New
Numbers</i>, the <i>New Statesman</i>, and the <i>Westminster
Gazette</i>.<br>

<i>The scene is a bedchamber in a one-storied house. The walls consist
of a few courses of huge irregular boulders roughly squared and fitted
together; a thatched roof rises steeply from the back wall. In the
centre of the back wall is a doorway opening on a garden and covered by
two leather curtains; the chamber is partially hung with similar
hangings stitched with bright wools. There is a small window on each
side of this door.<br>
<br>
Toward the front a bed stands with its head against the right wall; it
has thin leather curtains hung by thongs and drawn back. Farther forward
a rich robe and a crown hang on a peg in the same wall. There is a
second door beyond the bed, and between this and the bed's head stands a
small table with a bronze lamp and a bronze cup on it. Queen HYGD, an
emaciated woman, is asleep in the bed; her plenteous black hair, veined
with silver, spreads over the pillow. Her waiting-woman, MERRYN,
middle-aged and hard-featured, sits watching her in a chair on the
farther side of the bed. The light of early morning fills the room.</i><br>
<br>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
<br>
<br>

<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>Many, many must die who long to live,<br>
Yet this one cannot die who longs to die:<br>
Even her sleep, come now at last, thwarts death,<br>
Although sleep lures us all half way to death....<br>
I could not sit beside her every night<br>
If I believed that I might suffer so:<br>
I am sure I am not made to be diseased,<br>
I feel there is no malady can touch me &mdash; <br>
Save the red cancer, growing where it will.</blockquote><br>

<i>Taking her beads from her girdle, she kneels at the foot of the bed.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>O sweet Saint Cleer, and sweet Saint Elid too,<br>
Shield me from rooting cancers and from madness:<br>
Shield me from sudden death, worse than two death-beds;<br>
Let me not lie like this unwanted queen,<br>
Yet let my time come not ere I am ready &mdash; <br>
Grant space enow to relish the watchers' tears<br>
And give my clothes away and calm my features<br>
And streek my limbs according to my will,<br>
Not the hard will of fumbling corpse-washers.</blockquote><br>

<i>She prays silently</i><br>
<br>
<i>KING LEAR, a great, golden-bearded man in the full maturity of life,
enters abruptly by the door beyond the bed, followed by the PHYSICIAN.</i><br>
<br>
<br>


<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Why are you here? Are you here for ever?<br>
Where is the young Scotswoman? Where is she?</blockquote><br>

<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>O, Sire, move softly; the Queen sleeps at last.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear (continuing in an undertone):</i>

<blockquote>Where is the young Scotswoman? Where is Gormflaith?<br>
It is her watch ... I know; I have marked your hours.<br>
Did the Queen send her away? Did the Queen<br>
Bid you stay near her in her hate of Gormflaith?<br>
You work upon her yeasting brain to think<br>
That she's not safe except when you crouch near her<br>
To spy with your dropt eyes and soundless presence.</blockquote><br>


<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>Sire, midnight should have ended Gormflaith's watch,<br>
But Gormflaith had another kind of will<br>
And ended at a godlier hour by slumber,<br>
A letter in her hand, the night-lamp out.<br>
She loitered in the hall when she should sleep.<br>
My duty has two hours ere she returns.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>The Queen should have young women about her bed,<br>
Fresh cool-breathed women to lie down at her side<br>
And plenish her with vigour; for sick or wasted women<br>
Can draw a virtue from such abounding presence,<br>
When night makes life unwary and looses the strings of being,<br>
Even by the breath, and most of all by sleep.<br>
Her slumber was then no fault: go you and find her.</blockquote><br>

<i>Physician:</i>

<blockquote>It is not strange that a bought watcher drowses;<br>
  What is most strange is that the Queen sleeps<br>
  Who would not sleep for all my draughts of sleep<br>
  In the last days. When did this change appear?
</blockquote><br>

<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>We shall not know &mdash; it came while Gormflaith nodded.<br>
  When I awoke her and she saw the Queen<br>
  She could not speak for fear:<br>
  When the rekindling lamp showed certainly<br>
  The bed-clothes stirring about our lady's neck,<br>
  She knew there was no death, she breathed, she said<br>
  She had not slept until her mistress slept<br>
  And lulled her; but I asked her how her mistress<br>
  Slept, and her utterance faded.<br>
  She should be blamed with rods, as I was blamed<br>
  For slumber, after a day and a night of watching,<br>
  By the Queen's child-bed, twenty years ago.
</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>She does what she must do: let her alone.<br>
  I know her watch is now: get gone and send her.
</blockquote><br>

<i>MERRYN goes out by the door beyond the bed.</i><br><br>

<blockquote>Is it a portent now to sleep at night?<br>
  What change is here? What see you in the Queen?<br>
  Can you discern how this disease will end?</blockquote><br>



<i>Physician:</i>

<blockquote>Surmise might spring and healing follow yet,<br>
  If I could find a trouble that could heal;<br>
  But these strong inward pains that keep her ebbing <br>
  Have not their source in perishing flesh.<br>
  I have seen women creep into their beds<br>
  And sink with this blind pain because they nursed<br>
  Some bitterness or burden in the mind<br>
  That drew the life, sucklings too long at breast.<br>
  Do you know such a cause in this poor lady?
</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>There is no cause. How should there be a cause?</blockquote><br>

<i>Physician:</i>

<blockquote>We cannot die wholly against our wills;<br>
  And in the texture of women I have found<br>
  Harder determination than in men:<br>
  The body grows impatient of enduring,<br>
  The harried mind is from the body estranged,<br>
  And we consent to go: by the Queen's touch,<br>
  The way she moves &mdash; or does not move &mdash; in bed,<br>
  The eyes so cold and keen in her white mask,<br>
  I know she has consented.<br>
  The snarling look of a mute wounded hawk,<br>
  That would be let alone, is always hers &mdash; <br>
  Yet she was sorely tender: it may be<br>
  Some wound in her affection will not heal.<br>
  We should be careful &mdash; the mind can so be hurt<br>
  That nought can make it be unhurt again.<br>
  Where, then, did her affection most persist?</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Old bone-patcher, old digger in men's flesh,<br>
  Doctors are ever itching to be priests,<br>
  Meddling in conduct, natures, life's privacies.<br>
  We have been coupled now for twenty years,<br>
  And she has never turned from me an hour &mdash; <br>
  She knows a woman's duty and a queen's:<br>
  Whose, then, can her affection be but mine?<br>
  How can I hurt her &mdash; she is still my queen?<br>
  If her strong inward pain is a real pain<br>
  Find me some certain drug to medicine it:<br>
  When common beings have decayed past help,<br>
  There must be still some drug for a king to use;<br>
  For nothing ought to be denied to kings.</blockquote><br>

<i>Physician:</i>

 <blockquote>For the mere anguish there is such a potion.<br>
  The gum of warpy juniper shoots is seethed<br>
  With the torn marrow of an adder's spine;<br>
  An unflawed emerald is pashed to dust<br>
  And mingled there; that broth must cool in moonlight.<br>
  I have indeed attempted this already,<br>
  But the poor emeralds I could extort<br>
  From wry-mouthed earls' women had no force.<br>
  In two more dawns it will be late for potions....<br>
  There are not many emeralds in Britain,<br>
  And there is none for vividness and strength<br>
  Like the great stone that hangs upon your breast:<br>
  If you will waste it for her she shall be holpen.
</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear (with rising voice):</i>

<blockquote>Shatter my emerald? My emerald? My emerald?<br>
  A High King of Eire gave it to his daughter<br>
  Who mothered generations of us, the kings of Britain;<br>
  It has a spiritual influence; its heart<br>
  Burns when it sees the sun ... Shatter my emerald!<br>
  Only the fungused brain and carious mouth   <br>
  Of senile things could shape such thought ...<br>
      My emerald!</blockquote><br>

<i>HYGD stirs uneasily in her sleep.</i><br>
<br>
<br>


<i>Physician:</i>

<blockquote>Speak lower, low; for your good fame, speak low &mdash; <br>
  If she should waken thus ...
</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>                   There is no wise man<br>
  Believes that medicine is in a jewel.<br>
  It is enough that you have failed with one.<br>
  Seek you a common stone. I'll not do it.<br>
  Let her eat heartily: she is spent with fasting.<br>
  Let her stand up and walk: she is so still<br>
  Her blood can never nourish her. Come away.</blockquote><br>

<i>Physician:</i>

<blockquote>I must not leave her ere the woman comes &mdash; <br>
  Or will some other woman ...</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>                 No, no, no, no;<br>
  The Queen is not herself; she speaks without sense;<br>
  Only Merryn and Gormflaith understand.<br>
  She is better quiet. Come ...</blockquote><br>


<i>He urges the PHYSICIAN roughly away by the shoulder.</i><br><br><blockquote>My emerald!</blockquote><br>

<i>He follows the PHTSICIAN out by the door at the back.
 Queen HYGD awakes at his last noisy words as he disappears.</i><br>
<br>
<br>



<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>I have not slept; I did but close mine eyes<br>
  A little while &mdash; a little while forgetting ...<br>
  Where are you, Merryn? ... Ah, it is not Merryn ...<br>
  Bring me the cup of whey, woman; I thirst ...<br>
  Will you speak to me if I say your name?<br>
  Will you not listen, Gormflaith? ... Can you hear?<br>
  I am very thirsty &mdash; let me drink ...<br>
  Ah, wicked woman, why did I speak to you?<br>
  I will not be your suppliant again ...<br>
  Where are you? O, where are you? ... Where are you?</blockquote><br>

<i>She tries to raise herself to look about the room, but sinks back
helplessly. The curtains of the door at the back are parted, and GONERIL
appears in hunting dress, &mdash; her kirtle caught up in her girdle, a light
spear over her shoulder &mdash; stands there a moment, then enters noiselessly
and, approaches the bed. She is a girl just turning to woman-hood, proud
in her poise, swift and cold, an almost gleaming presence, a virgin
huntress.</i><br>
<br>
<br>


<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Mother, were you calling?<br>
  Have I awakened you?<br>
  They said that you were sleeping.<br>
  Why are you left alone, mother, my dear one?</blockquote><br>


<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>Who are you? No, no, no! Stand farther off!<br>
  You pulse and glow; you are too vital; your presence hurts ...<br>
  Freshness of hill-swards, wind and trodden ling,<br>
  I should have known that Goneril stands here.<br>
  It is yet dawn, but you have been afoot<br>
  Afar and long: where could you climb so soon?</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Dearest, I am an evil daughter to you:<br>
I never thought of you &mdash; O, never once &mdash; <br>
Until I heard a moor-bird cry like you.<br>
I am wicked, rapt in joys of breath and life,<br>
And I must force myself to think of you.<br>
I leave you to caretakers' cold gentleness;<br>
But O, I did not think that they dare leave you.<br>
What woman should be here?</blockquote><br>

<i>Hygd:</i>

 <blockquote>            I have forgot ...<br>
I know not ... She will be about some duty.<br>
I do not matter: my time is done ... nigh done ...<br>
Bought hands can well prepare me for a grave,<br>
And all the generations must serve youth.<br>
My girls shall live untroubled while they may,<br>
And learn happiness once while yet blind men<br>
Have injured not their freedom;<br>
For women are not meant for happiness.<br>
Where have you been, my falcon?</blockquote><br>


<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>I dreamt that I was swimming, shoulder up,<br>
And drave the bed-clothes spreading to the floor:<br>
Coldness awoke me; through the waning darkness<br>
I heard far hounds give shivering aery tongue,<br>
Remote, withdrawing, suddenly faint and near;<br>
I leapt and saw a pack of stretching weasels<br>
Hunt a pale coney in a soundless rush,<br>
Their elfin and thin yelping pierced my heart<br>
As with an unseen beauty long awaited;<br>
Wolf-skin and cloak I buckled over this night-gear,<br>
And took my honoured spear from my bed-side<br>
Where none but I may touch its purity,<br>
And sped as lightly down the dewy bank<br>
As any mothy owl that hunts quick mice.<br>
They went crying, crying, but I lost them<br>
Before I stept, with the first tips of light,<br>
On Raven Crag near by the Druid Stones;<br>
So I paused there and, stooping, pressed my hand<br>
Against the stony bed of the clear stream;<br>
Then entered I the circle and raised up<br>
My shining hand in cold stern adoration<br>
Even as the first great gleam went up the sky.</blockquote><br>


<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>Ay, you do well to worship on that height:<br>
Life is free to the quick up in the wind,<br>
And the wind bares you for a god's descent &mdash; <br>
For wind is a spirit immediate and aged.<br>
And you do well to worship harsh men-gods,<br>
God Wind and Those who built his Stones with him:<br>
All gods are cruel, bitter, and to be bribed,<br>
But women-gods are mean and cunning as well.<br>
That fierce old virgin, Cornish Merryn, prays<br>
To a young woman, yes and even a virgin &mdash; <br>
The poorest kind of woman &mdash; and she says<br>
That is to be a Christian: avoid then<br>
Her worship most, for men hate such denials,<br>
And any woman scorns her unwed daughter.<br>
Where sped you from that height? Did Regan join you there?
</blockquote><br>


<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote> Does Regan worship anywhere at dawn?<br>
The sweaty half-clad cook-maids render lard<br>
Out in the scullery, after pig-killing,<br>
And Regan sidles among their greasy skirts,<br>
Smeary and hot as they, for craps to suck.<br>
I lost my thoughts before the giant Stones ...<br>
And when anew the earth assembled round me<br>
I swung out on the heath and woke a hare<br>
And speared it at a cast and shouldered it,<br>
Startled another drinking at a tarn<br>
And speared it ere it leapt; so steady and clear<br>
Had the god in his fastness made my mind.<br>
Then, as I took those dead things in my hands,<br>
I felt shame light my face from deep within,<br>
And loathing and contempt shake in my bowels,<br>
That such unclean coarse blows from me had issued<br>
To crush delicate things to bloody mash<br>
And blemish their fur when I would only kill.<br>
My gladness left me; I careered no more<br>
Upon the morning; I went down from there<br>
With empty hands:<br>
But under the first trees and without thought<br>
I stole on conies at play and stooped at one;<br>
I hunted it, I caught it up to me<br>
As I outsprang it, and with this thin knife<br>
Pierced it from eye to eye; and it was dead,<br>
Untorn, unsullied, and with flawless fur.<br>
Then my untroubled mind came back to me.</blockquote><br>


<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote> Leap down the glades with a fawn's ignorance;<br>
Live you your fill of a harsh purity;<br>
Be wild and calm and lonely while you may.<br>
These are your nature's joys, and it is human<br>
Only to recognise our natures' joys<br>
When we are losing them for ever.</blockquote><br>



<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>          But why<br>
Do you say this to me with a sore heart?<br>
You are a queen, and speak from the top of life,<br>
And when you choose to wish for others' joys<br>
Those others must have woe.</blockquote><br>


<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>The hour comes for you to turn to a man<br>
And give yourself with the high heart of youth<br>
More lavishly than a queen gives anything.<br>
But when a woman gives herself<br>
She must give herself for ever and have faith;<br>
For woman is a thing of a season of years,<br>
She is an early fruit that will not keep,<br>
She can be drained and as a husk survive<br>
To hope for reverence for what has been;<br>
While man renews himself into old age,<br>
And gives himself according to his need,<br>
And women more unborn than his next child<br>
May take him yet with youth<br>
And lose him with their potence.<br>
</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>But women need not wed these men.</blockquote><br>


<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>We are good human currency, like gold,<br>
For men to pass among them when they choose.</blockquote><br>

<i>A child's hands beat on the outside of the door beyond the bed.</i><br>
<br>
<br>



<i>Cordeil's Voice (a child's voice, outside):</i>

<blockquote>Father ... Father ... Father ... Are you here?<br>
Merryn, ugly Merryn, let me in ...<br>
I know my father is here ... I want him ... Now ... <br>
Mother, chide Merryn, she is old and slow ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Hygd (softly):</i>

<blockquote>My little curse. Send her away &mdash; away....</blockquote><br>


<i>Cordeil's Voice:</i>

<blockquote>Father... O, father, father... I want my father.</blockquote><br>


<i>Goneril (opening the door a little way):</i>

<blockquote>Hush; hush &mdash; you hurt your mother with your voice.<br>
You cannot come in, Cordeil; you must go away:<br>
Your father is not here ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Cordeil's Voice:</i>

<blockquote>          He must be here:<br>
He is not in his chamber or the hall,<br>
He is not in the stable or with Gormflaith:<br>
He promised I should ride with him at dawn<br>
And sit before his saddle and hold his hawk,<br>
And ride with him and ride to the heron-marsh;<br>
He said that he would give me the first heron,<br>
And hang the longest feathers in my hair.</blockquote><br>


<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Then you must haste to find him;<br>
He may be riding now ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Cordeil's Voice:</i>

<blockquote>But Gerda said she saw him enter here.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Indeed, he is not here ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Cordeil's Voice::</i>

<blockquote>Let me look ...</blockquote><br>



<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>You are too noisy. Must I make you go?</blockquote><br>

<i>Cordeil's Voice:</i>

<blockquote>Mother, Goneril is unkind to me.</blockquote><br>


<i>Hygd (raising herself in bed excitedly, and speaking so vehemently that
her utterance strangles itself):</i>

<blockquote>Go, go, thou evil child, thou ill-comer.</blockquote><br>

<i>GONERIL, with a sudden strong movement, shuts the resisting door and
holds it rigidly. The little hands beat on it madly for a moment, then
the child's voice is heard in a retreating wail.</i><br>
<br>
<br>


<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Though she is wilful, obeying only the King,<br>
She is a very little child, mother,<br>
To be so bitterly thought of.</blockquote><br>


<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>Because a woman gives herself for ever<br>
Cordeil the useless had to be conceived<br>
(Like an after-thought that deceives nobody)<br>
To keep her father from another woman.<br>
And I lie here.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril (after a silence):</i>

<blockquote> Hard and unjust my father has been to me;<br>
Yet that has knitted up within my mind<br>
A love of coldness and a love of him<br>
Who makes me firm, wary, swift and secret,<br>
Until I feel if I become a mother<br>
I shall at need be cruel to my children,    <br>
And ever cold, to string their natures harder   <br>
And make them able to endure men's deeds;<br>
But now I wonder if injustice<br>
Keeps house with baseness, taught by kinship &mdash; <br>
I never thought a king could be untrue,<br>
I never thought my father was unclean....<br>
O mother, mother, what is it? Is this dying?</blockquote><br>

<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>I think I am only faint ...<br>
Give me the cup of whey ...</blockquote><br>

<i>GONERIL takes the cup and, supporting HYGD lets her drink.</i><br>
<br>
<br>


<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>There is too little here. When was it made?</blockquote><br>

<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>Yester-eve ... Yester-morn ...</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>              Unhappy mother,<br>
You have no daughter to take thought for you &mdash; <br>
No servant's love to shame a daughter with,<br>
Though I am shamed &mdash; you must have other food,<br>
Straightway I bring you meat ...</blockquote><br>

<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>                   It is no use ...<br>
Plenish the cup for me ... Not now, not now,<br>
But in a while; for I am heavy now ...<br>
Old Wynoc's potions loiter in my veins,<br>
And tides of heaviness pour over me<br>
Each time I wake and think. I could sleep now.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Then I shall lull you, as you once lulled me.</blockquote><br>

<i>Seating herself on the bed, she sings.</i><br><br><blockquote>The owlets in roof-holes<br>
    Can sing for themselves;<br>
    The smallest brown squirrel<br>
    Both scampers and delves;<br>
    But a baby does nothing &mdash; <br>
    She never knows how &mdash; <br>
    She must hark to her mother<br>
    Who sings to her now.<br>
    Sleep then, ladykin, peeping so;<br>
    Hide your handies and ley lei lo.</blockquote><br>

<i>She bends over HYGD and kisses her; they laugh softly together. LEAR
parts the curtains of the door at the back, stands there a moment, then
goes away noiselessly.</i><br><br><blockquote>The lish baby otter<br>
    Is sleeky and streaming,<br>
    With catching bright fishes<br>
    Ere babies learn dreaming;<br>
    But no wet little otter<br>
    Is ever so warm<br>
    As the fleecy-wrapt baby<br>
    'Twixt me and my arm.<br>
    Sleep big mousie...</blockquote><br>




<i>Hygd (suddenly irritable):</i>

<blockquote>Be quiet ... I cannot bear it.</blockquote><br>

<i>She turns her head away from GONERIL and closes her eyes.</i><br>
<br>
<i>As GONERIL watches her in silence GORMFLAITH enters by the door beyond
the bed. She is young and tall and fresh-coloured; her red hair coils
and crisps close to her little head, showing its shape. Her movements
are soft and unhurried; her manner is quiet and ingratiating and a
little too agreeable; she speaks a little too gently.</i><br>
<br>
<br>



<i>Goneril (meeting her near the door and speaking in a low voice):</i>

<blockquote>Why did you leave the Queen? Where have you been?<br>
Why have you so neglected this grave duty?</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>This is the instant of my duty, Princess:<br>
From midnight until now was Merryn's watch.<br>
I thought to find her here: is she not here?</blockquote><br>

<i>HYGD turns to look at the speakers; then, turning back, closes her eyes
again and lies as if asleep.</i><br>
<br>
<br>


<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>I found the Queen alone. I heard her cry your name.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Your anger is not too great, Madam; I grieve<br>
That one so old as Merryn should act thus &mdash; <br>
So old and trusted and favoured, and so callous.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>The Queen has had no food since yester-night..</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Madam, that is too monstrous to conceive:<br>
I will seek food. I will prepare it now.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Stay here: and know, if the Queen is left again,<br>
You shall be beaten with two rods at once.
</blockquote><br>

<i>She picks up the cup and goes out by the door beyond the bed.</i><br>
<br>
<i>GORMFLAITH turns the chair a little away from the bed so that she can
watch the jar door, and, seating herself, draws a letter from her bosom.</i>
<br><br>
<br>
<i>Gormflaith (to herself, reading):</i>

<blockquote>"Open your window when the moon is dead,<br>
And I will come again.<br>
The men say everywhere that you are faithless,<br>
The women say your face is a false face<br>
And your eyes shifty eyes. Ah, but I love you, Gormflaith.<br>
Do not forget your window-latch to-night,<br>
For when the moon is dead the house is still."</blockquote><br>

<i>LEAR again parts the door-curtains at the back, and, seeing GORMFLAITH,
enters. At the first slight rustle of the curtains GORMFLAITH stealthily
slips the letter back into her bosom before turning gradually, a finger
to her lips, to see who approaches her.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear (leaning over the side of her chair):</i>

<blockquote> Lady, what do you read?</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith</i>

<blockquote>I read a letter, Sire.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>A letter &mdash; a letter &mdash; what read you in a letter?</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith (taking another letter from her girdle):</i>

<blockquote>Your words to me &mdash; my lonely joy your words ... <br>
"If you are steady and true as your gaze " &mdash; </blockquote><br>

<i>Lear (tearing the letter from her, crumpling it, and flinging it to the
back of the room):</i>

<blockquote>                                          Pest!<br>
You should not carry a king's letters about,<br>
Nor hoard a king's letters.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith: </i>

<blockquote>No, Sire.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Must the King also stand in the presence now?</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith (rising):</i>

<blockquote>Pardon my troubled mind; you have taken my letter from me.</blockquote><br>

<i>LEAR seats himself and takes GORMFLAITH'S hand.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Wait, wait &mdash; I might be seen. The Queen may waken yet.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stepping lightly to the led, she noiselessly slips the curtain on that
side as far forward as it will come. Then she returns to LEAR, who draws
her to him and seats her on his knee.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>You have been long in coming:<br>
Was Merryn long in finding you?</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith (playing with Lear's emerald):</i>

 <blockquote>                          Did Merryn ...<br>
  Has Merryn been ... She loitered long before she came,<br>
  For I was at the women's bathing-place ere dawn ...<br>
  No jewel in all the land excites me and enthralls<br>
  Like this strong source of light that lives upon your breast.</blockquote><br>


<i>Lear (taking the jewel chain from his neck and slipping it over
Gormflaith's head while she still holds the emerald):</i>

<blockquote>Wear it within your breast to fill the gentle place<br>
That cherished the poor letter lately torn from you.
</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Did Merryn at your bidding, then, forsake her Queen?</blockquote><br>

<i>LEAR nods.</i><br>


<blockquote>You must not, ah, you must not do these masterful things,<br>
Even to grasp a precious meeting for us two;<br>
For the reproach and chiding are so hard to me,<br>
And even you can never fight the silent women<br>
In hidden league against me, all this house of women.<br>
Merryn has left her Queen in unwatched loneliness,<br>
And yet your daughter Princess Goneril has said<br>
(With lips that scarce held back the spittle for my face)<br>
That if the Queen is left again I shall be whipt.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Children speak of the punishments they know.<br>
Her back is now not half so white as yours,<br>
And you shall write your will upon it yet.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Ah, no, my King, my faithful.. Ah, no.. no..<br>
The Princess Goneril is right; she judges me:<br>
A sinful woman cannot steadily gaze reply<br>
To the cool, baffling looks of virgin untried force.<br>
She stands beside that crumbling mother in her hate,<br>
And, though we know so well &mdash; she and I, O we know &mdash; <br>
That she could love no mother nor partake in anguish,<br>
Yet she is flouted when the King forsakes her dam,<br>
She must protect her very flesh, her tenderer flesh,<br>
Although she cannot wince; she's wild in her cold brain,<br>
And soon I must be made to pay a cruel price<br>
For this one gloomy joy in my uncherished life.<br>
Envy and greed are watching me aloof<br>
(Yes, now none of the women will walk with me),<br>
Longing to see me ruined, but she'll do it ...<br>
It is a lonely thing to love a king ...</blockquote><br>

<i>She puts her cheek gradually closer and closer to LEAR'S cheek as she
speaks: at length he kisses her suddenly and vehemently, as if he would
grasp her lips with his: she receives it passively, her head thrown
back, her eyes closed.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Goldilocks, when the crown is couching in your hair<br>
And those two mingled golds brighten each other's wonder,<br>
You shall produce a son from flesh unused &mdash; <br>
Virgin I chose you for that, first crops are strongest &mdash; <br>
A tawny fox with your high-stepping action,<br>
With your untiring power and glittering eyes,<br>
To hold my lands together when I am done,<br>
To keep my lands from crumbling into mouthfuls<br>
For the short jaws of my three mewling vixens.<br>
Hatch for me such a youngster from my seed,<br>
And I and he shall rein my hot-breathed wenches<br>
To let you grind the edges off their teeth.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith (shaking her head sadly):</i>

<blockquote>Life holds no more than this for me; this is my hour.<br>
When she is dead I know you'll buy another Queen &mdash; <br>
Giving a county for her, gaining a duchy with her &mdash; <br>
And put me to wet nursing, leashing me with the thralls.<br>
It will not be unbearable &mdash; I've had your love.<br>
Master and friend, grant then this hour to me:<br>
Never again, maybe, can we two sit<br>
At love together, unwatched, unknown of all,<br>
In the Queen's chamber, near the Queen's crown<br>
And with no conscious Queen to hold it from us:<br>
Now let me wear the Queen's true crown on me<br>
And snatch a breathless knowledge of the feeling<br>
Of what it would have been to sit by you<br>
Always and closely, equal and exalted,<br>
To be my light when life is dark again.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Girl, by the black stone god, I did not think<br>
You had the nature of a chambermaid,<br>
Who pries and fumbles in her lady's clothes<br>
With her red hands, or on her soily neck<br>
Stealthily hangs her lady's jewels or pearls.<br>
You shall be tiring-maid to the next queen<br>
And try her crown on every day o' your life<br>
In secrecy, if that is your desire:<br>
If you would be a queen, cleanse yourself quickly<br>
Of menial fingering and servile thought.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>You need not crown me. Let me put it on<br>
As briefly as a gleam of Winter sun.<br>
I will not even warm it with my hair.</blockquote><br>


<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>You cannot have the nature of a queen<br>
If you believe that there are things above you:<br>
Crowns make no queens, queens are the cause of crowns.</blockquote><br>


<i>Gormflaith (slipping from his knee):</i>

<blockquote>Then I will take one. Look.</blockquote><br>

<i>She tip-toes lightly round the front of the bed to where the crown
hangs on the wall.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Come here, mad thing &mdash; come back!<br>
Your shadow will wake the Queen.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Hush, hush! That angry voice<br>
Will surely wake the Queen.</blockquote><br>

<i>She lifts the crown from the peg, and returns with it.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Go back; bear back the crown:<br>
Hang up the crown again.<br>
We are not helpless serfs<br>
To think things are forbidden<br>
And steal them for our joy.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Hush, hush! It is too late;<br>
I dare not go again.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Put down the crown: your hands are base hands yet.<br>
Give it to me: it issues from my hands.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith (seating herself on his knee again, and crowning herself):</i>

<blockquote>Let anger keep your eyes steady and bright<br>
To be my guiding mirror: do not move.<br>
You have received two queens within your eyes.</blockquote><br>

<i>She laughs clearly, like a bird's sudden song. HYGD awakes and, after
an instant's bewilderment, turns her head toward the sound; finding the
bed-curtain dropt, she moves it aside a little with her fingers; she
watches LEAR and GORMFLAITH for a short time, then the curtain slips
from her weak grasp and she lies motionless.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear (continuing meanwhile):</i>

<blockquote>Doff it ... <i>(GORMFLAITH kisses him.)</i><br>
Enough ... <i>(Kiss)</i> Unless you do ...<br>
<i>(Kiss)</i> my will ... <i>(Kiss)</i><br>
I shall &mdash;  &mdash; <i>(Kiss)</i> I shall &mdash;  &mdash; <i>(Kiss)</i> I'll have you<br>
 ... <i>(Kiss)</i> sent ... <i>(Kiss)</i> to ...<i>(Kiss.)</i></blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Hush</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Come to the garden: you shall hear me there.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>I dare not leave the Queen ... Yes, yes, I come.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>No, you are better here: the guard would see you.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Not when we reach the pathway near the apple-yard.</blockquote><br>

<i>They rise.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Girl, you are changed: you yield more beauty so.</blockquote><br>

<i>They go out hand in hand by the doorway at the back. As they pass the
crumpled letter GORMFLAITH drops her handkerchief on it, then picks up
handkerchief and letter together and thrusts them into her bosom as she
passes out.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Hygd (fingering back the bed-curtain again):</i>

<blockquote>How have they vanished? What are they doing now?</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith (singing outside):</i>

<blockquote>If you have a mind to kiss me<br>
You shall kiss me in the dark:<br>
Yet rehearse, or you might miss me &mdash; <br>
Make my mouth your noontide mark.<br>
See, I prim and pout it so;<br>
Now take aim and ... No, no, no.<br>
Shut your eyes, or you'll not learn<br>
Where the darkness soon shall hide me:<br>
If you will not, then, in turn,<br>
I'll shut mine. Come, have you spied me?</blockquote><br>

<i>GORMFLAITH'S voice grows fainter as the song closes.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>Does he remember love-ways used with me?<br>
Shall I never know? Is it too near?<br>
I'll watch him at his wooing once again,<br>
Though I peer up at him across my grave-sill.</blockquote><br>

<i>She gets out of bed and takes several steps toward the garden doorway;
she totters and sways, then, turning, stumbles back to the bed for
support.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>Limbs, will you die? It is not yet the time.<br>
I know more discipline: I'll make you go.</blockquote><br>

<i>She fumbles along the bed to the head, then, clinging against the wall,
drags herself toward the back of the room.</i><br>
<br>

<blockquote>It is too far. I cannot see the wall.<br>
I will go ten more steps: only ten more.<br>
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.<br>
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.<br>
Sundown is soon to-day: it is cold and dark.<br>
Now ten steps more, and much will have been done.<br>
One. Two. Three. Four. Ten.<br>
Eleven. Twelve. Sixteen. Nineteen. Twenty.<br>
Twenty-one.  Twenty-three.  Twenty-eight. Thirty. Thirty-one.<br>
At last the turn. Thirty-six. Thirty-nine. Forty.<br>
Now only once again. Two. Three.<br>
What do the voices say? I hear too many.<br>
The door: but here there is no garden ... Ah!</blockquote><br>

<i>She holds herself up an instant by the door-curtains; then she reels
and falls, her body in the room, her head and shoulders beyond the
curtains.</i><br>
<br>
<i>GONERIL enters by the door beyond the bed, carrying the filled cup
carefully in both hands.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Where are you? What have you done? Speak to me.</blockquote><br>

<i>Turning and seeing HYGD, she lets the cup fall and leaps to the open
door by the bed.</i><br><br><blockquote>Merryn, hither, hither ... Mother, O mother!</blockquote><br>

<i>She goes to HYGD. MERRYN enters.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>Princess, what has she done? Who has left her?<br>
She must have been alone.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Where is Gormflaith?</blockquote><br>

<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>Mercy o' mercies, everybody asks me<br>
For Gormflaith, then for Gormflaith, then for Gormflaith,<br>
And I ask everybody else for her;<br>
But she is nowhere, and the King will foam.<br>
Send me no more; I am old with running about<br>
After a bodiless name.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril: </i>

<blockquote>She has been here,<br>
And she has left the Queen. This is her deed.
</blockquote><br>

<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>Ah, cruel, cruel! The shame, the pity &mdash; </blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Lift.</blockquote><br>

<i>Together they raise HYGD, and carry her to bed.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>She breathes, but something flitters under her flesh:<br>
Wynoc the leech must help us now. Go, run,<br>
Seek him, and come back quickly, and do not dare<br>
To come without him.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>It is useless, lady:<br>
There's fever at the cowherd's in the marsh,<br>
 And Wynoc broods above it twice a day,<br>
And I have lately seen him hobble thither.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>I never heard such scornful wickedness<br>
As that a king's physician so should choose<br>
To watch and even heal base men and poor &mdash; <br>
And, more than all, when there's a queen a-dying ...</blockquote><br>

<i>Hygd (recovering consciousness):</i>

<blockquote>Whence come you, dearest daughter? What have I done?<br>
Are you a dream? I thought I was alone.<br>
Have you been hunting on the Windy Height?<br>
Your hands are not thus gentle after hunting.<br>
Or have I heard you singing through my sleep?<br>
Stay with me now: I have had piercing thoughts<br>
Of what the ways of life will do to you<br>
To mould and maim you, and I have a power<br>
To bring these to expression that I knew not.<br>
Why do you wear my crown? Why do you wear<br>
My crown I say? Why do you wear my crown?<br>
I am falling, falling! Lift me: hold me up.</blockquote><br>

<i>GONERIL climbs on the bed and supports HYGD against her shoulder.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>It is the bed that breaks, for still I sink.<br>
Grip harder: I am slipping!</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Woman, help!</blockquote><br>

<i>MERRYN hurries round to the front of the bed and supports HYGD on her
other side. HYGD points at the far corner of the room.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>Why is the King's mother standing there?<br>
She should not wear her crown before me now.<br>
Send her away, she had a savage mind.<br>
Will you not hang a shawl across the corner<br>
So that she cannot stare at me again?</blockquote><br>

<i>With a rending sob she buries her face in GONERIL'S bosom.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>Ah, she is coming! Do not let her touch me!<br>
Brave splendid daughter, how easily you save me:<br>
But soon will Gormflaith come, she stays for ever.<br>
O, will she bring my crown to me once more?<br>
Yes, Gormflaith, yes ... Daughter, pay Gormflaith well.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Gormflaith has left you lonely:<br>
'Tis Gormflaith who shall pay.
</blockquote><br>

<i>Hygd:</i>

<blockquote>No, Gormflaith; Gormflaith ... Not my loneliness ...<br>
Everything ... Pay Gormflaith ...</blockquote><br>

<i>Her head falls back over GONERIL'S shoulder and she dies.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Goneril (laying Hygd down in bed again):</i>

<blockquote>Send horsemen to the marshes for the leech,<br>
And let them bind him on a horse's back<br>
And bring him swiftlier than an old man rides.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>This is no leech's work: she's a dead woman.<br>
I'd best be finding if the wisdom-women<br>
Have come from Brita's child-bed to their drinking<br>
By the cook's fire, for soon she'll be past handling.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>This is not death: death could not be like this.<br>
She is quite warm &mdash; though nothing moves in her.<br>
I did not know death could come all at once:<br>
If life is so ill-seated no one is safe.<br>
Cannot we leave her like herself awhile?<br>
Wait awhile, Merryn ... No, no, no; not yet!</blockquote><br>

<i>Merryn:</i>

<blockquote>Child, she is gone and will not come again<br>
However we cover our faces and pretend<br>
She will be there if we uncover them.<br>
I must be hasty, or she'll be as stiff<br>
As a straw mattress is.
</blockquote><br>

<i>She hurries out by the door near the bed.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Goneril (throwing the whole length of her body along Hygd's body, and
        embracing it):</i>

<blockquote>Come back, come back; the things I have not done<br>
Beat in upon my brain from every side:<br>
I know not where to put myself to bear them:<br>
If I could have you now I could act well.<br>
My inward life, deeds that you have not known,<br>
I burn to tell you in a sudden dread<br>
That now your ghost discovers them in me.<br>
Hearken, mother; between us there's a bond<br>
Of flesh and essence closer than love can cause:<br>
It cannot be unknit so soon as this,<br>
And you must know my touch,<br>
And you shall yield a sign.<br>
Feel, feel this urging throb: I call to you ...</blockquote><br>

<i>GORMFLAITH, still crowned, enters by the garden doorway.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>Come back! Help me and shield me!</blockquote><br>

<i>She disappears through the curtains. GONERIL has sprung to her feet at
the first sound of GORMFLAITH'S voice.

LEAR enters through the garden doorway, leading GORMFLAITH by the hand.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear: </i>

<i>Goneril (advancing to meet them with a deep obeisance):</i>

<blockquote>O, Sir, the Queen is dead: long live the Queen,<br>
You have been ready with the coronation.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>What do you mean? Young madam, will you mock?</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>But is not she your choice?<br>
The old Queen thought so, for I found her here,<br>
Lipping the prints of her supplanter's feet,<br>
Prostrate in homage, on her face, silent.<br>
I tremble within to have seen her fallen down.<br>
I must be pardoned if I scorn your ways:<br>
You cannot know this feeling that I know,<br>
You are not of her kin or house; but I<br>
Share blood with her, and, though she grew too worn<br>
To be your Queen, she was my mother, Sir.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>The Queen has seen me.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>She is safe in bed.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Do not speak low: your voice sounds guilty so;<br>
And there is no more need &mdash; she will not wake.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>She cannot sleep for ever. When she wakes<br>
I will announce my purpose in the need<br>
Of Britain for a prince to follow me,<br>
And tell her that she is to be deposed ...<br>
What have you done? She is not breathing now.<br>
She breathed here lately. Is she truly dead?</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Your graceful consort steals from us too soon:<br>
Will you not tell her that she should remain &mdash; <br>
If she can trust the faith you keep with a queen?</blockquote><br>

<i>She steps to GORMFLAITH, who is sidling toward the garden door-way,
and, taking her hand, leads her to the foot of the bed.</i><br>
<br>

<blockquote>Lady, why will you go? The King intends<br>
That you shall soon be royal, and thereby<br>
Admitted to our breed: then stay with us<br>
In this domestic privacy to mourn<br>
The grief here fallen on our family.<br>
Kneel now; I yield the eldest daughter's place.<br>
Why do you fumble in your bosom so?<br>
Put your cold hands together; close your eyes,<br>
In inward isolation to assemble<br>
Your memories of the dead, your prayers for her.</blockquote><br>

<i>She turns to LEAR, who has approached the bed and drawn back the
curtain.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>What utterance of doom would the king use<br>
Upon a watchman in the castle garth<br>
Who left his gate and let an enemy in?<br>
The watcher by the Queen thus left her station:<br>
The sick bruised Queen is dead of that neglect.<br>
And what should be the doom on a seducer<br>
Who drew that sentinel from his fixt watch?</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>She had long been dying, and she would have died<br>
Had all her dutiful daughters tended her bed.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Yes, she had long been dying in her heart.<br>
She lived to see you give her crown away;<br>
She died to see you fondle a menial:<br>
These blows you dealt now, but what elder wounds<br>
Received them to such purpose suddenly?<br>
What had you caused her to remember most?<br>
What things would she be like to babble over<br>
In the wild helpless hour when fitful life<br>
No more can choose what thoughts it shall encourage<br>
In the tost mind? She has suffered you twice over,<br>
Your animal thoughts and hungry powers, this day,<br>
Until I knew you unkingly and untrue.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Punishment once taught you daughterly silence;<br>
It shall be tried again ... What has she said?
</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>You cannot touch me now I know your nature:<br>
Your force upon my mind was only terrible<br>
When I believed you a cruel flawless man.<br>
Ruler of lands and dreaded judge of men,<br>
Now you have done a murder with your mind<br>
Can you see any murderer put to death?<br>
Can you &mdash; </blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>What has she said?</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Continue in your joy of punishing evil,<br>
Your passion of just revenge upon wrong-doers,<br>
Unkingly and untrue?</blockquote>


<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Enough: what do you know?</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>That which could add a further agony<br>
To the last agony, the daily poison<br>
Of her late, withering life; but never word    <br>
Of fairer hours or any lost delight.       <br>
Have you no memory, either, of her youth,<br>
While she was still to use, spoil, forsake,<br>
That maims your new contentment with a longing<br>
For what is gone and will not come again?</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>I did not know that she could die to-day.<br>
She had a bloodless beauty that cheated me:<br>
She was not born for wedlock. She shut me out.<br>
She is no colder now ... I'll hear no more.<br>
You shall be answered afterward for this.<br>
Put something over her: get her buried:<br>
I will not look on her again.</blockquote><br>

<i>He breaks from GONERIL and flings abruptly out by the door near the bed.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>My king, you leave me!</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Soon we follow him:<br>
But, ah, poor fragile beauty, you cannot rise<br>
While this grave burden weights your drooping head.</blockquote><br>

<i>Laying her hand caressingly on GORMFLAITH'S neck, she gradually forces
her head farther and farther down.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>You were not nurtured to sustain a crown,<br>
Your unanointed parents could not breed<br>
The spirit that ten hundred years must ripen.<br>
Lo, how you sink and fail.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith:</i>

<blockquote>You had best take care,<br>
For where my neck has bruises yours shall have wounds.<br>
The King knows of your wolfish snapping at me:<br>
He will protect me.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Ay, if he is in time.</blockquote><br>

<i>Gormflaith (taking off the crown and holding it up blindly toward
Goneril with one hand):</i>

<blockquote>Take it and let me go!</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Nay, not to me:<br>
You are the Queen's, to serve her even in death.<br>
Yield her her own. Approach her: do not fear;<br>
She will not chide you or forgive you now.<br>
Go on your knees; the crown still holds you down.</blockquote><br>

<i>GORMFLAITH stumbles forward on her knees and lays the crown on the bed,
then crouches motionlessly against the bedside.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Goneril (taking the crown and putting it on the dead Queen's head):</i>

<blockquote>Mother and Queen, to you this holiest circlet<br>
Returns, by you renews its purpose and pride;<br>
Though it is sullied with a menial warmth,<br>
Your august coldness shall rehallow it,<br>
And when the young lewd blood that lent it heat<br>
Is also cooler we can well forget.</blockquote><br>

<i>She steps to GORMFLAITH.</i><br><br>


<blockquote>Rise. Come, for here there is no more to do,<br>
And let us seek your chamber, if you will,<br>
There to confer in greater privacy;<br>
For we have now interment to prepare.</blockquote><br>

<i>She leads GORMFLAITH to the door near the bed.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>You must walk first, you are still the Queen elect.</blockquote><br>

<i>When GORMFLAITH has passed before her GONERIL unsheathes her hunting
knife.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Gormflaith (turning in the doorway):</i>

<blockquote>What will you do?</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril (thrusting her forward with the haft of the knife):</i>

<blockquote>On. On. On. Go in.</blockquote><br>

<i>She follows GORMFLAITH out. After a moment's interval two elderly
women, one a little younger than the other, enter by the same door: they
wear black hoods and shapeless black gowns with large sleeves that flap
like the wings of ungainly birds: between them they carry a heavy
cauldron of hot water.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Younger Woman:</i>

<blockquote>We were listening. We were listening.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Elder Woman:</i>

<blockquote>We were both listening.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Younger Woman:</i>

<blockquote> Did she struggle?</blockquote><br>

<i>The Elder Woman:</i>

<blockquote>She could not struggle long.</blockquote><br>

<i>They set down the cauldron at the foot of the bed.]</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Elder Woman (curtseying to the Queen's body):</i>

<blockquote>Saving your presence, Madam, we are come<br>
To make you sweeter than you'll be hereafter,<br>
And then be done with you.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Younger Woman (curtseying in turn):</i>

<blockquote>Three days together, my Lady, y'have had me ducked<br>
For easing a foolish maid at the wrong time;<br>
But now your breath is stopped and you are colder,<br>
And you shall be as wet as a drowned rat<br>
Ere I have done with you.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Elder Woman (fumbling in the folds of the robe that hangs on the
wall):</i>

<blockquote>Her pocket is empty; Merryn has been here first.<br>
Hearken, and then begin:<br>
You have not touched a royal corpse before,<br>
But I have stretched a king and an old queen,<br>
A king's aunt and a king's brother too,<br>
Without much boasting of a still-born princess;<br>
So that I know, as a priest knows his prayers,<br>
All that is written in the chamberlain's book<br>
About the handling of exalted corpses,<br>
Stripping them and trussing them for the grave:<br>
And there it says that the chief corpse-washer<br>
Shall take for her own use by sacred right<br>
The coverlid, the upper sheet, the mattress<br>
Of any bed in which a queen has died,<br>
And the last robe of state the body wore;<br>
While humbler helpers may divide among them<br>
The under sheet, the pillow, and the bed-gown<br>
Stript from the cooling queen.<br>
Be thankful, then, and praise me every day<br>
That I have brought no other women with me<br>
To spoil you of your share.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Younger Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Ah, you have always been a friend to me:    <br>
Many's the time I have said I did not know<br>
How I could even have lived but for your kindness.</blockquote><br>

<i>The ELDER WOMAN draws down the bedclothes from the Queen's body,
loosens them from the bed, and throws them on the floor.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Elder Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Pull her feet straight: is your mind wandering?</blockquote><br>

<i>She commences to fold the bedclothes, singing as she moves about.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>A louse crept out of my lady's shift &mdash; <br>
Ahumm, Ahumm, Ahee &mdash; <br>
Crying "Oi! Oi! We are turned adrift;<br>
The lady's bosom is cold and stiffed,<br>
And her arm-pit's cold for me."</blockquote><br>

<i>While the ELDER WOMAN sings, the YOUNGER WOMAN straightens the Queen's
feet and ties them together, draws the pillow from under her head,
gathers her hair in one hand and knots it roughly; then she loosens her
nightgown, revealing a jewel hung on a cord round the Queen's neck.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Elder Woman (running to the vacant side of the bed):</i>

<blockquote>What have you there? Give it to me.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Younger Woman: </i>

<blockquote>It is mine:<br>
I found it.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Elder Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Leave it.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Younger Woman: </i>

<blockquote>Let go.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Elder Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Leave it, I say.<br>
  Will you not? Will you not? An eye for a jewel, then!</blockquote><br>

<i>She attacks the face of the YOUNGER WOMAN with her disengaged hand.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Younger Woman (starting back):</i>

<blockquote> Oh!</blockquote><br>

<i>The ELDER WOMAN breaks the cord and thrusts the jewel into her pocket.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Younger Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Aie! Aie! Aie! Old thief! You are always thieving!<br>
You stole a necklace on your wedding day:<br>
You could not bear a child, you stole your daughter:<br>
You stole a shroud the morn your husband died:<br>
Last week you stole the Princess Regan's comb...</blockquote><br>

<i>She stumbles into the chair by the bed, and, throwing her loose sleeves
over her head, rocks herself and moans.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Elder Woman (resuming her clothes-folding and her song):</i>

<blockquote>"The lady's linen's no longer neat;" &mdash; <br>
Ahumm, Ahumm, Ahee &mdash; <br>
"Her savour is neither warm nor sweet;<br>
It's close for two in a winding sheet,<br>
And lice are too good for worms to eat;<br>
So here's no place for me."</blockquote><br>

<i>GONERIL enters by the door near the bed: her knife and the hand that
holds it are bloody. She pauses a moment irresolutely.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Elder Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Still work for old Hrogneda, little Princess?</blockquote><br>
<br>
<i>GONERIL goes straight to the cauldron, passing the women as if they
were not there: she kneels and washes her knife and her hand in it. The
women retire to the back of the chamber.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Goneril (speaking to herself):</i>

<blockquote>The way is easy: and it is to be used.<br>
How could this need have been conceived slowly?<br>
In a keen mind it should have leapt and burnt:<br>
What I have done would have been better done<br>
When my sad mother lived and could feel joy.<br>
This striking without thought is better than hunting;<br>
She showed more terror than an animal,<br>
She was more shiftless ...<br>
A little blood is lightly washed away,<br>
A common stain that need not be remembered;<br>
And a hot spasm of rightness quickly born<br>
Can guide me to kill justly and shall guide.</blockquote><br>

<i>LEAR enters by the door near the bed.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Goneril, Gormflaith, Gormflaith ... Have you seen Gormflaith?</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>I led her to her chamber lately, Sir.</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Ay, she is in her chamber. She is there.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Have you been there already? Could you not wait?</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>Daughter, she is bleeding: she is slain.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril (rising from the cauldron with dripping hands):</i>

<blockquote>Yes, she is slain: I did it with a knife:<br>
And in this water is dissolved her blood,</blockquote><br>

<i>(Raising her arms and sprinkling the Queen's body)</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>That now I scatter on the Queen of death<br>
For signal to her spirit that I can slake<br>
Her long corrosion of misery with such balm &mdash; <br>
Blood for weeping, terror for woe, death for death,<br>
A broken body for a broken heart.<br>
What will you say against me and my deed?</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>That now you cannot save yourself from me.<br>
While your blind virgin power still stood apart<br>
In an unused, unviolated life,<br>
You judged me in my weakness, and because<br>
I felt you unflawed I could not answer you;<br>
But you have mingled in mortality<br>
And violently begun the common life<br>
By fault against your fellows; and the state,<br>
The state of Britain that inheres in me<br>
Not touched by my humanity or sin,<br>
Passions or privy acts, shall be as hard<br>
And savage to you as to a murderess.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril (taking a letter from her girdle):</i>

<blockquote>I found a warrant in her favoured bosom, King:<br>
She wore this on her heart when you were crowning her.
</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>But this is not my hand:</blockquote><br>

<i>(Looking about him on the floor)</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>Where is the other letter?</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Is there another letter? What should it say?</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>There is no other letter if you have none.<br>
                                   <i>(Reading)</i><br>
"Open your window when the moon is dead,<br>
And I will come again.<br>
The men say everywhere that you are faithless ...<br>
And your eyes shifty eyes. Ah, but I love you, Gormflaith." ...<br>
This is not hers: she'd not receive such words.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>Her name stands twice therein: her perfume fills it:<br>
My knife went through it ere I found it on her.
</blockquote><br>

<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>The filth is suitably dead. You are my true daughter.</blockquote><br>

<i>Goneril:</i>

<blockquote>I do not understand how men can govern,<br>
Use craft and exercise the duty of cunning,<br>
Anticipate treason, treachery meet with treachery,<br>
And yet believe a woman because she looks<br>
Straight in their eyes with mournful, trustful gaze,<br>
And lisps like innocence, all gentleness.<br>
Your Gormflaith could not answer a woman's eyes.<br>
I did not need to read her in a letter;<br>
I am not woman yet, but I can feel<br>
What untruths are instinctive in my kind,<br>
And how some men desire deceit from us.<br>
Come; let these washers do what they must do:<br>
Or shall your Queen be wrapped and coffined awry?</blockquote><br>

<i>She goes out by the garden doorway.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Lear:</i>

<blockquote>I thought she had been broken long ago:<br>
She must be wedded and broken, I cannot do it.</blockquote><br>

<i>He follows GONERIL out. The two women return to the bedside.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Elder Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Poor, masterful King, he is no easier,<br>
Although his tearful wife is gone at last:<br>
A wilful girl shall prick and thwart him now.<br>
Old gossip, we must hasten; the Queen is setting.<br>
Lend me a pair of pennies to weight her eyes.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Younger Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Find your own pennies: then you can steal them safely.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Elder Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Praise you the gods of Britain, as I do praise them,<br>
That I have been sweet-natured from my birth,<br>
And that I lack your unforgiving mind.<br>
Friend of the worms, help me to lift her clear<br>
And draw away the under sheet for you;<br>
Then go and spread the shroud by the hall fire &mdash; <br>
I never could put damp linen on a corpse.</blockquote><br>

<i>She sings.</i>

<blockquote>The louse made off unhappy and wet; &mdash; <br>
Ahumm, Ahumm, Ahee &mdash; <br>
He's looking for us, the little pet;<br>
So haste, for her chin's to tie up yet,<br>
And let us be gone with what we can get &mdash; <br>
Her ring for thee, her gown for Bet,<br>
Her pocket turned out for me.</blockquote><br>

Comes our immortality.<br>
Mamua, there waits a land<br>
Hard for us to understand.<br>
Out of time, beyond the sun,<br>
All are one in Paradise,<br>
You and Pupure are one,<br>
And Taû, and the ungainly wise.<br>
There the Eternals are, and there<br>
The Good, the Lovely, and the True,<br>
And Types, whose earthly copies were<br>
The foolish broken things we knew;<br>
There is the Face, whose ghosts we are;<br>
The real, the never-setting Star;<br>
And the Flower, of which we love<br>
Faint and fading shadows here;<br>
Never a tear, but only Grief;<br>
Dance, but not the limbs that move;<br>
Songs in Song shall disappear;<br>
Instead of lovers, Love shall be;<br>
For hearts, Immutability;<br>
And there, on the Ideal Reef,<br>
Thunders the Everlasting Sea!<br><br>

And my laughter, and my pain,<br>
Shall home to the Eternal Brain;<br>
And all lovely things, they say,<br>
Meet in Loveliness again;<br>
Miri's laugh, Teìpo's feet,<br>
And the hands of Matua,<br>
Stars and sunlight there shall meet,<br>
Coral's hues and rainbows there,<br>
And Teilra's braided hair;<br>
And with the starred <i>tiare's</i> white,<br>

And <i>flamboyants</i> ablaze at night,<br>
And jewels, and evening's after-green,<br>
And dawns of pearl and gold and red,<br>
Mamua, your lovelier head!<br>
And there'll no more be one who dreams<br>
Under the ferns, of crumbling stuff,<br>
Eyes of illusion, mouth that seems,<br>
All time-entangled human love.<br>
And you'll no longer swing and sway<br>
Divinely down the scented shade,<br>
Where feet to Ambulation fade,<br>
And moons are lost in endless Day.<br>
How shall we wind these wreaths of ours,<br>
Where there are neither heads nor flowers?<br>
Oh, Heaven's Heaven! &mdash; but we'll be missing<br>
The palms, and sunlight, and the south;<br>
And there's an end, I think, of kissing,<br>
When our mouths are one with Mouth ...<br><br>

<i>Taû here</i>, Mamua,       <br>
Crown the hair, and come away!<br>
Hear the calling of the moon,<br>
And the whispering scents that stray<br>
About the idle warm lagoon.<br>
Hasten, hand in human hand,<br>
Down the dark, the flowered way,<br>
Along the whiteness of the sand,<br>
And in the water's soft caress,<br>
Wash the mind of foolishness,<br>
Mamua, until the day.<br>
Spend the glittering moonlight there<br>
Pursuing down the soundless deep<br>
Limbs that gleam and shadowy hair,<br>
Or floating lazy, half-asleep.<br>
Dive and double and follow after,<br>
Snare in flowers, and kiss, and call,<br>
With lips that fade, and human laughter,<br>
And faces individual,<br>
Well this side of Paradise!...<br>
There's little comfort in the wise.</blockquote>

<a name="grlov"></a><h3>The Great Lover</h3>

<blockquote>I have been so great a lover: filled my days<br>
So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,<br>
The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,<br>
Desire illimitable, and still content,<br>
And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,<br>
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear<br>
Our hearts at random down the dark of life.<br>
Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife<br>
Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,<br>
My night shall be remembered for a star<br>
That outshone all the suns of all men's days.<br>
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise<br>
Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me<br>
High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see<br>
The inenarrable godhead of delight?<br>
Love is a flame; &mdash; we have beaconed the world's night.<br>
A city: &mdash; and we have built it, these and I.<br>
An emperor: &mdash; we have taught the world to die.<br>
So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,<br>
And the high cause of Love's magnificence,<br>
And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names<br>
Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,<br>
And set them as a banner, that men may know,<br>
To dare the generations, burn, and blow<br>
Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming ...<br><br>

These I have loved:<br>
    White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,<br>
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;<br>
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust<br>
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;<br>
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;<br>
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;<br>
And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,<br>
Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;<br>
Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon<br>
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss<br>
Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is<br>
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen<br>
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;<br>
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;<br>
The good smell of old clothes; and other such &mdash; <br>
The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,<br>
Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers<br>
About dead leaves and last year's ferns ...<br>
                                 Dear names,<br>
And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;<br>
Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;<br>
Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;<br>
Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,<br>
Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;<br>
Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam<br>
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;<br>
And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold<br>
Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;<br>
Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;<br>
And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;<br>
And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass; &mdash; <br>
All these have been my loves. And these shall pass,<br>
Whatever passes not, in the great hour,<br>
Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power<br>
To hold them with me through the gate of Death.<br>
They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,<br>
Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust<br>
And sacramented covenant to the dust.<br>
 &mdash; Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,<br>
And give what's left of love again, and make<br>
New friends, now strangers...<br>
                           But the best I've known,<br>
Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown<br>
About the winds of the world, and fades from brains<br>
Of living men, and dies.<br>
                        Nothing remains.<br><br>

O dear my loves, O faithless, once again<br>
This one last gift I give: that after men<br>
Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,<br>
Praise you, 'All these were lovely'; say, 'He loved.'</blockquote><br>

Till, climbing slowly on her way,<br>
She vanished, and was gone.</blockquote>

<a name="offgr"></a><h3>Off the Ground</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Three jolly Farmers<br>
Once bet a pound<br>
Each dance the others would<br>
Off the ground.<br>
Out of their coats<br>
They slipped right soon,<br>
And neat and nicesome<br>
Put each his shoon.<br>
One &mdash; Two &mdash; Three!<br>
And away they go,<br>
Not too fast,<br>
And not too slow;<br>
Out from the elm-tree's<br>
Noonday shadow,<br>
Into the sun<br>
And across the meadow.<br>
Past the schoolroom,<br>
With knees well bent,<br>
Fingers a-flicking,<br>
They dancing went.<br>
Up sides and over,<br>
And round and round,<br>
They crossed click-clacking<br>
The Parish bound;<br>
By Tupman's meadow<br>
They did their mile,<br>
Tee-to-tum<br>
On a three-barred stile.<br>
Then straight through Whipham,<br>
Downhill to Week,<br>
Footing it lightsome,<br>
But not too quick,<br>
Up fields to Watchet,<br>
And on through Wye,<br>
Till seven fine churches<br>
They'd seen skip by &mdash; <br>
Seven fine churches,<br>
And five old mills,<br>
Farms in the valley,<br>
And sheep on the hills;<br>
Old Man's Acre<br>
And Dead Man's Pool<br>
All left behind,<br>
As they danced through Wool.<br>
And Wool gone by,<br>
Like tops that seem<br>
To spin in sleep<br>
They danced in dream:<br>
Withy &mdash; Wellover &mdash; <br>
Wassop &mdash; Wo &mdash; <br>
Like an old clock<br>
Their heels did go.<br>
A league and a league<br>
And a league they went,<br>
And not one weary,<br>
And not one spent.<br>
And lo, and behold!<br>
Past Willow-cum-Leigh<br>
Stretched with its waters<br>
The great green sea.<br>
Says Farmer Bates,<br>
'I puffs and I blows,<br>
What's under the water,<br>
Why, no man knows!'<br>
Says Farmer Giles,<br>
'My mind comes weak,<br>
And a good man drowned<br>
Is far to seek.'<br>
But Farmer Turvey,<br>
On twirling toes,<br>
Up's with his gaiters,<br>
And in he goes:<br>
Down where the mermaids<br>
Pluck and play<br>
On their twangling harps<br>
In a sea-green day;<br>
Down where the mermaids,<br>
Finned and fair,<br>
Sleek with their combs<br>
Their yellow hair ...<br>
Bates and Giles &mdash; <br>
On the shingle sat,<br>
Gazing at Turvey's<br>
Floating hat.<br>
But never a ripple<br>
Nor bubble told<br>
Where he was supping<br>
Off plates of gold.<br>
Never an echo<br>
Rilled through the sea<br>
Of the feasting and dancing<br>
And minstrelsy.<br>
They called &mdash; called &mdash; called:<br>
Came no reply:<br>
Nought but the ripples'<br>
Sandy sigh.<br>
Then glum and silent<br>
They sat instead,<br>
Vacantly brooding<br>
On home and bed,<br>
Till both together<br>
Stood up and said: &mdash; <br>
'Us knows not, dreams not,<br>
Where you be,<br>
Turvey, unless<br>
In the deep blue sea;<br>
But axcusing silver &mdash; <br>
And it comes most willing &mdash; <br>
Here's us two paying<br>
Our forty shilling;<br>
For it's sartin sure, Turvey,<br>
Safe and sound,<br>
You danced us square, Turvey,<br>
Off the ground!'</blockquote>

Is but a drab inglorious street,<br>
Yet there the frost and clean starlight<br>
As over Warwick woods are sweet.<br><br>

Under the grey drift of the town<br>

As eagerly as those that crown<br>
The Warwick spring in flame and gold.<br><br>

And when the tramway down the hill<br>
Across the cobbles moans and rings,<br>

<blockquote>For peace, than knowledge more desirable,<br>
  Into your Sussex quietness I came,<br>
When summer's green and gold and azure fell<br>
  Over the world in flame.<br><br>

And peace upon your pasture-lands I found,<br>
  Where grazing flocks drift on continually,<br>
As little clouds that travel with no sound<br>
  Across a windless sky.<br><br>

Out of your oaks the birds call to their mates<br>
  That brood among the pines, where hidden deep<br>
From curious eyes a world's adventure waits<br>
  In columned choirs of sleep.<br><br>

Under the calm ascension of the night<br>
  We heard the mellow lapsing and return<br>
Of night-owls purring in their groundling flight<br>
  Through lanes of darkling fern.<br><br>

Unbroken peace when all the stars were drawn<br>
  Back to their lairs of light, and ranked along<br>
From shire to shire the downs out of the dawn<br>

The very winds to threnodies are wrought<br>
That on your downlands blow.<br><br>

I came among your roses and your corn?<br>
Then momently amid this wrath I pray<br>
For yesterday reborn.</blockquote><br>

<a name="carvst"></a><h3>Tha Carver in Stone</h3>

<blockquote>He was a man with wide and patient eyes,<br>
Grey, like the drift of twitch-fires blown in June,<br>
That, without fearing, searched if any wrong<br>
Might threaten from your heart. Grey eyes he had<br>
Under a brow was drawn because he knew<br>
So many seasons to so many pass<br>
Of upright service, loyal, unabased<br>
Before the world seducing, and so, barren<br>
Of good words praising and thought that mated his.<br>
He carved in stone. Out of his quiet life<br>
He watched as any faithful seaman charged<br>
With tidings of the myriad faring sea,<br>
And thoughts and premonitions through his mind<br>
Sailing as ships from strange and storied lands<br>
His hungry spirit held, till all they were<br>
Found living witness in the chiselled stone.<br>
Slowly out of the dark confusion, spread<br>
By life's innumerable venturings<br>
Over his brain, he would triumph into the light<br>
Of one clear mood, unblemished of the blind<br>
Legions of errant thought that cried about<br>
His rapt seclusion: as a pearl unsoiled,<br>
Nay, rather washed to lonelier chastity,<br>
In gritty mud. And then would come a bird,<br>
A flower, or the wind moving upon a flower,<br>
A beast at pasture, or a clustered fruit,<br>
A peasant face as were the saints of old,<br>
The leer of custom, or the bow of the moon<br>
Swung in miraculous poise &mdash; some stray from the world<br>
Of things created by the eternal mind<br>
In joy articulate. And his perfect mood<br>
Would dwell about the token of God's mood,<br>
Until in bird or flower or moving wind<br>
Or flock or shepherd or the troops of heaven<br>
It sprang in one fierce moment of desire<br>
To visible form.<br>
Then would his chisel work among the stone,<br>
Persuading it of petal or of limb<br>
Or starry curve, till risen anew there sang<br>
Shape out of chaos, and again the vision<br>
Of one mind single from the world was pressed<br>
Upon the daily custom of the sky<br>
Or field or the body of man.<br><br>

                              His people<br>
Had many gods for worship. The tiger-god,<br>
The owl, the dewlapped bull, the running pard,<br>
The camel, and the lizard of the slime,<br>
The ram with quivering fleece and fluted horn,<br>
The crested eagle and the doming bat<br>
Were sacred. And the king and his high priests<br>
Decreed a temple, wide on columns huge,<br>
Should top the cornlands to the sky's far line.<br>
They bade the carvers carve along the walls<br>
Images of their gods, each one to carve<br>
As he desired, his choice to name his god ...<br>
And many came; and he among them, glad<br>
Of three leagues' travel through the singing air<br>
Of dawn among the boughs yet bare of green,<br>
The eager flight of the spring leading his blood<br>
Into swift lofty channels of the air,<br>
Proud as an eagle riding to the sun ...<br>
An eagle, clean of pinion &mdash; there's his choice.<br><br>

Daylong they worked under the growing roof,<br>
One at his leopard, one the staring ram,<br>
And he winning his eagle from the stone,<br>
Until each man had carved one image out,<br>
Arow beyond the portal of the house.<br><br>

They stood arow, the company of gods,<br>
Camel and bat, lizard and bull and ram,<br>
The pard and owl, dead figures on the wall,<br>
Figures of habit driven on the stone<br>
By chisels governed by no heat of the brain<br>
But drudges of hands that moved by easy rule.<br>
Proudly recorded mood was none, no thought<br>
Plucked from the dark battalions of the mind<br>
And throned in everlasting sight. But one<br>
God of them all was witness of belief<br>
And large adventure dared. His eagle spread<br>
Wide pinions on a cloudless ground of heaven,<br>
Glad with the heart's high courage of that dawn<br>
Moving upon the ploughlands newly sown,<br>
Dead stone the rest. He looked, and knew it so.<br><br>

Then came the king with priests and counsellors<br>
And many chosen of the people, wise<br>
With words weary of custom, and eyes askew<br>
That watched their neighbour face for any news<br>
Of the best way of judgment, till, each sure<br>
None would determine with authority,<br>
All spoke in prudent praise. One liked the owl<br>
Because an owl blinked on the beam of his barn.<br>
One, hoarse with crying gospels in the street,<br>
Praised most the ram, because the common folk<br>
Wore breeches made of ram's wool. One declared<br>
The tiger pleased him best, &mdash; the man who carved<br>
The tiger-god was halt out of the womb &mdash; <br>
A man to praise, being so pitiful.<br>
And one, whose eyes dwelt in a distant void,<br>
With spell and omen pat upon his lips,<br>
And a purse for any crystal prophet ripe,<br>
A zealot of the mist, gazed at the bull &mdash; <br>
A lean ill-shapen bull of meagre lines<br>
That scarce the steel had graved upon the stone &mdash;  <br>
Saying that here was very mystery       <br>
And truth, did men but know. And one there was<br>
Who praised his eagle, but remembering<br>
The lither pinion of the swift, the curve<br>
That liked him better of the mirrored swan.<br>
And they who carved the tiger-god and ram,<br>
The camel and the pard, the owl and bull,<br>
And lizard, listened greedily, and made<br>
Humble denial of their worthiness,<br>
And when the king his royal judgment gave<br>
That all had fashioned well, and bade that each<br>
Re-shape his chosen god along the walls<br>
Till all the temple boasted of their skill,<br>
They bowed themselves in token that as this<br>
Never had carvers been so fortunate.<br><br>

Only the man with wide and patient eyes<br>
Made no denial, neither bowed his head.<br>
Already while they spoke his thoughts had gone<br>
Far from his eagle, leaving it for a sign<br>
Loyally wrought of one deep breath of life,<br>
And played about the image of a toad<br>
That crawled among his ivy leaves. A queer<br>
Puff-bellied toad, with eyes that always stared<br>
Sidelong at heaven and saw no heaven there,<br>
Weak-hammed, and with a throttle somehow twisted<br>
Beyond full wholesome draughts of air, and skin<br>
Of wrinkled lips, the only zest or will<br>
The little flashing tongue searching the leaves.<br>
And king and priest, chosen and counsellor,<br>
Babbling out of their thin and jealous brains,<br>
Seemed strangely one; a queer enormous toad<br>
Panting under giant leaves of dark,<br>
Sunk in the loins, peering into the day.<br><br>

Their judgment wry he counted not for wrong<br>
More than the fabled poison of the toad<br>
Striking at simple wits; how should their thought<br>
Or word in praise or blame come near the peace<br>
That shone in seasonable hours above<br>
The patience of his spirit's husbandry?<br>
They foolish and not seeing, how should he<br>
Spend anger there or fear &mdash; great ceremonies<br>
Equal for none save great antagonists?<br>
The grave indifference of his heart before them<br>
Was moved by laughter innocent of hate,<br>
Chastising clean of spite, that moulded them<br>
Into the antic likeness of his toad<br>
Bidding for laughter underneath the leaves.<br><br>

He bowed not, nor disputed, but he saw<br>
Those ill-created joyless gods, and loathed,<br>
And saw them creeping, creeping round the walls,<br>
Death breeding death, wile witnessing to wile,<br>
And sickened at the dull iniquity<br>
Should be rewarded, and for ever breathe<br>
Contagion on the folk gathered in prayer.<br>
His truth should not be doomed to march among<br>
This falsehood to the ages. He was called,<br>
And he must labour there; if so the king<br>
Would grant it, where the pillars bore the roof<br>
A galleried way of meditation nursed<br>
Secluded time, with wall of ready stone<br>
In panels for the carver set between<br>
The windows &mdash; there his chisel should be set, &mdash; <br>
It was his plea. And the king spoke of him,<br>
Scorning, as one lack-fettle, among all these<br>
Eager to take the riches of renown;<br>
One fearful of the light or knowing nothing<br>
Of light's dimension, a witling who would throw<br>
Honour aside and praise spoken aloud<br>
All men of heart should covet. Let him go<br>
Grubbing out of the sight of those who knew<br>
The worth of substance; there was his proper trade.<br><br>

A squat and curious toad indeed ... The eyes,<br>
Patient and grey, were dumb as were the lips,<br>
That, fixed and governed, hoarded from them all<br>
The larger laughter lifting in his heart.<br>
Straightway about his gallery he moved,<br>
Measured the windows and the virgin stone,<br>
Till all was weighed and patterned in his brain.<br>
Then first where most the shadows struck the wall,<br>
Under the sills, and centre of the base,<br>
From floor to sill out of the stone was wooed<br>
Memorial folly, as from the chisel leapt<br>
His chastening laughter searching priest and king &mdash; <br>
Huge and wrinkled toad, with legs asplay,<br>
And belly loaded, leering with great eyes<br>
Busily fixed upon the void.<br><br>

                               All days<br>
His chisel was the first to ring across<br>
The temple's quiet; and at fall of dusk<br>
Passing among the carvers homeward, they<br>
Would speak of him as mad, or weak against<br>
The challenge of the world, and let him go<br>
Lonely, as was his will, under the night<br>
Of stars or cloud or summer's folded sun,<br>
Through crop and wood and pasture-land to sleep.<br>
None took the narrow stair as wondering<br>
How did his chisel prosper in the stone,<br>
Unvisited his labour and forgot.<br>
And times when he would lean out of his height<br>
And watch the gods growing along the walls,<br>
The row of carvers in their linen coats<br>
Took in his vision a virtue that alone<br>
Carving they had not nor the thing they carved.<br>
Knowing the health that flowed about his close<br>
Imagining, the daily quiet won<br>
From process of his clean and supple craft,<br>
Those carvers there, far on the floor below,<br>
Would haply be transfigured in his thought<br>
Into a gallant company of men<br>
Glad of the strict and loyal reckoning<br>
That proved in the just presence of the brain<br>
Each chisel-stroke. How surely would he prosper<br>
In pleasant talk at easy hours with men<br>
So fashioned if it might be &mdash; and his eyes<br>
Would pass again to those dead gods that grew<br>
In spreading evil round the temple walls;<br>
And, one dead pressure made, the carvers moved<br>
Along the wall to mould and mould again<br>
The self-same god, their chisels on the stone<br>
Tapping in dull precision as before,<br>
And he would turn, back to his lonely truth.<br><br>

He carved apace. And first his people's gods,<br>
About the toad, out of their sterile time,<br>
Under his hand thrilled and were recreate.<br>
The bull, the pard, the camel and the ram,<br>
Tiger and owl and bat &mdash; all were the signs<br>
Visibly made body on the stone<br>
Of sightless thought adventuring the host<br>
That is mere spirit; these the bloom achieved<br>
By secret labour in the flowing wood<br>
Of rain and air and wind and continent sun ...<br>
His tiger, lithe, immobile in the stone,<br>
A swift destruction for a moment leashed,<br>
Sprang crying from the jealous stealth of men<br>
Opposed in cunning watch, with engines hid<br>
Of torment and calamitous desire.<br>
His leopard, swift on lean and paltry limbs,<br>
Was fear in flight before accusing faith.<br>
His bull, with eyes that often in the dusk<br>
Would lift from the sweet meadow grass to watch<br>
Him homeward passing, bore on massy beam<br>
The burden of the patient of the earth.<br>
His camel bore the burden of the damned,<br>
Being gaunt, with eyes aslant along the nose.<br>
He had a friend, who hammered bronze and iron<br>
And cupped the moonstone on a silver ring,<br>
One constant like himself, would come at night<br>
Or bid him as a guest, when they would make<br>
Their poets touch a starrier height, or search<br>
Together with unparsimonious mind<br>
The crowded harbours of mortality.<br>
And there were jests, wholesome as harvest ale,<br>
Of homely habit, bred of hearts that dared<br>
Judgment of laughter under the eternal eye:<br>
This frolic wisdom was his carven owl.<br>
His ram was lordship on the lonely hills,<br>
Alert and fleet, content only to know<br>
The wind mightily pouring on his fleece,<br>
With yesterday and all unrisen suns<br>
Poorer than disinherited ghosts. His bat<br>
Was ancient envy made a mockery,<br>
Cowering below the newer eagle carved<br>
Above the arches with wide pinion spread,<br>
His faith's dominion of that happy dawn.<br><br>

And so he wrought the gods upon the wall,<br>
Living and crying out of his desire,<br>
Out of his patient incorruptible thought,<br>
Wrought them in joy was wages to his faith.<br>
And other than the gods he made. The stalks<br>
Of bluebells heavy with the news of spring,<br>
The vine loaded with plenty of the year,<br>
And swallows, merely tenderness of thought<br>
Bidding the stone to small and fragile flight;<br>
Leaves, the thin relics of autumnal boughs,<br>
Or massed in June ...<br>
All from their native pressure bloomed and sprang<br>
Under his shaping hand into a proud<br>
And governed image of the central man, &mdash; <br>
Their moulding, charts of all his travelling.<br>
And all were deftly ordered, duly set<br>
Between the windows, underneath the sills,<br>
And roofward, as a motion rightly planned,<br>
Till on the wall, out of the sullen stone,<br>
A glory blazed, his vision manifest,<br>
His wonder captive. And he was content.<br><br>

And when the builders and the carvers knew<br>
Their labours done, and high the temple stood<br>
Over the cornlands, king and counsellor<br>
And priest and chosen of the people came<br>
Among a ceremonial multitude<br>
To dedication. And, below the thrones<br>
Where king and archpriest ruled above the throng,<br>
Highest among the ranked artificers<br>
The carvers stood. And when, the temple vowed<br>
To holy use, tribute and choral praise<br>
Given as was ordained, the king looked down<br>
Upon the gathered folk, and bade them see<br>
The comely gods fashioned about the walls,<br>
And keep in honour men whose precious skill<br>
Could so adorn the sessions of their worship,<br>
Gravely the carvers bowed them to the ground.<br>
Only the man with wide and patient eyes<br>
Stood not among them; nor did any come<br>
To count his labour, where he watched alone<br>
Above the coloured throng. He heard, and looked<br>
Again upon his work, and knew it good,<br>
Smiled on his toad, passed down the stair unseen,<br>
And sang across the teeming meadows home.</blockquote><br>

<h3>The Old Ships</h3>

<blockquote>I have seen old ships sail like swans asleep<br>
Beyond the village which men still call Tyre,<br>
With leaden age o'ercargoed, dipping deep<br>
For Famagusta and the hidden sun<br>
That rings black Cyprus with a lake of fire;<br>
And all those ships were certainly so old &mdash; <br>
Who knows how oft with squat and noisy gun,<br>
Questing brown slaves or Syrian oranges,<br>
The pirate Genoese<br>
Hell-raked them till they rolled<br>
Blood, water, fruit and corpses up the hold.<br>
But now through friendly seas they softly run,<br>
Painted the mid-sea blue or shore-sea green,<br>
Still patterned with the vine and grapes in gold.<br><br>

But I have seen<br>
Pointing her shapely shadows from the dawn<br>
And image tumbled on a rose-swept bay<br>
A drowsy ship of some yet older day;<br>
And, wonder's breath indrawn,<br>
Thought I &mdash; who knows &mdash; who knows &mdash; but in that same<br>
(Fished up beyond Ææa, patched up new<br>
 &mdash; Stern painted brighter blue &mdash; )<br>
That talkative, bald-headed seaman came<br>
(Twelve patient comrades sweating at the oar)<br>
From Troy's doom-crimson shore,<br>
And with great lies about his wooden horse<br>
Set the crew laughing, and forgot his course.<br><br>

It was so old a ship &mdash; who knows, who knows?<br>
 &mdash; And yet so beautiful, I watched in vain<br>
To see the mast burst open with a rose,<br>
And the whole deck put on its leaves again.</blockquote><br>

Shouting that I have leapt the mountain bar,<br>
Down curve on curve my journey's white way gleams &mdash; <br>
My road along the river of return.<br><br>

I know the countries where the white moons burn,<br>
And heavy star on star<br>

The Triton's friendly or his fearful horn,<br>
And why the deep sea-bells but seldom chime,<br>
And how those waves and with what spell-swept rhyme<br>
In years of morning, on a summer's morn<br>
Whispering round his castle on the coast,<br>
Lured young Achilles from his haunted sleep<br>
And drave him out to dive beyond those deep<br>

All to embrace his mother thronèd in her shell.</blockquote><br>

I have too long been steering<br>
By the flashes in your eyes.<br>
Why drops the moonlight through my heart,<br>

Go the great engines of my boat<br>
As if their souls were free?'<br>
'Oh ask me not, bold sailor;<br>
Is not your ship a magic ship<br>

Are not these isles the Isles of Greece<br>

And give me answers three.<br>
What is your ship?" 'A British.'<br>
'And where may Britain be?'<br>

<blockquote>How splendid in the morning glows the lily: with what grace he throws<br>
His supplication to the rose: do roses nod the head, Yasmin?<br><br>

But when the silver dove descends I find the little flower of friends<br>
Whose very name that sweetly ends I say when I have said, Yasmin.<br><br>

The morning light is clear and cold: I dare not in that light behold<br>
A whiter light, a deeper gold, a glory too far shed, Yasmin.<br><br>

But when the deep red eye of day is level with the lone highway,<br>
And some to Mecca turn to pray, and I toward thy bed, Yasmin;<br><br>

Or when the wind beneath the moon is drifting like a soul aswoon,<br>
And harping planets talk love's tune with milky wings outspread, Yasmin,<br><br>

Shower down thy love, O burning bright! For one night or the other night<br>
Will come the Gardener in white, and gathered flowers are dead, Yasmin.</blockquote><br>

<a name="gatedam"></a><h3>The Gates of Damascus</h3>

<blockquote> Four great gates has the city of Damascus,<br>
    And four Grand Wardens, on their spears reclining,<br>
  All day long stand like tall stone men<br>
    And sleep on the towers when the moon is shining.<br><br>

    <i>This is the song of the East Gate Warden<br>
    When he locks the great gate and smokes in his garden</i>.<br><br>

Postern of Fate, the Desert Gate, Disaster's Cavern, Fort of Fear,<br>
The Portal of Bagdad am I, the Doorway of Diarbekir.<br><br>

The Persian dawn with new desires may net the flushing mountain spires,<br>
But my gaunt buttress still rejects the suppliance of those mellow fires.<br><br>

Pass not beneath, O Caravan, or pass not singing. Have you heard<br>
That silence where the birds are dead yet something pipeth like a bird?<br><br>

Pass not beneath! Men say there blows in stony deserts still a rose<br>
But with no scarlet to her leaf &mdash; and from whose heart no perfume flows.<br><br>

Wilt thou bloom red where she buds pale, thy sister rose? Wilt thou not fail<br>
When noonday flashes like a flail? Leave, nightingale, the Caravan!<br><br>

Pass then, pass all! Bagdad! ye cry, and down the billows of blue sky<br>
Ye beat the bell that beats to hell, and who shall thrust ye back? Not I.<br><br>

The Sun who flashes through the head and paints the shadows green and red &mdash; <br>
The Sun shall eat thy fleshless dead, O Caravan, O Caravan!<br><br>

And one who licks his lips for thirst with fevered eyes shall face in fear<br>
The palms that wave, the streams that burst, his last mirage, O Caravan!<br><br>

And one &mdash; the bird-voiced Singing-man &mdash; shall fall behind thee, Caravan!<br>
And God shall meet him in the night, and he shall sing as best he can.<br><br>

And one the Bedouin shall slay, and one, sand-stricken on the way,<br>
Go dark and blind; and one shall say &mdash; 'How lonely is the Caravan!'<br><br>

Pass out beneath, O Caravan, Doom's Caravan, Death's Caravan!<br>
I had not told ye, fools, so much, save that I heard your Singing-man.<br><br>

    <i>This was sung by the West Gate's keeper<br>
    When heaven's hollow dome grew deeper</i>.<br><br>

I am the gate toward the sea: O sailor men, pass out from me!<br>
I hear you high on Lebanon, singing the marvels of the sea.<br><br>

The dragon-green, the luminous, the dark, the serpent-haunted sea,<br>
The snow-besprinkled wine of earth, the white-and-blue-flower foaming sea.<br><br>

Beyond the sea are towns with towers, carved with lions and lily flowers,<br>
And not a soul in all those lonely streets to while away the hours.<br><br>

Beyond the towns, an isle where, bound, a naked giant bites the ground:<br>
The shadow of a monstrous wing looms on his back: and still no sound.<br><br>

Beyond the isle a rock that screams like madmen shouting in their dreams,<br>
From whose dark issues night and day blood crashes in a thousand streams.<br><br>

Beyond the rock is Restful Bay, where no wind breathes or ripple stirs,<br>
And there on Roman ships, they say, stand rows of metal mariners.<br><br>

Beyond the bay in utmost West old Solomon the Jewish King<br>
Sits with his beard upon his breast, and grips and guards his magic ring:<br><br>

And when that ring is stolen, he will rise in outraged majesty,<br>
And take the World upon his back, and fling the World beyond the sea.<br><br>

<i>This is the song of the North Gate's master,<br>
Who singeth fast, but drinketh faster.</i>         <br>
                                                      <br>
I am the gay Aleppo Gate: a dawn, a dawn and thou art there:<br>
Eat not thy heart with fear and care, O brother of the beast we hate!<br><br>

Thou hast not many miles to tread, nor other foes than fleas to dread;<br>
Homs shall behold thy morning meal, and Hama see thee safe in bed.<br><br>

Take to Aleppo filigrane, and take them paste of apricots,<br>
And coffee tables botched with pearl, and little beaten brassware pots:<br><br>

And thou shalt sell thy wares for thrice the Damascene retailers' price,<br>
And buy a fat Armenian slave who smelleth odorous and nice.<br><br>

Some men of noble stock were made: some glory in the murder-blade:<br>
Some praise a Science or an Art, but I like honourable Trade!<br><br>

Sell them the rotten, buy the ripe! Their heads are weak; their pockets burn.<br>
Aleppo men are mighty fools. Salaam Aleikum! Safe return!<br><br>

<i>This is the song of the South Gate Holder,<br>
A silver man, but his song is older.</i><br><br>

I am the Gate that fears no fall: the Mihrab of Damascus wall,<br>
The bridge of booming Sinai: the Arch of Allah all in all.<br><br>

O spiritual pilgrim, rise: the night has grown her single horn:<br>
The voices of the souls unborn are half adream with Paradise.<br><br>

To Meccah thou hast turned in prayer with aching heart and eyes that burn:<br>
Ah, Hajji, whither wilt thou turn when thou art there, when thou art there?<br><br>

God be thy guide from camp to camp: God be thy shade from well to well;<br>
God grant beneath the desert stars thou hear the  Prophet's camel bell.<br><br>

And God shall make thy body pure, and give thee knowledge to endure<br>
This ghost-life's piercing phantom-pain, and bring thee out to Life again.<br><br>

And God shall make thy soul a Glass where eighteen thousand Æons pass,<br>
And thou shalt see the gleaming Worlds as men see dew upon the grass.<br><br>

And son of Islam, it may be that thou shalt learn at journey's end<br>
Who walks thy garden eve on eve, and bows his head, and calls thee Friend.</blockquote>

Monks of Rome from their home where the blue seas break in foam,<br>

<br>
<h3>The Gorse</h3>

<blockquote>In dream, again within the clean, cold hell<br>
Of glazed and aching silence he was trapped;<br>
And, closing in, the blank walls of his cell<br>
Crushed stifling on him ... when the bracken snapped,<br>
Caught in his clutching fingers; and he lay<br>
Awake upon his back among the fern,<br>
With free eyes travelling the wide blue day,<br>
Unhindered, unremembering; while a burn<br>
Tinkled and gurgled somewhere out of sight,<br>
Unheard of him; till suddenly aware<br>
Of its cold music, shivering in the light,<br>
He raised himself, and with far-ranging stare<br>
Looked all about him: and with dazed eyes wide<br>
Saw, still as in a numb, unreal dream,<br>
Black figures scouring a far hill-side,<br>
With now and then a sunlit rifle's gleam;<br>
And knew the hunt was hot upon his track:<br>
Yet hardly seemed to mind, somehow, just then ...<br>
But kept on wondering why they looked so black<br>
On that hot hillside, all those little men<br>
Who scurried round like beetles &mdash; twelve, all told ...<br>
He counted them twice over; and began<br>
A third time reckoning them, but could not hold<br>
His starved wits to the business, while they ran<br>
So brokenly, and always stuck at 'five' ...<br>
And 'One, two, three, four, five,' a dozen times<br>
He muttered ... 'Can you catch a fish alive?'<br>
Sang mocking echoes of old nursery rhymes<br>
Through the strained, tingling hollow of his head.<br>
And now, almost remembering, he was stirred<br>
To pity them; and wondered if they'd fed<br>
Since he had, or if, ever since they'd heard<br>
Two nights ago the sudden signal-gun<br>
That raised alarm of his escape, they too<br>
Had fasted in the wilderness, and run<br>
With nothing but the thirsty wind to chew,<br>
And nothing in their bellies but a fill<br>
Of cold peat-water, till their heads were light ...<br><br>

The crackling of a rifle on the hill<br>
Rang in his ears: and stung to headlong flight,<br>
He started to his feet; and through the brake<br>
He plunged in panic, heedless of the sun<br>
That burned his cropped head to a red-hot ache<br>
Still racked with crackling echoes of the gun.<br><br>

Then suddenly the sun-enkindled fire<br>
Of gorse upon the moor-top caught his eye:<br>
And that gold glow held all his heart's desire,<br>
As, like a witless, flame-bewildered fly,<br>
He blundered towards the league-wide yellow blaze,<br>
And tumbled headlong on the spikes of bloom;<br>
And rising, bruised and bleeding and adaze,<br>
Struggled through clutching spines; the dense, sweet fume<br>
Of nutty, acrid scent like poison stealing<br>
Through his hot blood; the bristling yellow glare<br>
Spiking his eyes with fire, till he went reeling,<br>
Stifled and blinded, on &mdash; and did not care<br>
Though he were taken &mdash; wandering round and round,<br>
'Jerusalem the Golden' quavering shrill,<br>
Changing his tune to 'Tommy Tiddler's Ground':<br>
Till, just a lost child on that dazzling hill,<br>
Bewildered in a glittering golden maze<br>
Of stinging scented fire, he dropped, quite done,<br>
A shrivelling wisp within a world ablaze<br>
Beneath a blinding sky, one blaze of sun.</blockquote>

<br>
<i>Scene: The big tent-stable of a travelling circus. On the ground near
the entrance GENTLEMAN JOHN, stableman and general odd-job man, lies
smoking beside MERRY ANDREW, the clown. GENTLEMAN JOHN is a little
hunched man with a sensitive face and dreamy eyes. MERRY ANDREW, who is
resting between the afternoon and evening performances, with his clown's
hat lying beside him, wears a crimson wig, and a baggy suit of
orange-coloured cotton, patterned with purple cats. His face is chalked
dead-white, and painted with a set grin, so that it is impossible to see
what manner of man he is. In the back-ground are camels and elephants
feeding, dimly visible in the steamy dusk of the tent.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Gentleman John:</i>

<blockquote>And then consider camels: only think<br>
Of camels long enough, and you'ld go mad &mdash; <br>
With all their humps and lumps; their knobbly knees,<br>
Splay feet, and straddle legs; their sagging necks,<br>
Flat flanks, and scraggy tails, and monstrous teeth.<br>
I've not forgotten the first fiend I met:<br>
'Twas in a lane in Smyrna, just a ditch<br>
Between the shuttered houses, and so narrow<br>
The brute's bulk blocked the road; the huge green stack<br>
Of dewy fodder that it slouched beneath<br>
Brushing the yellow walls on either hand,<br>
And shutting out the strip of burning blue:<br>
And I'd to face that vicious bobbing head<br>
With evil eyes, slack lips, and nightmare teeth,<br>
And duck beneath the snaky, squirming neck,<br>
Pranked with its silly string of bright blue beads,<br>
That seemed to wriggle every way at once,<br>
As though it were a hydra. Allah's beard!<br>
But I was scared, and nearly turned and ran:<br>
I felt that muzzle take me by the scruff,<br>
And heard those murderous teeth crunching my spine,<br>
Before I stooped &mdash; though I dodged safely under.<br>
I've always been afraid of ugliness.<br>
I'm such a toad myself, I hate all toads;<br>
And the camel is the ugliest toad of all,<br>
To my mind; and it's just my devil's luck<br>
I've come to this &mdash; to be a camel's lackey,<br>
To fetch and carry for original sin,<br>
For sure enough, the camel's old evil incarnate.<br>
Blue beads and amulets to ward off evil!<br>
No eye's more evil than a camel's eye.<br>
The elephant is quite a comely brute,<br>
Compared with Satan camel, &mdash; trunk and all,<br>
His floppy ears, and his inconsequent tail.<br>
He's stolid, but at least a gentleman.<br>
It doesn't hurt my pride to valet him,<br>
And bring his shaving-water. He's a lord.<br>
Only the bluest blood that has come down<br>
Through generations from the mastodon<br>
Could carry off that tail with dignity,<br>
That tail and trunk. He cannot look absurd,<br>
For all the monkey tricks you put him through,<br>
Your paper hoops and popguns. He just makes<br>
His masters look ridiculous, when his pomp's<br>
Butchered to make a bumpkin's holiday.<br>
He's dignity itself, and proper pride,<br>
That stands serenely in a circus-world<br>
Of mountebanks and monkeys. He has weight<br>
Behind him: æons of primeval power<br>
Have shaped that pillared bulk; and he stands sure,<br>
Solid, substantial on the world's foundations.<br>
And he has form, form that's too big a thing<br>
To be called beauty. Once, long since, I thought<br>
To be a poet, and shape words, and mould<br>
A poem like an elephant, huge, sublime,<br>
To front oblivion; and because I failed,<br>
And all my rhymes were gawky, shambling camels,<br>
Or else obscene, blue-buttocked apes, I'm doomed<br>
To lackey it for things such as I've made,<br>
Till one of them crunches my backbone with his teeth,<br>
Or knocks my wind out with a forthright kick<br>
Clean in the midriff, crumpling up in death<br>
The hunched and stunted body that was me &mdash; <br>
John, the apostle of the Perfect Form!<br>
Jerusalem! I'm talking like a book &mdash; <br>
As you would say: and a bad book at that,<br>
A maundering, kiss-mammy book &mdash; The Hunch-back's End<br>
Or The Camel-Keeper's Reward &mdash; would be its title.<br>
I froth and bubble like a new-broached cask.<br>
No wonder you look glum, for all your grin.<br>
What makes you mope? You've naught to growse about.<br>
You've got no hump. Your body's brave and straight &mdash; <br>
So shapely even that you can afford<br>
To trick it in fantastic shapelessness,<br>
Knowing that there's a clean-limbed man beneath<br>
Preposterous pantaloons and purple cats.<br>
I would have been a poet, if I could:<br>
But better than shaping poems 'twould have been<br>
To have had a comely body and clean limbs<br>
Obedient to my bidding.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merry Andrew:</i>

<blockquote>I missed a hoop<br>
This afternoon.</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

<blockquote>You missed a hoop? You mean ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Merry Andrew:</i>

<blockquote>That I am done, used up, scrapped, on the shelf,<br>
Out of the running &mdash; only that, no more.</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

<blockquote>Well, I've been missing hoops my whole life long;<br>
Though, when I come to think of it, perhaps<br>
There's little consolation to be chewed<br>
From crumbs that I can offer.</blockquote><br>


<i>Merry Andrew:</i>

<blockquote>       I've not missed<br>
A hoop since I was six. I'm forty-two.<br>
This is the first time that my body's failed me:<br>
But 'twill not be the last. And ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

<blockquote>       Such is life!<br>
You're going to say. You see I've got it pat,<br>
Your jaded wheeze. Lord, what a wit I'ld make<br>
If I'd a set grin painted on my face.<br>
And such is life, I'ld say a hundred times,<br>
And each time set the world aroar afresh<br>
At my original humour. Missed a hoop!<br>
Why, man alive, you've naught to grumble at.<br>
I've boggled every hoop since I was six.<br>
I'm fifty-five; and I've run round a ring<br>
Would make this potty circus seem a pinhole.<br>
I wasn't born to sawdust. I'd the world<br>
For circus ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Merry Andrew:</i>

<blockquote> It's no time for crowing now.<br>
I know a gentleman, and take on trust<br>
The silver spoon and all. My teeth were cut<br>
Upon a horseshoe: and I wasn't born<br>
To purple and fine linen &mdash; but to sawdust,<br>
To sawdust, as you say &mdash; brought up on sawdust.<br>
I've had to make my daily bread of sawdust:<br>
Ay, and my children's, &mdash; children's, that's the rub,<br>
As Shakespeare says ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

<blockquote>    Ah, there you go again!<br>
What a rare wit to set the ring aroar &mdash; <br>
As Shakespeare says! Crowing? A gentleman?<br>
Man, didn't you say you'd never missed a hoop?<br>
It's only gentlemen who miss no hoops,<br>
Clean livers, easy lords of life who take<br>
Each obstacle at a leap, who never fail.<br>
You are the gentleman.</blockquote><br>


<i>Merry Andrew:</i>

<blockquote>     Now don't you try<br>
Being funny at my expense; or you'll soon find<br>
I'm not quite done for yet &mdash; not quite snuffed out.<br>
There's still a spark of life. You may have words:<br>
But I've a fist will be a match for them.<br>
Words slaver feebly from a broken jaw.<br>
I've always lived straight, as a man must do<br>
In my profession, if he'ld keep in fettle:<br>
But I'm no gentleman, for I fail to see<br>
There's any sport in baiting a poor man<br>
Because he's losing grip at forty-two,<br>
And sees his livelihood slipping from his grasp &mdash; <br>
Ay, and his children's bread.</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

 <blockquote>     Why, man alive,<br>
Who's baiting you? This winded, broken cur,<br>
That limps through life, to bait a bull like you!<br>
You don't want pity, man! The beaten bull,<br>
Even when the dogs are tearing at his gullet,<br>
Turns no eye up for pity. I myself,<br>
Crippled and hunched and twisted as I am,<br>
Would make a brave fend to stand up to you<br>
Until you swallowed your words, if you should slobber<br>
Your pity over me. A bull! Nay, man,<br>
You're nothing but a bear with a sore head.<br>
A bee has stung you &mdash; you who've lived on honey.<br>
Sawdust, forsooth! You've had the sweet of life:<br>
You've munched the honeycomb till &mdash; </blockquote><br>



<i>Merry Andrew:</i>

<blockquote>             Ay! talk's cheap.<br>
But you've no children. You don't understand.
</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

<blockquote>I have no children: I don't understand!</blockquote><br>


<i>Merry Andrew:</i>

<blockquote>It's children make the difference.</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

       <blockquote> Man alive &mdash; <br>
Alive and kicking, though you're shamming dead &mdash; <br>
You've hit the truth at last. It's that, just that,<br>
Makes all the difference. If you hadn't children,<br>
I'ld find it in my heart to pity you,<br>
Granted you'ld let me. I don't understand!<br>
I've seen you stripped. I've seen your children stripped.<br>
You've never seen me naked; but you can guess<br>
The misstitched, gnarled, and crooked thing I am.<br>
Now, do you understand? I may have words.<br>
But you, man, do you never burn with pride   <br>
That you've begotten those six limber bodies,  <br>
Firm flesh, and supple sinew, and lithe limb &mdash;  <br>
Six nimble lads, each like young Absalom,<br>
With red blood running lively in his veins,<br>
Bone of your bone, your very flesh and blood?<br>
It's you don't understand. God, what I'ld give<br>
This moment to be you, just as you are,<br>
Preposterous pantaloons, and purple cats,<br>
And painted leer, and crimson curls, and all &mdash; <br>
To be you now, with only one missed hoop,<br>
If I'd six clean-limbed children of my loins,<br>
Born of the ecstasy of life within me,<br>
To keep it quick and valiant in the ring<br>
When I ... but I ... Man, man, you've missed a hoop;<br>
But they'll take every hoop like blooded colts:<br>
And 'twill be you in them that leaps through life,<br>
And in their children, and their children's children.<br>
God! doesn't it make you hold your breath to think<br>
There'll always be an Andrew in the ring,<br>
The very spit and image of you stripped,<br>
While life's old circus lasts? And I ... at least<br>
There is no twisted thing of my begetting<br>
To keep my shame alive: and that's the most<br>
That I've to pride myself upon. But, God,<br>
I'm proud, ay, proud as Lucifer, of that.<br>
Think what it means, with all the urge and sting,<br>
When such a lust of life runs in the veins.<br>
You, with your six sons, and your one missed hoop,<br>
Put that thought in your pipe and smoke it. Well,<br>
And how d'you like the flavour? Something bitter?<br>
And burns the tongue a trifle? That's the brand<br>
That I must smoke while I've the breath to puff.<br>
                                      <i>(Pause.)</i><br>
I've always worshipped the body, all my life &mdash; <br>
The body, quick with the perfect health which is beauty,<br>
Lively, lissom, alert, and taking its way<br>
Through the world with the easy gait of the early gods.<br>
The only moments I've lived my life to the full<br>
And that live again in remembrance unfaded are those<br>
When I've seen life compact in some perfect body,<br>
The living God made manifest in man:<br>
A diver in the Mediterranean, resting,<br>
With sleeked black hair, and glistening salt-tanned skin,<br>
Gripping the quivering gunwale with tense hands,<br>
His torso lifted out of the peacock sea,<br>
Like Neptune, carved in amber, come to life:<br>
A stark Egyptian on the Nile's edge poised<br>
Like a bronze Osiris against the lush, rank green:<br>
A fisherman dancing reels, on New Year's Eve,<br>
In a hall of shadowy rafters and flickering lights,<br>
At St Abbs on the Berwickshire coast, to the skirl of the pipes,<br>
The lift of the wave in his heels, the sea in his veins:<br>
A Cherokee Indian, as though he were one with his horse,<br>
His coppery shoulders agleam, his feathers aflame<br>
With the last of the sun, descending a gulch in Alaska;<br>
A brawny Cleveland puddler, stripped to the loins,<br>
On the cauldron's brink, stirring the molten iron<br>
In the white-hot glow, a man of white-hot metal:<br>
A Cornish ploughboy driving an easy share<br>
Through the grey, light soil of a headland, against a sea<br>
Of sapphire, gay in his new white corduroys,<br>
Blue-eyed, dark-haired, and whistling a careless tune:<br>
Jack Johnson, stripped for the ring, in his swarthy pride<br>
Of sleek and rippling muscle ...</blockquote>

<i>Merry Andrew:</i>

<blockquote>            Jack's the boy!<br>
Ay, he's the proper figure of a man.<br>
But he'll grow fat and flabby and scant of breath.<br>
He'll miss his hoop some day.</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

 <blockquote>       But what are words<br>
To shape the joy of form? The Greeks did best<br>
To cut in marble or to cast in bronze<br>
Their ecstasy of living. I remember<br>
A marvellous Hermes that I saw in Athens,<br>
Fished from the very bottom of the deep<br>
Where he had lain two thousand years or more,<br>
Wrecked with a galleyful of Roman pirates,<br>
Among the white bones of his plunderers<br>
Whose flesh had fed the fishes as they sank &mdash; <br>
Serene in cold, imperishable beauty,<br>
Biding his time, till he should rise again,<br>
Exultant from the wave, for all men's worship,<br>
The morning-spring of life, the youth of the world,<br>
Shaped in sea-coloured bronze for everlasting.<br>
Ay, the Greeks knew: but men have forgotten now.<br>
Not easily do we meet beauty walking<br>
The world to-day in all the body's pride.<br>
That's why I'm here &mdash; a stable-boy to camels &mdash; <br>
For in the circus-ring there's more delight<br>
Of seemly bodies, goodly in sheer health,<br>
Bodies trained and tuned to the perfect pitch,<br>
Eager, blithe, debonair, from head to heel<br>
Aglow and alive in every pulse, than elsewhere<br>
In this machine-ridden land of grimy, glum<br>
Round-shouldered, coughing mechanics. Once I lived<br>
In London, in a slum called Paradise,<br>
Sickened to see the greasy pavements crawling<br>
With puny flabby babies, thick as maggots.<br>
Poor brats! I'ld soon go mad if I'd to live<br>
In London, with its stunted men and women<br>
But little better to look on than myself.<br>
Yet, there's an island where the men keep fit &mdash; <br>
St Kilda's, a stark fastness of high crag:<br>
They must keep fit or famish: their main food<br>
The Solan goose; and it's a chancy job<br>
To swing down a sheer face of slippery granite<br>
And drop a noose over the sentinel bird<br>
Ere he can squawk to rouse the sleeping flock.<br>
They must keep fit &mdash; their bodies taut and trim &mdash; <br>
To have the nerve: and they're like tempered steel,<br>
Suppled and fined. But even they've grown slacker<br>
Through traffic with the mainland, in these days.<br>
A hundred years ago, the custom held<br>
That none should take a wife till he had stood,<br>
His left heel on the dizziest point of crag,<br>
His right leg and both arms stretched in mid air,<br>
Above the sea: three hundred feet to drop<br>
To death, if he should fail &mdash; a Spartan test.<br>
But any man who could have failed, would scarce<br>
Have earned his livelihood or his children's bread<br>
On that bleak rock.</blockquote><br>


<i>Merry Andrew (drowsily):</i>

<blockquote>Ay, children &mdash; that's it, children!</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

<blockquote>St Kilda's children had a chance, at least,<br>
With none begotten idly of weakling fathers.<br>
A Spartan test for fatherhood! Should they miss<br>
Their hoop, 'twas death, and childless. You have still<br>
Six lives to take unending hoops for you,<br>
And you yourself are not done yet ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Merry Andrew (more drowsily):</i>

<blockquote>    Not yet.<br>
And there's much comfort in the thought of children.<br>
They're bonnie boys enough; and should do well,<br>
If I can but keep going a little while,<br>
A little longer till ...</blockquote><br>


<i>Gentleman John:</i>

<blockquote>Six strapping sons!<br>
And I have naught but camels.<br>
                            <i>(Pause.)</i><br>
                              Yet, I've seen<br>
A vision in this stable that puts to shame<br>
Each ecstasy of mortal flesh and blood<br>
That's been my eyes' delight. I never breathed<br>
A word of it to man or woman yet:<br>
I couldn't whisper it now to you, if you looked<br>
Like any human thing this side of death.<br>
'Twas on the night I stumbled on the circus.<br>
I'd wandered all day, lost among the fells,<br>
Over snow-smothered hills, through blinding blizzard,<br>
Whipped by a wind that seemed to strip and skin me,<br>
Till I was one numb ache of sodden ice.<br>
Quite done, and drunk with cold, I'ld soon have dropped<br>
Dead in a ditch; when suddenly a lantern<br>
Dazzled my eyes. I smelt a queer warm smell;<br>
And felt a hot puff in my face; and blundered<br>
Out of the flurry of snow and raking wind<br>
Dizzily into a glowing Arabian night<br>
Of elephants and camels having supper.<br>
I thought that I'd gone mad, stark, staring mad;<br>
But I was much too sleepy to mind just then &mdash; <br>
Dropped dead asleep upon a truss of hay;<br>
And lay, a log, till &mdash; well, I cannot tell<br>
How long I lay unconscious. I but know<br>
I slept, and wakened, and that 'twas no dream.<br>
I heard a rustle in the hay beside me,<br>
And opening sleepy eyes, scarce marvelling,<br>
I saw her, standing naked in the lamplight,<br>
Beneath the huge tent's cavernous canopy,<br>
Against the throng of elephants and camels<br>
That champed unwondering in the golden dusk,<br>
Moon-white Diana, mettled Artemis &mdash; <br>
Her body, quick and tense as her own bowstring,<br>
Her spirit, an arrow barbed and strung for flight &mdash; <br>
White snowflakes melting on her night-black hair,<br>
And on her glistening breasts and supple thighs:<br>
Her red lips parted, her keen eyes alive<br>
With fierce, far-ranging hungers of the chase<br>
Over the hills of morn &mdash; The lantern guttered<br>
And I was left alone in the outer darkness<br>
Among the champing elephants and camels.<br>
And I'll be a camel-keeper to the end:<br>
Though never again my eyes...<br>
                             <i>(Pause.)</i><br>
                               So you can sleep,<br>
You Merry Andrew, for all you missed your hoop.<br>
It's just as well, perhaps. Now I can hold<br>
My secret to the end. Ah, here they come!</blockquote><br>

<i>Six lads, between the ages of three and twelve, clad in pink tights
covered with silver spangles, tumble into the tent.</i><br>

Of the crimson curls, and tug, and you will hear<br>
The purple pussies all caterwaul at once.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="bull">Ralph Hodgson</a></h2>
<br>
<h3>The Bull</h3>

<blockquote>See an old unhappy bull,<br>
Sick in soul and body both,<br>
Slouching in the undergrowth<br>
Of the forest beautiful,<br>
Banished from the herd he led,<br>
Bulls and cows a thousand head.<br><br>

Cranes and gaudy parrots go<br>
Up and down the burning sky;<br>
Tree-top cats purr drowsily<br>
In the dim-day green below;<br>
And troops of monkeys, nutting, some,<br>
All disputing, go and come;<br><br>

And things abominable sit<br>
Picking offal buck or swine,<br>
On the mess and over it<br>
Burnished flies and beetles shine,<br>
And spiders big as bladders lie<br>
Under hemlocks ten foot high;<br><br>

And a dotted serpent curled<br>
Round and round and round a tree,<br>
Yellowing its greenery,<br>
Keeps a watch on all the world,<br>
All the world and this old bull<br>
In the forest beautiful.<br><br>

Bravely by his fall he came:<br>
One he led, a bull of blood<br>
Newly come to lustihood,<br>
Fought and put his prince to shame,<br>
Snuffed and pawed the prostrate head<br>
Tameless even while it bled.<br><br>

There they left him, every one,<br>
Left him there without a lick,<br>
Left him for the birds to pick,<br>
Left him there for carrion,<br>
Vilely from their bosom cast<br>
Wisdom, worth and love at last.<br><br>

When the lion left his lair<br>
And roared his beauty through the hills,<br>
And the vultures pecked their quills<br>
And flew into the middle air,<br>
Then this prince no more to reign<br>
Came to life and lived again.<br><br>

He snuffed the herd in far retreat,<br>
He saw the blood upon the ground,<br>
And snuffed the burning airs around<br>
Still with beevish odours sweet,<br>
While the blood ran down his head<br>
And his mouth ran slaver red.<br><br>

Pity him, this fallen chief,<br>
All his splendour, all his strength,<br>
All his body's breadth and length<br>
Dwindled down with shame and grief,<br>
Half the bull he was before,<br>
Bones and leather, nothing more.<br><br>

See him standing dewlap-deep<br>
In the rushes at the lake,<br>
Surly, stupid, half asleep,<br>
Waiting for his heart to break<br>
And the birds to join the flies<br>
Feasting at his bloodshot eyes, &mdash; <br><br>

Standing with his head hung down<br>
In a stupor, dreaming things:<br>
Green savannas, jungles brown,<br>
Battlefields and bellowings,<br>
Bulls undone and lions dead<br>
And vultures flapping overhead.<br><br>

Dreaming things: of days he spent<br>
With his mother gaunt and lean<br>
In the valley warm and green,<br>
Full of baby wonderment,<br>
Blinking out of silly eyes<br>
At a hundred mysteries;<br><br>

Dreaming over once again<br>
How he wandered with a throng<br>
Of bulls and cows a thousand strong,<br>
Wandered on from plain to plain,<br>
Up the hill and down the dale,<br>
Always at his mother's tail;<br><br>

How he lagged behind the herd,<br>
Lagged and tottered, weak of limb,<br>
And she turned and ran to him<br>
Blaring at the loathly bird<br>
Stationed always in the skies,<br>
Waiting for the flesh that dies.<br><br>

Dreaming maybe of a day<br>
When her drained and drying paps<br>
Turned him to the sweets and saps,<br>
Richer fountains by the way,<br>
And she left the bull she bore<br>
And he looked to her no more;<br><br>

And his little frame grew stout,<br>
And his little legs grew strong,<br>
And the way was not so long;<br>
And his little horns came out,<br>
And he played at butting trees<br>
And boulder-stones and tortoises,<br><br>

Joined a game of knobby skulls<br>
With the youngsters of his year,<br>
All the other little bulls,<br>
Learning both to bruise and bear,<br>
Learning how to stand a shock<br>
Like a little bull of rock.<br><br>

Dreaming of a day less dim,<br>
Dreaming of a time less far,<br>
When the faint but certain star<br>
Of destiny burned clear for him,<br>
And a fierce and wild unrest<br>
Broke the quiet of his breast,<br><br>

And the gristles of his youth<br>
Hardened in his comely pow,<br>
And he came to fighting growth,<br>
Beat his bull and won his cow,<br>
And flew his tail and trampled off<br>
Past the tallest, vain enough,<br><br>

And curved about in splendour full<br>
And curved again and snuffed the airs<br>
As who should say Come out who dares!<br>
And all beheld a bull, a Bull,<br>
And knew that here was surely one<br>
That backed for no bull, fearing none.<br><br>

And the leader of the herd<br>
Looked and saw, and beat the ground,<br>
And shook the forest with his sound,<br>
Bellowed at the loathly bird<br>
Stationed always in the skies,<br>
Waiting for the flesh that dies.<br><br>

Dreaming, this old bull forlorn,<br>
Surely dreaming of the hour<br>
When he came to sultan power,<br>
And they owned him master-horn,<br>
Chiefest bull of all among<br>
Bulls and cows a thousand strong.<br><br>

And in all the tramping herd<br>
Not a bull that barred his way,<br>
Not a cow that said him nay,<br>
Not a bull or cow that erred<br>
In the furnace of his look<br>
Dared a second, worse rebuke;<br><br>

Not in all the forest wide,<br>
Jungle, thicket, pasture, fen,<br>
Not another dared him then,<br>
Dared him and again defied;<br>
Not a sovereign buck or boar<br>
Came a second time for more.<br><br>

Not a serpent that survived<br>
Once the terrors of his hoof<br>
Risked a second time reproof,<br>
Came a second time and lived,<br>
Not a serpent in its skin<br>
Came again for discipline;<br><br>

Not a leopard bright as flame,<br>
Flashing fingerhooks of steel,<br>
That a wooden tree might feel,<br>
Met his fury once and came<br>
For a second reprimand,<br>
Not a leopard in the land.<br><br>

Not a lion of them all,<br>
Not a lion of the hills,<br>
Hero of a thousand kills,<br>
Dared a second fight and fall,<br>
Dared that ram terrific twice,<br>
Paid a second time the price ...<br><br>

Pity him, this dupe of dream,<br>
Leader of the herd again<br>
Only in his daft old brain,<br>
Once again the bull supreme<br>
And bull enough to bear the part<br>
Only in his tameless heart.<br><br>

Pity him that he must wake;<br>
Even now the swarm of flies<br>
Blackening his bloodshot eyes<br>
Bursts and blusters round the lake,<br>
Scattered from the feast half-fed,<br>
By great shadows overhead.<br><br>

And the dreamer turns away<br>
From his visionary herds<br>
And his splendid yesterday,<br>
Turns to meet the loathly birds<br>
Flocking round him from the skies,<br>
Waiting for the flesh that dies.</blockquote><br>

<a name="songhon"></a><h3>Song of Honour</h3>

<blockquote>I climbed a hill as light fell short,<br>
And rooks came home in scramble sort,<br>
And filled the trees and flapped and fought<br>
And sang themselves to sleep;<br>
An owl from nowhere with no sound<br>
Swung by and soon was nowhere found,<br>
I heard him calling half-way round,<br>
Holloing loud and deep;<br>
A pair of stars, faint pins of light,<br>
Then many a star, sailed into sight,<br>
And all the stars, the flower of night,<br>
Were round me at a leap;<br>
To tell how still the valleys lay<br>
I heard a watchdog miles away ...<br>
And bells of distant sheep.<br><br>

I heard no more of bird or bell,<br>
The mastiff in a slumber fell,<br>
I stared into the sky,<br>
As wondering men have always done<br>
Since beauty and the stars were one,<br>
Though none so hard as I.<br><br>

It seemed, so still the valleys were,<br>
As if the whole world knelt at prayer,<br>
Save me and me alone;<br>
So pure and wide that silence was<br>
I feared to bend a blade of grass,<br>
And there I stood like stone.<br><br>

There, sharp and sudden, there I heard &mdash; <br>
<i>Ah! some wild lovesick singing bird<br>
Woke singing in the trees?</i><br>
<i>The nightingale and babble-wren<br>
Were in the English greenwood then,<br>
And you heard one of these?</i><br><br>

The babble-wren and nightingale<br>
Sang in the Abyssinian vale<br>
That season of the year!<br>
Yet, true enough, I heard them plain,<br>
I heard them both again, again,<br>
As sharp and sweet and clear<br>
As if the Abyssinian tree<br>
Had thrust a bough across the sea,<br>
Had thrust a bough across to me<br>
With music for my ear!<br><br>

I heard them both, and oh! I heard<br>
The song of every singing bird<br>
That sings beneath the sky,<br>
And with the song of lark and wren<br>
The song of mountains, moths and men<br>
And seas and rainbows vie!<br><br>

I heard the universal choir<br>
The Sons of Light exalt their Sire<br>
With universal song,<br>
Earth's lowliest and loudest notes,<br>
Her million times ten million throats<br>
Exalt Him loud and long,<br>
And lips and lungs and tongues of Grace<br>
From every part and every place<br>
Within the shining of His face,<br>
The universal throng.<br><br>

I heard the hymn of being sound<br>
From every well of honour found <br>
In human sense and soul: <br>
The song of poets when they write<br>
The testament of Beautysprite<br>
Upon a flying scroll,<br>
The song of painters when they take<br>
A burning brush for Beauty's sake<br>
And limn her features whole &mdash; <br><br>

The song of men divinely wise<br>
Who look and see in starry skies<br>
Not stars so much as robins' eyes,<br>
And when these pale away<br>
Hear flocks of shiny pleiades<br>
Among the plums and apple trees<br>
Sing in the summer day &mdash; <br>
The song of all both high and low<br>
To some blest vision true,<br>
The song of beggars when they throw<br>
The crust of pity all men owe<br>
To hungry sparrows in the snow,<br>
Old beggars hungry too &mdash; <br>
The song of kings of kingdoms when<br>
They rise above their fortune men,<br>
And crown themselves anew, &mdash; <br><br>

The song of courage, heart and will<br>
And gladness in a fight,<br>
Of men who face a hopeless hill<br>
With sparking and delight,<br>
The bells and bells of song that ring<br>
Round banners of a cause or king<br>
From armies bleeding white &mdash; <br><br>

The song of sailors every one<br>
When monstrous tide and tempest run<br>
At ships like bulls at red,<br>
When stately ships are twirled and spun<br>
Like whipping tops and help there's none<br>
And mighty ships ten thousand ton<br>
Go down like lumps of lead &mdash; <br><br>

And song of fighters stern as they<br>
At odds with fortune night and day,<br>
Crammed up in cities grim and grey<br>
As thick as bees in hives,<br>
Hosannas of a lowly throng<br>
Who sing unconscious of their song,<br>
Whose lips are in their lives &mdash; <br><br>

And song of some at holy war<br>
With spells and ghouls more dread by far<br>
Than deadly seas and cities are,<br>
Or hordes of quarrelling kings &mdash; -<br>
The song of fighters great and small,<br>
The song of pretty fighters all,<br>
And high heroic things &mdash; <br><br>

The song of lovers &mdash; who knows how<br>
Twitched up from place and time<br>
Upon a sigh, a blush, a vow,<br>
A curve or hue of cheek or brow,<br>
Borne up and off from here and now<br>
Into the void sublime!<br><br>

And crying loves and passions still<br>
In every key from soft to shrill<br>
And numbers never done,<br>
Dog-loyalties to faith and friend,<br>
And loves like Ruth's of old no end,<br>
And intermission none &mdash; <br>
And burst on burst for beauty and<br>
For numbers not behind,<br>
From men whose love of motherland<br>
Is like a dog's for one dear hand,<br>
Sole, selfless, boundless, blind &mdash; <br>
And song of some with hearts beside<br>
For men and sorrows far and wide,<br>
Who watch the world with pity and pride<br>
And warm to all mankind &mdash; <br><br>

And endless joyous music rise<br>
From children at their play,<br>
And endless soaring lullabies<br>
From happy, happy mothers' eyes,<br>
And answering crows and baby cries,<br>
How many who shall say!<br>
And many a song as wondrous well<br>
With pangs and sweets intolerable<br>
From lonely hearths too gray to tell,<br>
God knows how utter gray!<br>
And song from many a house of care<br>
When pain has forced a footing there<br>
And there's a Darkness on the stair<br>
Will not be turned away &mdash; <br><br>

And song &mdash; that song whose singers come<br>
With old kind tales of pity from<br>
The Great Compassion's lips,<br>
That makes the bells of Heaven to peal<br>
Round pillows frosty with the feel<br>
Of Death's cold finger tips &mdash; <br><br>

The song of men all sorts and kinds,<br>
As many tempers, moods and minds<br>
As leaves are on a tree,<br>
As many faiths and castes and creeds,<br>
As many human bloods and breeds<br>
As in the world may be;<br><br>

The song of each and all who gaze<br>
On Beauty in her naked blaze,<br>
Or see her dimly in a haze,<br>
Or get her light in fitful rays<br>
And tiniest needles even,<br>
The song of all not wholly dark,<br>
Not wholly sunk in stupor stark<br>
Too deep for groping Heaven &mdash; <br><br>

And alleluias sweet and clear<br>
And wild with beauty men mishear,<br>
From choirs of song as near and dear<br>
To Paradise as they,<br>
The everlasting pipe and flute<br>
Of wind and sea and bird and brute,<br>
And lips deaf men imagine mute<br>
In wood and stone and clay;<br><br>

The music of a lion strong<br>
That shakes a hill a whole night long,<br>
A hill as loud as he,<br>
The twitter of a mouse among<br>
Melodious greenery,<br>
The ruby's and the rainbow's song,<br>
The nightingale's &mdash; all three,<br>
The song of life that wells and flows<br>
From every leopard, lark and rose<br>
And everything that gleams or goes<br>
Lack-lustre in the sea.<br><br>

I heard it all, each, every note<br>
Of every lung and tongue and throat,<br>
Ay, every rhythm and rhyme<br>
Of everything that lives and loves<br>
And upward, ever upward moves<br>
From lowly to sublime!<br>
Earth's multitudinous Sons of Light,<br>
I heard them lift their lyric might<br>
With each and every chanting sprite<br>
That lit the sky that wondrous night<br>
As far as eye could climb!<br><br>

I heard it all, I heard the whole<br>
Harmonious hymn of being roll<br>
Up through the chapel of my soul<br>
And at the altar die,<br>
And in the awful quiet then<br>
Myself I heard, Amen, Amen,<br>
Amen I heard me cry!<br>
I heard it all, and then although<br>
I caught my flying senses, oh,<br>
A dizzy man was I!<br>
I stood and stared; the sky was lit,<br>
The sky was stars all over it,<br>
I stood, I knew not why,<br>
Without a wish, without a will,<br>
I stood upon that silent hill<br>
And stared into the sky until<br>
My eyes were blind with stars and still<br>
I stared into the sky.</blockquote>

<h3>Service of All the Dead</h3>

<blockquote>Between the avenues of cypresses,<br>
All in their scarlet cloaks, and surplices<br>
Of linen, go the chaunting choristers,<br>
The priests in gold and black, the villagers.<br><br>

And all along the path to the cemetery<br>
The round, dark heads of men crowd silently,<br>
And black-scarved faces of women-folk, wistfully<br>
Watch at the banner of death, and the mystery.<br><br>

And at the foot of a grave a father stands<br>
With sunken head, and forgotten, folded hands;<br>
And at the foot of a grave a woman kneels<br>
With pale shut face, and neither hears nor feels<br><br>

The coming of the chaunting choristers<br>
Between the avenues of cypresses,<br>
The silence of the many villagers,<br>
The candle-flames beside the surplices.</blockquote><br>

<a name="meetmt"></a><h3>Meeting Among the Mountains</h3>

<blockquote>The little pansies by the road have turned<br>
Away their purple faces and their gold,<br>
And evening has taken all the bees from the thyme,<br>
And all the scent is shed away by the cold.<br><br>

Against the hard and pale blue evening sky<br>
The mountain's new-dropped summer snow is clear<br>
Glistening in steadfast stillness: like transcendent<br>
Clean pain sending on us a chill down here.<br><br>

Christ on the Cross! &mdash; his beautiful young man's body<br>
Has fallen dead upon the nails, and hangs<br>
White and loose at last, with all the pain<br>
Drawn on his mouth, eyes broken at last by his pangs.<br><br>

And slowly down the mountain road, belated,<br>
A bullock wagon comes; so I am ashamed<br>
To gaze any more at the Christ, whom the mountain snows<br>
Whitely confront; I wait on the grass, am lamed.<br><br>

The breath of the bullock stains the hard, chill air,<br>
The band is across its brow, and it scarcely seems<br>
To draw the load, so still and slow it moves,<br>
While the driver on the shaft sits crouched in dreams.<br><br>

Surely about his sunburnt face is something<br>
That vexes me with wonder. He sits so still<br>
Here among all this silence, crouching forward,<br>
Dreaming and letting the bullock take its will.<br><br>

I stand aside on the grass to let them go;<br>
 &mdash; And Christ, I have met his accusing eyes again,<br>
The brown eyes black with misery and hate, that look <br>
Full in my own, and the torment starts again.<br><br>

One moment the hate leaps at me standing there,<br>
One moment I see the stillness of agony,<br>
Something frozen in the silence that dare not be<br>
Loosed, one moment the darkness frightens me.<br><br>

Then among the averted pansies, beneath the high<br>
White peaks of snow, at the foot of the sunken Christ<br>
I stand in a chill of anguish, trying to say<br>
The joy I bought was not too highly priced.<br><br>

But he has gone, motionless, hating me,<br>
Living as the mountains do, because they are strong,<br>
With a pale, dead Christ on the crucifix of his heart,<br>
And breathing the frozen memory of his wrong.<br><br>

Still in his nostrils the frozen breath of despair,<br>
And heart like a cross that bears dead agony<br>
Of naked love, clenched in his fists the shame,<br>
And in his belly the smouldering hate of me.<br><br>

And I, as I stand in the cold, averted flowers,<br>
Feel the shame-wounds in his hands pierce through my own,<br>
And breathe despair that turns my lungs to stone<br>
And know the dead Christ weighing on my bone.</blockquote><br>

<a name="cruelv"></a><h3>Cruelty and Love</h3>

<blockquote>What large, dark hands are those at the window<br>
Lifted, grasping in the yellow light<br>
Which makes its way through the curtain web<br>
        At my heart to-night?<br><br>

Ah, only the leaves! So leave me at rest,<br>
In the west I see a redness come<br>
Over the evening's burning breast &mdash; <br>
        For now the pain is numb.<br><br>

  The woodbine creeps abroad<br>
  Calling low to her lover:<br>
    The sunlit flirt who all the day<br>
    Has poised above her lips in play<br>
    And stolen kisses, shallow and gay<br>
    Of dalliance, now has gone away<br>
     &mdash; She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,<br>
  And when above her his broad wings hover<br>
  Then her bright breast she will uncover<br>
  And yield her honey-drop to her lover.<br><br>

  Into the yellow, evening glow<br>
  Saunters a man from the farm below,<br>
  Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed<br>
  Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.<br>
    The bird lies warm against the wall.<br>
    She glances quick her startled eyes<br>
    Towards him, then she turns away<br>
    Her small head, making warm display<br>
    Of red upon the throat. Her terrors sway<br>
    Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,<br><br>

    Whose plaintive cries start up as she flies<br>
    In one blue stoop from out the sties<br>
    Into the evening's empty hall.<br><br>

  Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes<br>
  Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,<br>
  Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,<br>
  Till the distance covers his dangerous tread.<br><br>

The rabbit presses back her ears,<br>
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes<br>
And crouches low: then with wild spring<br>
Spurts from the terror of the oncoming<br>
To be choked back, the wire ring<br>
Her frantic effort throttling:<br>
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!<br><br>

Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,<br>
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.<br>
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes<br>
And ready to open in brown surprise<br>
Should I not answer to his talk<br>
Or should he my tears surmise.<br><br>

I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair<br>
Watching the door open: he flashes bare<br>
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes<br>
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise<br>
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board<br>
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword<br>
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad<br>
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud<br>
His coming: he raises up my face to him<br>
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, smelling grim<br>
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare<br>
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,<br>
I only know I let him finger there<br>
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat<br>
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:<br>
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down<br>
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood<br>
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood<br>
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown<br>
Within him, die, and find death good.</blockquote>

<br>
<h3>The Wanderer</h3><br>


<blockquote>All day they loitered by the resting ships,<br>
Telling their beauties over, taking stock;<br>
At night the verdict left my messmates' lips,<br>
'The <i>Wanderer</i> is the finest ship in dock.'<br><br>

I had not seen her, but a friend, since drowned,<br>
Drew her, with painted ports, low, lovely, lean,<br>
Saying, '<i>The Wanderer</i>, clipper, outward bound,<br>
The loveliest ship my eyes have ever seen &mdash; <br><br>

'Perhaps to-morrow you will see her sail.<br>
She sails at sunrise': but the morrow showed<br>
No <i>Wanderer</i> setting forth for me to hail;<br>
Far down the stream men pointed where she rode,<br><br>

Rode the great trackway to the sea, dim, dim,<br>
Already gone before the stars were gone.<br>
I saw her at the sea-line's smoky rim<br>
Grow swiftly vaguer as they towed her on.<br><br>

Soon even her masts were hidden in the haze<br>
Beyond the city; she was on her course<br>
To trample billows for a hundred days;<br>
That afternoon the norther gathered force,<br><br>

Blowing a small snow from a point of east.<br>
'Oh, fair for her,' we said, 'to take her south.'<br>
And in our spirits, as the wind increased,<br>
We saw her there, beyond the river mouth,<br><br>

Setting her side-lights in the wildering dark,<br>
To glint upon mad water, while the gale<br>
Roared like a battle, snapping like a shark,<br>
And drunken seamen struggled with the sail;<br><br>

While with sick hearts her mates put out of mind<br>
Their little children left astern, ashore,<br>
And the gale's gathering made the darkness blind,<br>
Water and air one intermingled roar.<br><br>

Then we forgot her, for the fiddlers played,<br>
Dancing and singing held our merry crew;<br>
The old ship moaned a little as she swayed.<br>
It blew all night, oh, bitter hard it blew!<br><br>

So that at midnight I was called on deck<br>
To keep an anchor-watch: I heard the sea<br>
Roar past in white procession filled with wreck;<br>
Intense bright frosty stars burned over me,<br><br>

And the Greek brig beside us dipped and dipped<br>
White to the muzzle like a half-tide rock,<br>
Drowned to the mainmast with the seas she shipped;<br>
Her cable-swivels clanged at every shock.<br><br>

And like a never-dying force, the wind<br>
Roared till we shouted with it, roared until<br>
Its vast vitality of wrath was thinned,<br>
Had beat its fury breathless and was still.<br><br>

By dawn the gale had dwindled into flaw,<br>
A glorious morning followed: with my friend<br>
I climbed the fo'c's'le-head to see; we saw<br>
The waters hurrying shorewards without end.<br><br>

Haze blotted out the river's lowest reach;<br>
Out of the gloom the steamers, passing by,<br>
Called with their sirens, hooting their sea-speech;<br>
Out of the dimness others made reply.<br><br>

And as we watched there came a rush of feet<br>
Charging the fo'c's'le till the hatchway shook.<br>
Men all about us thrust their way, or beat,<br>
Crying, 'The <i>Wanderer</i>! Down the river! Look!'<br><br>

I looked with them towards the dimness; there<br>
Gleamed like a spirit striding out of night<br>
A full-rigged ship unutterably fair,<br>
Her masts like trees in winter, frosty-bright.<br><br>

Foam trembled at her bows like wisps of wool;<br>
She trembled as she towed. I had not dreamed<br>
That work of man could be so beautiful,<br>
In its own presence and in what it seemed.<br><br>

'So she is putting back again,' I said.<br>
'How white with frost her yards are on the fore!'<br>
One of the men about me answer made,<br>
'That is not frost, but all her sails are tore,<br><br>

'Torn into tatters, youngster, in the gale;<br>
Her best foul-weather suit gone.' It was true,<br>
Her masts were white with rags of tattered sail<br>
Many as gannets when the fish are due.<br><br>

Beauty in desolation was her pride,<br>
Her crowned array a glory that had been;<br>
She faltered tow'rds us like a swan that died,<br>
But although ruined she was still a queen.<br><br>

'Put back with all her sails gone,' went the word;<br>
Then, from her signals flying, rumour ran,<br>
'The sea that stove her boats in killed her third;<br>
She has been gutted and has lost a man.'<br><br>

So, as though stepping to a funeral march,<br>
She passed defeated homewards whence she came<br>
Ragged with tattered canvas white as starch,<br>
A wild bird that misfortune had made tame.<br><br>

She was refitted soon: another took<br>
The dead man's office; then the singers hove<br>
Her capstan till the snapping hawsers shook;<br>
Out, with a bubble at her bows, she drove.<br><br>

Again they towed her seawards, and again<br>
We, watching, praised her beauty, praised her trim,<br>
Saw her fair house-flag flutter at the main,<br>
And slowly saunter seawards, dwindling dim;<br><br>

And wished her well, and wondered, as she died,<br>
How, when her canvas had been sheeted home,<br>
Her quivering length would sweep into her stride,<br>
Making the greenness milky with her foam.<br><br>

But when we rose next morning, we discerned<br>
Her beauty once again a shattered thing;<br>
Towing to dock the <i>Wanderer</i> returned,<br>
A wounded sea-bird with a broken wing.<br><br>

A spar was gone, her rigging's disarray<br>
Told of a worse disaster than the last;<br>
Like draggled hair dishevelled hung the stay,<br>
Drooping and beating on the broken mast.<br><br>

Half-mast upon her flagstaff hung her flag;<br>
Word went among us how the broken spar<br>
Had gored her captain like an angry stag,<br>
And killed her mate a half-day from the bar.<br><br>

She passed to dock upon the top of flood.<br>
An old man near me shook his head and swore:<br>
'Like a bad woman, she has tasted blood &mdash; <br>
There'll be no trusting in her any more.'<br><br>

We thought it truth, and when we saw her there<br>
Lying in dock, beyond, across the stream,<br>
We would forget that we had called her fair,<br>
We thought her murderess and the past a dream.<br><br>

And when she sailed again we watched in awe,<br>
Wondering what bloody act her beauty planned,<br>
What evil lurked behind the thing we saw,<br>
What strength was there that thus annulled man's hand,<br><br>

How next its triumph would compel man's will<br>
Into compliance with external Fate,<br>
How next the powers would use her to work ill<br>
On suffering men; we had not long to wait.<br><br>

For soon the outcry of derision rose,<br>
'Here comes the <i>Wanderer</i>!' the expected cry.<br>
Guessing the cause, our mockings joined with those<br>
Yelled from the shipping as they towed her by.<br><br>

She passed us close, her seamen paid no heed<br>
To what was called: they stood, a sullen group,<br>
Smoking and spitting, careless of her need,<br>
Mocking the orders given from the poop.<br><br>

Her mates and boys were working her; we stared.<br>
What was the reason of this strange return,<br>
This third annulling of the thing prepared?<br>
No outward evil could our eyes discern.<br><br>

Only like someone who has formed a plan<br>
Beyond the pitch of common minds, she sailed,<br>
Mocked and deserted by the common man,<br>
Made half divine to me for having failed.<br><br>

We learned the reason soon; below the town<br>
A stay had parted like a snapping reed,<br>
'Warning,' the men thought, 'not to take her down.'<br>
They took the omen, they would not proceed.<br><br>

Days passed before another crew would sign.<br>
The <i>Wanderer</i> lay in dock alone, unmanned,<br>
Feared as a thing possessed by powers malign,<br>
Bound under curses not to leave the land.<br><br>

But under passing Time fear passes too;<br>
That terror passed, the sailors' hearts grew bold.<br>
We learned in time that she had found a crew<br>
And was bound out and southwards as of old.<br><br>

And in contempt we thought, 'A little while<br>
Will bring her back again, dismantled, spoiled.<br>
It is herself; she cannot change her style;<br>
She has the habit now of being foiled.'<br><br>

So when a ship appeared among the haze<br>
We thought, 'The <i>Wanderer</i> back again'; but no,<br>
No <i>Wanderer</i> showed for many, many days,<br>
Her passing lights made other waters glow.<br><br>

But we would often think and talk of her,<br>
Tell newer hands her story, wondering, then,<br>
Upon what ocean she was <i>Wanderer</i>,<br>
Bound to the cities built by foreign men.<br><br>

And one by one our little conclave thinned,<br>
Passed into ships, and sailed, and so away,<br>
To drown in some great roaring of the wind,<br>
Wanderers themselves, unhappy fortune's prey.<br><br>

And Time went by me making memory dim.<br>
Yet still I wondered if the <i>Wanderer</i> fared<br>
Still pointing to the unreached ocean's rim,<br>
Brightening the water where her breast was bared.<br><br>

And much in ports abroad I eyed the ships,<br>
Hoping to see her well-remembered form<br>
Come with a curl of bubbles at her lips<br>
Bright to her berth, the sovereign of the storm.<br><br>

I never did, and many years went by;<br>
Then, near a Southern port, one Christmas Eve,<br>
I watched a gale go roaring through the sky,<br>
Making the cauldrons of the clouds upheave.<br><br>

Then the wrack tattered and the stars appeared,<br>
Millions of stars that seemed to speak in fire;<br>
A byre-cock cried aloud that morning neared,<br>
The swinging wind-vane flashed upon the spire.<br><br>

And soon men looked upon a glittering earth,<br>
Intensely sparkling like a world new-born;<br>
Only to look was spiritual birth,<br>
So bright the raindrops ran along the thorn.<br><br>

So bright they were, that one could almost pass<br>
Beyond their twinkling to the source, and know<br>
The glory pushing in the blade of grass,<br>
That hidden soul which makes the flowers grow.<br><br>

That soul was there apparent, not revealed;<br>
Unearthly meanings covered every tree;<br>
That wet grass grew in an immortal field;<br>
Those waters fed some never-wrinkled sea.<br><br>

The scarlet berries in the hedge stood out<br>
Like revelations, but the tongue unknown;<br>
Even in the brooks a joy was quick; the trout<br>
Rushed in a dumbness dumb to me alone.<br><br>

All of the valley was aloud with brooks;<br>
I walked the morning, breasting up the fells,<br>
Taking again lost childhood from the rooks,<br>
Whose cawing came above the Christmas bells.<br><br>

I had not walked that glittering world before,<br>
But up the hill a prompting came to me,<br>
'This line of upland runs along the shore:<br>
Beyond the hedgerow I shall see the sea.'<br><br>

And on the instant from beyond away<br>
That long familiar sound, a ship's bell, broke<br>
The hush below me in the unseen bay.<br>
Old memories came: that inner prompting spoke.<br><br>

And bright above the hedge a seagull's wings<br>
Flashed and were steady upon empty air.<br>
'A Power unseen,' I cried, 'prepares these things;<br>
'Those are her bells, the <i>Wanderer</i> is there.'<br><br>

So, hurrying to the hedge and looking down,<br>
I saw a mighty bay's wind-crinkled blue<br>
Ruffling the image of a tranquil town,<br>
With lapsing waters glittering as they grew.<br><br>

And near me in the road the shipping swung,<br>
So stately and so still in such great peace<br>
That like to drooping crests their colours hung,<br>
Only their shadows trembled without cease.<br><br>

I did but glance upon those anchored ships.<br>
Even as my thought had told, I saw her plain;<br>
Tense, like a supple athlete with lean hips,<br>
Swiftness at pause, the <i>Wanderer</i> come again &mdash; <br><br>

Come as of old a queen, untouched by Time,<br>
Resting the beauty that no seas could tire,<br>
Sparkling, as though the midnight's rain were rime,<br>
Like a man's thought transfigured into fire.<br><br>

And as I looked, one of her men began<br>
To sing some simple tune of Christmas Day;<br>
Among her crew the song spread, man to man,<br>
Until the singing rang across the bay;<br><br>

And soon in other anchored ships the men<br>
Joined in the singing with clear throats, until<br>
The farm-boy heard it up the windy glen,<br>
Above the noise of sheep-bells on the hill.<br><br>

Over the water came the lifted song &mdash; <br>
Blind pieces in a mighty game we swing;<br>
Life's battle is a conquest for the strong;<br>
The meaning shows in the defeated thing.</blockquote>

<h3>Milk for the Cat</h3>

<blockquote>When the tea is brought at five o'clock,<br>
And all the neat curtains are drawn with care,<br>
The little black cat with bright green eyes<br>
Is suddenly purring there.<br><br>

At first she pretends, having nothing to do,<br>
She has come in merely to blink by the grate,<br>
But, though tea may be late or the milk may be sour,<br>
She is never late.<br><br>

And presently her agate eyes<br>
Take a soft large milky haze,<br>
And her independent casual glance<br>
Becomes a stiff, hard gaze.<br><br>

Then she stamps her claws or lifts her ears,<br>
Or twists her tail and begins to stir,<br>
Till suddenly all her lithe body becomes<br>
One breathing, trembling purr.<br><br>

The children eat and wriggle and laugh,<br>
The two old ladies stroke their silk:<br>
But the cat is grown small and thin with desire,<br>
Transformed to a creeping lust for milk.<br><br>

The white saucer like some full moon descends<br>
At last from the clouds of the table above;<br>
She sighs and dreams and thrills and glows,<br>
Transfigured with love.<br><br>

She nestles over the shining rim,<br>
Buries her chin in the creamy sea;<br>
Her tail hangs loose; each drowsy paw<br>
Is doubled under each bending knee.<br><br>

A long, dim ecstasy holds her life;<br>
Her world is an infinite shapeless white,<br>
Till her tongue has curled the last holy drop,<br>
Then she sinks back into the night,<br><br>

Draws and dips her body to heap<br>
Her sleepy nerves in the great arm-chair,<br>
Lies defeated and buried deep<br>
Three or four hours unconscious there.</blockquote>

Of the quiet sunniness.<br>
And there the goats, day after day,<br>
  Stray in sunny quietness,<br>
Cropping here and cropping there,<br>
  As they pause and turn and pass,<br>
Now a bit of heather spray,<br>
  Now a mouthful of the grass.<br><br>

In the deeper sunniness,<br>
  In the place where nothing stirs,<br>
Quietly in quietness,<br>
  In the quiet of the furze,<br>
For a time they come and lie<br>
Staring on the roving sky.<br><br>

If you approach they run away,<br>
  They leap and stare, away they bound,<br>
  With a sudden angry sound,<br>
To the sunny quietude;<br>
  Crouching down where nothing stirs<br>
  In the silence of the furze,<br>
Couching down again to brood<br>
In the sunny solitude.<br><br>

If I were as wise as they<br>
  I would stray apart and brood,<br>
I would beat a hidden way<br>
Through the quiet heather spray<br>
  To a sunny solitude;<br><br>

And should you come I'd run away,<br>
  I would make an angry sound,<br>
  I would stare and turn and bound<br>
To the deeper quietude,<br>
  To the place where nothing stirs<br>
  In the silence of the furze.<br><br>

In that airy quietness<br>
  I would think as long as they;<br>
Through the quiet sunniness<br>
  I would stray away to brood<br>
By a hidden beaten way<br>
  In a sunny solitude.<br><br>

I would think until I found<br>
  Something I can never find,<br>
Something lying on the ground,<br>
  In the bottom of my mind.</blockquote>

<i>ACT I</i><br>
<br>
<i>Scene: A public-house kitchen. HUFF the Farmer and SOLLERS the
Wainwright talking; another man, a stranger, sitting silent.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Ay, you may think we're well off &mdash; </blockquote><br>


<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>                 Now for croaks,<br>
Old toad! who's trodden on you now? &mdash; Go on;<br>
But if you can, croak us a new tune.</blockquote><br>


<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>                        Ay,<br>
You think you're well off &mdash; and don't grab my words<br>
Before they're spoken &mdash; but some folks, I've heard,<br>
Pity us, living quiet in the valley.</blockquote><br>


<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Well, I suppose 'tis their affair.</blockquote><br>


<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>                  Is it?<br>
But what I mean to say, &mdash; if they think small<br>
Of us that live in the valley, mayn't it show<br>
That we aren't all so happy as we think?</blockquote><br>

<i>MERRICK the Smith comes in.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Quick, cider! I believe I've swallowed a coal.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Good evening. True, the heat's a wonder to-night.</blockquote><br>

<i>Smith draws himself cider.</i><br>
<br>
<br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Haven't you brought your flute? We've all got room<br>
For music in our minds to-night, I'll swear.<br>
Working all day in the sun do seem to push<br>
The thought out of your brain.</blockquote><br>


<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>           O, 'tis the sun<br>
Has trodden on you? That's what makes you croak?<br>
Ay, whistle him somewhat: put a tune in his brain;<br>
He'll else croak us out of pleasure with drinking.</blockquote><br>


<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>'Tis quenching, I believe. &mdash; A tune? Too hot.<br>

You want a fiddler.</blockquote><br>


<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>      Nay, I want your flute.<br>
I like a piping sound, not scraping o' guts.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>This is no weather for a man to play<br>
Flutes or music at all that asks him spend<br>
His breath and spittle: you want both yourself  <br>
These oven days. Wait till a fiddler comes.   </blockquote><br>


<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote> Who ever comes down here?</blockquote><br>


<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>There's someone come.</blockquote><br>

<i>Pointing with his pipe to the stranger.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Good evening, mister. Are you a man for tunes?</blockquote><br>


<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>And if I was I'ld give you none to-night.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Well, no offence: there's no offence, I hope,<br>
In taking a dummy for a tuneful man.<br>
Is it for can't or won't you are?</blockquote><br>


<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>You wouldn't, if you carried in your mind<br>
What I've been carrying all day.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>What's that?</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>You wait; you'll know about it soon; O yes,<br>
Soon enough it will find you out and rouse you.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Now ain't that just the way we go down here?<br>
Here in the valley we're like dogs in a yard,<br>
Chained to our kennels and wall'd in all round,<br>
And not a sound of the world jumps over our hills.<br>
And when there comes a passenger among us,<br>
One who has heard what's stirring out beyond,<br>
'Tis a grutchy mumchance fellow in the dismals!</blockquote><br>


<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>News, is it, you want? I could give you news! &mdash; <br>
I wonder, did you ever hate to feel<br>
The earth so fine and splendid?</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

 <blockquote>                   Oh, you're one<br>
Has stood in the brunt of the world's wickedness,<br>
Like me? But listen, and I'll give you a tale<br>
Of wicked things done in this little valley,<br>
Done against me, will surely make you think<br>
The Devil here fetcht up his masterpiece.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Ah, but it's hot enough without you talking<br>
Your old hell fire about that pair of sinners.<br>
Leave them alone and drink.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>             I'll smell them grilling<br>
One of these days.</blockquote><br>


<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>     But there'll be nought to drink<br>
When that begins! Best keep your skin full now.</blockquote><br>


<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>What do I care for wickedness? Let those<br>
Who've played with dirt, and thought the game was bold,<br>
Make much of it while they can: there's a big thing<br>
Coming down to us, ay, well on its road,<br>
Will make their ploys seem mighty piddling sport.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>This is a fool; or else it's what I think, &mdash;  <br>
The world now breeds such crowd that they've no room<br>
For well-grown sins: they hatch 'em small as flies.<br>
But you stay here, out of the world awhile,<br>
Here where a man's mind, and a woman's mind,<br>
Can fling out large in wickedness: you'll see<br>
Something monstrous here, something dreadful.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>I've seen enough of that. Though it was only<br>
Fancying made me see it, it was enough:<br>
I've seen the folk of the world yelling aghast,<br>
Scurrying to hide themselves. I want nought else<br>
Monstrous and dreadful. &mdash; </blockquote><br>


<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>         What had roused 'em so?<br>
Some house afire?</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>      A huzzy flogged to death<br>
For her hard-faced adultery?</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger (too intent to hear them):</i>

<blockquote>                     Oh to think of it!<br>
Talk, do, chatter some nonsense, else I'll think:<br>
And then I'm feeling like a grub that crawls<br>
All abroad in a dusty road; and high<br>
Above me, and shaking the ground beneath me, come<br>
Wheels of a thundering wain, right where I'm plodding.</blockquote><br>


<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Queer thinking, that.</blockquote><br>


<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>      And here's a queerer thing.<br>
I have a sort of lust in me, pushing me still<br>
Into that terrible way of thinking, like<br>
Black men in India lie them down and long<br>
To feel their holy wagon crack their spines.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Do you mean beetles? I've driven over scores,<br>
They sprawling on their backs, or standing mazed.<br>
I never knew they liked it.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>        He means frogs.<br>
I know what's in his mind. When I was young<br>
My mother would catch us frogs and set them down,<br>
Lapt in a screw of paper, in the ruts,<br>
And carts going by would quash 'em; and I'ld laugh,<br>
And yet be thinking, 'Suppose it was myself<br>
Twisted stiff in huge paper, and wheels<br>
Big as the wall of a barn treading me flat!'</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>I know what's in his mind: just madness it is.<br>
He's lookt too hard at his fellows in the world;<br>
Sight of their monstrous hearts, like devils in cages,<br>
Has jolted all the gearing of his wits.<br>
It needs a tough brain, ay, a brain like mine,<br>
To pore on ugly sin and not go mad.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>Madness! You're not far out. &mdash; I came up here<br>
To be alone and quiet in my thoughts,<br>
Alone in my own dreadful mind. The path,<br>
Of red sand trodden hard, went up between<br>
High hedges overgrown of hawthorn blowing<br>
White as clouds; ay it seemed burrowed through<br>
A white sweet-smelling cloud, &mdash; I walking there<br>
Small as a hare that runs its tunnelled drove<br>
Thro' the close heather. And beside my feet<br>
Blue greygles drifted gleaming over the grass;<br>
And up I climbed to sunlight green in birches,<br>
And the path turned to daisies among grass<br>
With bonfires of the broom beside, like flame<br>
Of burning straw: and I lookt into your valley.<br>
I could scarce look.<br>
Anger was smarting in my eyes like grit.<br>
O the fine earth and fine all for nothing!<br>
Mazed I walkt, seeing and smelling and hearing:<br>
The meadow lands all shining fearfully gold, &mdash; <br>
Cruel as fire the sight of them toucht my mind;<br>
Breathing was all a honey taste of clover<br>
And bean flowers: I would have rather had it<br>
Carrion, or the stink of smouldering brimstone.<br>
And larks aloft, the happy piping fools,<br>
And squealing swifts that slid on hissing wings,<br>
And yellowhammers playing spry in hedges.<br>
I never noted them before; but now &mdash; <br>
Yes, I was mad, and crying mad, to see<br>
The earth so fine, fine all for nothing!</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers (spits):</i>

<blockquote>Pst! yellowhammers! He talks gentry talk.<br>
That's worse than being mad.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>I tell you, you'll be feeling them to-morn<br>
And hating them to be so wonderful.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Let's have some sense. Where do you live?</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>              Nowhere.<br>
I'm always travelling.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Why, what's your trade?</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>A dowser.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>You're the man for me!</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>Not I.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Ho, this is better than a fiddler now!<br>
One of those fellows who have nerves so clever<br>
That they can feel the waters of underground<br>
Tingling in their fingers.<br>
You find me a spring in my high grazing-field,<br>
I'll give you what I save in trundling water.</blockquote><br>

<i>Stranger:</i>

<blockquote>I find you water now! &mdash; -No, but I'll find you<br>
Fire and fear and unbelievable death.</blockquote><br>

<i>VINE the Publican comes in.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>Are ye all served? Ay, seems so; what's your score?</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Two ciders.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote> Three.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>And two for me.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine (to Dowser):</i>

<blockquote>And you? </blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>Naught. I was waiting on you.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>Will you drink?</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>Ay! Drink! what else is left for a man to do<br>
Who knows what I know?</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>Good. What is't you know?<br>
You tell it out and set my trade a-buzzing.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote> He's queer. Give him his mug and ease his tongue.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>I had to swill the pigs: else I'd been here;<br>
But we've the old fashion in this house; you draw,<br>
I keep the score. Well, what's the worry on you?</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Oh he's in love.</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>You fleering grinning louts,<br>
I'll give it you now; now have it in your faces!</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Crimini, he's going to fight!</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>You try and fight with the thing that's on my side!</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>A ranter!</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>A boozy one then.</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>         Open yon door;<br>
'Tis dark enough by now. Open it, you.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>Hold on. Have you got something fierce outside?</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>A Russian bear?</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Dowsers can play strange games.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>No tricks!</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>This is a trick to rouse the world.</blockquote><br>

<i>He opens the door.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>Look out! Between the elms! There's my fierce thing.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>He means the star with the tail like a feather of fire.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Comet, it's called.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Do you mean the comet, mister?</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>What do you think of it?</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>         Pretty enough.<br>
But I saw a man loose off a rocket once;<br>
It made more stir and flare of itself; though yon<br>
Does better at steady burning.</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>          Stir and flare!<br>
You'll soon forget your rocket.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Tell you what<br>
I thought last night, now, going home. Says I,<br>
'Tis just like the look of a tadpole: if I saw<br>
A tadpole silver as a dace that swam<br>
Upside-down towards me through black water,<br>
I'ld see the plain spit of that star and his tail.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>And how does your thought go?</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>          It's what I know! &mdash; <br>
A tadpole and a rocket! &mdash; My dear God,<br>
And I can still laugh out! &mdash; What do you think<br>
Your tadpole's made of? What lets your rocket fling<br>
Those streaming sparks across the half of night,<br>
Splashing the burning spray of its haste among<br>
The quiet business of the other stars?<br>
Ay, that's a fiery jet it leaves behind<br>
In such enormous drift! What sort of fire<br>
Is spouted so, spouted and never quenching? &mdash; <br>
There is no name for that star's fire: it is<br>
The fire that was before the world was made,<br>
The fire that all the things we live among<br>
Remember being; and whitest fire we know<br>
Is its poor copy in their dreaming trance!</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>That would be hell fire.</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

      <blockquote>  Ay, if you like, hell fire,<br>
Hell fire flying through the night! 'Twould be<br>
A thing to blink about, a blast of it<br>
Swept in your face, eh? and a thing to set<br>
The whole stuff of the earth smoking rarely?<br>
Which of you said 'the heat's a wonder to-night'?<br>
You have not done with marvelling. There'll come<br>
A night when all your clothes are a pickle of sweat,<br>
And, for all that, the sweat on your salty skin<br>
Shall dry and crack, in the breathing of a wind<br>
That's like a draught come through an open'd furnace.<br>
The leafage of the trees shall brown and faint,<br>
All sappy growth turning to brittle rubbish<br>
As the near heat of the star strokes the green earth;<br>
And time shall brush the fields as visibly<br>
As a rough hand brushes against the nap<br>
Of gleaming cloth &mdash; killing the season's colour,<br>
Each hour charged with the wasting of a year;<br>
And sailors panting on their warping decks<br>
Will watch the sea steam like broth about them.<br>
You'll know what I know then! &mdash; That towering star<br>
Hangs like a fiery buzzard in the night<br>
Intent over our earth &mdash; Ay, now his journey<br>
Points, straight as a plummet's drop, down to us!</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Why, that's the end of the world!</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>You've said it now.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>What, soon? In a day or two?</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>You can't mean that!</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>End of the World! Well now, I never thought<br>
To hear the news of that. If you've the truth<br>
In what you say, likely this is an evening<br>
That we'll be talking over often and often.<br>
'How was it, Sellers?' I'll say; 'or you, Merrick,<br>
Do you mind clearly how he lookt?' &mdash; And then &mdash; <br>
"End of the world" he said, and drank &mdash; like that,<br>
Solemn!' &mdash; And right he was: he had it all<br>
As sure as I have when my sow's to farrow.</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>Are you making a joke of me? Keep your mind<br>
For tippling while you can.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>          Was that a joke?<br>
I'm always bad at seeing 'em, even my own.</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>A fool's! 'Twill cheer you when the earth blows up.<br>
Like as it were all gunpowder.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>          You mean<br>
The star will butt his burning head against us?<br>
'Twill knock the world to flinders, I suppose?</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

<blockquote>Ay, or with that wild, monstrous tail of his<br>
Smash down upon the air, and make it bounce<br>
Like water under the flukes of a harpooned whale,<br>
And thrash it to a poisonous fire; and we<br>
And all the life of the world drowned in blazing!</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>'Twill be a handsome sight. If my old wife<br>
Were with me now! This would have suited her.<br>
'I do like things to happen!' she would say;<br>
Never shindy enough for her; and now<br>
She's gone, and can't be seeing this!</blockquote><br>

<i>Dowser:</i>

 <blockquote>          You poor fool.<br>
How will it be a sight to you, when your eyes<br>
Are scorcht to little cinders in your head?</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>Whether or no, there must be folks outside<br>
Willing to know of this. I'll scatter your news.
</blockquote><br>

<i>He goes.</i><br>
<br>
<i>A short-pause: then SOLLERS breaks out.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Sollers:</i>

But Sollers here and I, we've had to drill<br>
Sinew and muscle into their hard lesson,<br>
Until they work in timber and glowing iron<br>
As kindly as I pick up my pint: your work<br>
Grows in your nature, like plain speech in a child,<br>
But we have learnt to think in a foreign tongue;<br>
And something must come out of all our skill!<br>
We shan't go sliding down as glib as you<br>
Into notions of the End of the World.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Give me a tree, you may say, and give me steel,  <br>
And I'll put forth my shapely mind; I'll make,<br>
Out of my head like telling a well-known tale,<br>
A wain that goes as comely on the roads<br>
As a ship sailing, the lines of it true as gospel.<br>
Have I learnt that all for nothing? &mdash; O no!<br>
End of the World? It wouldn't do at all.<br>

So seriously busy, trade and craft, &mdash; <br>
Life with her skill of a million years' perfection<br>
To make her heart's delighted glorying<br>
Of sunlight, and of clouds about the moon,<br>
Spring lighting her daffodils, and corn<br>
Ripening gold to ruddy, and giant seas,<br>
And mountains sitting in their purple clothes &mdash; <br>

Of thundering fire; and naught but yellow rubbish<br>
Parcht on the perishing ground, and there are tongues<br>
Chapt with thirst, glad to lap stinking ponds,<br>
And pale glaring faces spying about<br>
On the earth withering, terror the only speech!<br>
Look for me then, and see me stand alone<br>
Easy and pleasant in the midst of it all.<br>
Did you not make your merry scoff of me?<br>
Was it your talk, that when yon shameless pair<br>
Threw their wantoning in my face like dirt,<br>
I had no heart against them but to grumble?<br>

This is the man I told you of when you<br>
Were talking small of sin. You made it out,<br>
Did you, a fool's mere nasty game, like dogs<br>
That snuggle in muck, and grin and roll themselves<br>
With snorting pleasure? Ah, but you are wrong.<br>
'Tis something that goes thrusting dreadfully<br>
Its wilful bravery of evil against<br>
The worth and right of goodness in the world:<br>
Ay, do you see how his face still brags at me?<br>
And long it has been, the time he's had to walk<br>
Lording about me with his wickedness.<br>
Do you know what he dared? I had a wife,<br>
A flighty pretty linnet-headed girl,<br>
But mine: he practised on her with his eyes;<br>
He knew of luring glances, and she went<br>
After his calling lust: and all since then<br>
They've lived together, fleering in my face,<br>
Pleased in sight of the windows of my house<br>
With doing wrong, and making my disgrace.<br>
O but wait here with me; wait till your news <br>
Is not to be mistaken, for the way <br>
The earth buckles and singes like hot boards:<br>
You'll surely see how dreadful sin can be<br>
Then, when you mark these two running about,<br>
With raging fear for what they did against me<br>
Buzzing close to their souls, stinging their hearts,<br>
And they like scampering beasts when clegs are fierce,<br>
Or flinging themselves low as the ground to writhe,<br>
Their arms hugging their desperate heads. And then<br>
You'll see what 'tis to be an upright man,<br>
Who keeps a patient anger for his wrongs<br>
Thinking of judgment coming &mdash; you will see that<br>
When you mark how my looks hunt these wretches,<br>
And smile upon their groans and posturing anguish.<br>
O watch how calm I'll be, when the blazing air<br>
Judges their wickedness; you watch me then<br>
Looking delighted, like a nobleman<br>
Who sees his horse winning an easy race.</blockquote><br>

The star that breathes a horrible fury of fire<br>
Like glaring fog into the empty night;<br>

Shrivel and spin like paper in a furnace.<br>

Bound to come, I suppose. 'Tis a poor thing<br>

But, now or another time, 'twas bound to be. &mdash; <br>
I have been thinking back. When I was a lad<br>
I was delighted with my life: there seemed<br>
Naught but things to enjoy. Say we were bathing:<br>
There'ld be the cool smell of the water, and cool<br>
The splashing under the trees: but I did loathe<br>
The sinking mud slithering round my feet,<br>
And I did love to loathe it so! And then<br>
We'ld troop to kill a wasp's nest; and for sure<br>
I would be stung; and if I liked the dusk    <br>
And singing and the game of it all, I loved <br>
The smart of the stings, and fleeing the buzzing furies.<br>
And sometimes I'ld be looking at myself<br>
Making so much of everything; there'ld seem<br>
A part of me speaking about myself:<br>
'You know, this is much more than being happy.<br>
'Tis hunger of some power in you, that lives<br>
On your heart's welcome for all sorts of luck,<br>
But always looks beyond you for its meaning.'<br>
And that's the way the world's kept going on,<br>
I believe now. Misery and delight<br>
Have both had liking welcome from it, both<br>
Have made the world keen to be glad and sorry.<br>
For why? It felt the living power thrive<br>
The more it made everything, good and bad,<br>
Its own belonging, forged to its own affair, &mdash; <br>
The living power that would do wonders some day.<br>
I don't know if you take me?</blockquote><br>

Looking for worth in what was still to come;<br>
And now there's a stop to our innings. Well, that's fair:<br>
I've been a living man, and might have been<br>
Nothing at all! I've had the world about me,<br>
And felt it as my own concern. What else<br>
Should I be crying for? I've had my turn.<br>
The world may be for the sake of naught at last,<br>

With his neck stretcht to have his chin poke up,  <br>
And silly feet busy and always going;<br>
Paddling round the story of your good life,<br>
Your small good life, and how the decent men<br>
Have jeered at your wry antic.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

 <blockquote>               My good life!<br>
And what good has my goodness been to me?<br>
You show me that! Somebody show me that!<br>
A caterpillar munching a cabbage-heart,<br>
Always drudging further and further from<br>
The sounds and lights of the world, never abroad<br>
Nor flying free in warmth and air sweet-smelling:<br>
A crawling caterpillar, eating his life<br>
In a deaf dark &mdash; that's my gain of goodness!<br>
And it's too late to hatch out now! &mdash; <br>
I can but fancy what I might have been;<br>
I scarce know how to sin! &mdash; But I believe<br>
A long while back I did come near to it.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Well done! &mdash; O but I should have guesst all this!</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>I was in Droitwich; and the sight of the place<br>
Is where they cook the brine: a long dark shed,<br>
Hot as an oven, full of a grey steam<br>
And ruddy light that leaks out of the furnace;<br>
And stirring the troughs, ladling the brine that boils<br>
As thick as treacle, a double standing row,<br>
Women &mdash; boldly talking in wicked jokes<br>
All day long. I went to see 'em. It was<br>
A wonderful rousing sight. Not one of them<br>
Was really wearing clothes: half of a sack<br>
Pinned in an apron was enough for most,<br>
And here and there might be a petticoat;<br>
But nothing in the way of bodices. &mdash; <br>
O, they knew words to shame a carter's face!</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>This is the thought you would be quiet in!</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Where else can I be quiet? Now there's an end<br>
Of daring, 'tis the one place my life has made<br>
Where I may try to dare in thought. I mind,<br>
When I stood in the midst of those bare women,<br>
All at once, outburst with a rising buzz,<br>
A mob of flying thoughts was wild in me:<br>
Things I might do swarmed in my brain pell-mell,<br>
Like a heap of flies kickt into humming cloud.<br>
I beat them down; and now I cannot tell<br>
For certain what they were. I can call up<br>
Naught venturesome and darting like their style;<br>
Very tame braveries now! &mdash; O Shale's the man<br>
To smile upon the End of the World; 'tis Shale<br>
Has lived the bold stiff fashion, and filled himself<br>
With thinking pride in what a man may do. &mdash; <br>
I wish I had seen those women more than once!</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>Well, here's an upside down! This is old Huff!<br>
What have you been in your heart all these years?<br>
The man you were or the new man you are?</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Just a dead flesh!</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>     Nay, Huff the good man at least  <br>
Was something alive, though snarling like trapt vermin.<br>
But this? What's this for the figure of a man?<br>
'Tis a boy's smutty picture on a wall.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>I was alive, was I? Like a blind bird<br>
That flies and cannot see the flight it takes,<br>
Feeling it with mere rowing of its wings.<br>
But Shale &mdash; he's had a stirring sense of what he is.</blockquote><br>

<i>Shouting outside. Then SOLLERS walks in again, very quiet and steady.
He stands in the middle, looking down on the floor.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>What do they holla for there?</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>The earth.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>The earth?</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>The earth's afire.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>The earth blazing already?</blockquote><br>

<i>Shouts again.</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>O, not so soon as this?</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>What sort of a fire?</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>The earth has caught the heat of the star, you fool.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>I know: there's come some dazzle in your eyes<br>
From facing to the star; a lamp would do it.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>It will be that. Your sight, being so strained,<br>
Is flashing of itself.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>        Say what you like.<br>
There's a red flare out of the land beyond<br>
Looking over the hills into our valley.<br>
The thing's begun, 'tis certain. Go and see.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>I won't see that. I will stay here.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>                  Ay, creep<br>
Into your oven. You'll be cooler there. &mdash; <br>
O my God, we'll all be coals in an hour!</blockquote><br>

<i>Shouts again.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>And I have naught to stand in my heart upright,<br>
And vow it made my living time worth more<br>
Than if my time had been death in a grave!</blockquote><br>

<i>Several persons run in.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The Crowd:</i>

<blockquote>1. The river's the place!<br><br>

2.                       The only safe place now!<br><br>

3. Best all charge down to the river!<br><br>

4.                             For there's a blaze,<br>
A travelling blaze comes racing along the earth.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>'Tis true. The air's red-hot above the hills.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Crowd:</i>

<blockquote>1. Ay, but the burning now crests the hill-tops<br>
In quiver of yellow flame.<br><br>

2.                        And a great smoke<br>
Waving and tumbling upward.<br><br>

3.                             The river now!  <br><br>

4. The only place we have, not to be roasted!  </blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>And what will make us water-rats or otters,<br>
To keep our breath still living through a dive<br>
That lasts until the earth's burnt out? Or how<br>
Would that trick serve, when we stand up to gasp,<br>
And find the star waiting for our plunged heads<br>
To knock them into pummy?</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>                 Scarce more dazed<br>
I'ld be with that than now. I shall be bound,<br>
When I'm to give my wife the tale of it all,<br>
To be devising: more of this to-do<br>
My mind won't carry.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>        O ashamed I am,<br>
Ashamed! &mdash; It needn't have been downright feats,<br>
Such as the braving men, the like of Shale,<br>
Do easily, and smile, keeping them up.<br>
If I could look back to one manful hour<br>
Of romping in the face of all my goodness! &mdash; </blockquote><br>

<i>SHALE comes in, dragging Mrs HUFF by the hand.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>Huff! Where's Huff? &mdash; Huff, you must take her back!<br>
You'll take her back? She's yours: I give her up.
</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Belike here's something bold again.</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff (to SHALE):</i>

<blockquote>         Once more,<br>
  Listen.</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>    I will not listen. There's no time<br>
For aught but giving you back where you belong;<br>
And that's with you, Huff. Take her.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>                            Here is depth<br>
I cannot see to. Is it your last fling? &mdash; <br>
The dolt I am in these things! &mdash; What's this way<br>
You've found of living wickedly to the end?</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>Scorn as you please, but take her back, man, take her.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>But she's my wife! Take her back now? What for?</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

<blockquote>What for? Have you not known of thieves that throw<br>
Their robbery down, soon as they hear a step<br>
Sounding behind them on the road, and run<br>
A long way off, and pull an honest face?<br>
Ay, see Shale's eyes practising baby-looks!<br>
He never stole, not he!</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>Don't hear her talk.</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

<blockquote>But he was a talker once! Love was the thing;<br>
And love, he swore, would make the wrong go right,<br>
And Huff was a kind of devil &mdash; and that's true &mdash;  &mdash; </blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote> What? I've been devilish and never knew?</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

<blockquote>The devil in the world that hates all love.<br>
But Shale said, he'd the love in him would hold<br>
If the world's frame and the fate of men were crackt.</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote> What I said!<br>
Whoever thought the world was going to crack?</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

<blockquote>And now he hears someone move behind him. &mdash; <br>
They'll say, perhaps, 'You stole this!' &mdash; Down it goes,<br>
Thrown to the dirty road &mdash; thrown to Huff!</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>Yes, to the owner.</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

<blockquote>     It was not such brave thieving.<br>
You did not take me from my owner, Shale:<br>
There's an old robber will do that some day,<br>
Not you.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote> Were you thinking of me then, missis?</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff (still to SHALE):</i>

<blockquote>You found me lost in the dirt: I was with Huff.<br>
You lifted me from there; and there again,<br>
Like a frightened urchin, you're for throwing me.</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>Let it be that! I'm firm<br>
  Not to have you about me, when the thing,<br>
  Whatever it is, that's standing now behind<br>
  The burning of the world, comes out on us.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>The way men cheat! This windle-stalk was he<br>
Would hold a show of spirit for the world<br>
To study while it ruined! &mdash; Make what you please<br>
Of your short wrangle here, but leave me out.<br>
I have my thoughts &mdash; O far enough from this.</blockquote><br>

<i>Turning away.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Shale (seizing him):</i>

<blockquote>You shall not put me off. I tell you, Huff,<br>
You are to take her back now.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>              Take her back!<br>
  And what has she to do with what I want?</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>Isn't she yours? I must be quit of her;<br>
I'll not be in the risk of keeping her.<br>
She's yours!
</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff: </i>

<blockquote>And what's the good of her now to me?<br>
What's the good of a woman whom I've married?</blockquote><br>

<i>During this, WARP the molecatcher has come in.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>Shale and Huff at their old pother again!</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick: </i>

<blockquote>The molecatcher.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers: </i>

<blockquote>Warp, have you travelled far?<br>
Is it through frenzy and ghastly crowds you've come?</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>Have you got dreadful things to tell us, Warp?</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp: </i>

<blockquote>Why, no.<br>
But seemingly you'ld have had news for me,<br>
If I'd come later. Is Huff to murder Shale,<br>
Or Shale for murdering Huff? One way or 'tother,<br>
'Tis time 'twas settled surely. &mdash; Mrs Huff,<br>
They're neither of them worth you: here's your health.</blockquote><br>

<i>Draws and drinks.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Where have you been? Are you not new from folk<br>
That throng together in a pelting horror?</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>Do you think the whole land hearkens to the flurry<br>
Of an old dog biting at a young dog's throat?</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>No, no! Not their shrill yapping; you've not heard<br>
The world's near to be blasted?</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>                    No mutter of it.<br>
I am from walking the whole ground I trap,<br>
And there's no likeness of it, but the moles<br>
I've turned up dead and dried out of three counties.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>Why, but the fire that's eating the whole earth;<br>
The breath of it is scarlet in the sky!<br>
You must have seen that?</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>                But what's taken you?<br>
You are like boys that go to hunt for ghosts,<br>
And turn the scuttle of rats to a roused demon<br>
Crawling to shut the door of the barn they search.<br>
Fire? Yes, fire is playing a pretty game<br>
Yonder, and has its golden fun to itself,<br>
Seemingly.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>You don't know what 'tis that burns?</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>Call me a mole and not a molecatcher<br>
If I do not. It is a rick that burns;<br>
And a strange thing I'll count it if the rick<br>
Be not old Huff's.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>That flare a fired stack?</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Only one of my ricks alight? O Glory!<br>
There may be chance for me yet.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Best take the train<br>
To Droitwich, Huff.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine (at the door):  </i>

<blockquote>It would be like a stack,<br>
But for the star.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers (to WARP):</i>

<blockquote>Yes, as you're so clever,<br>
You can talk down maybe yon brandishing star!
</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>O, 'tis the star has flickt your brains? Indeed,  <br>
The tail swings long enough to-night for that. <br>
Well, look your best at it; 'tis off again<br>
To go its rounds, they tell me, from now on;<br>
And the next time it swaggers in our sky,<br>
The moles a long while will have tired themselves<br>
Of having their easy joke with me.</blockquote><br>

<i>A pause.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>                   You mean<br>
The flight of the star is from us?</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>                     But the world,<br>
The whole world reckons on it battering us!</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>Who told you that?</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>A dowser.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Where's he gone?</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>A dowser! say a tramping conjurer.<br>
You'll believe aught, if you believe a dowser.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>I had it in me to be doubting him.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>The noise you made was like that! But I knew<br>
You'ld laugh at me, so sure you were the world<br>
Would shiver like a bursting grindlestone:<br>
Else I'ld have said out loud, 'twas a fool's whimsy.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>Where are you now? What am I now to think?<br>
Your minds run round in puzzles, like chased hares.<br>
I cannot sight them.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Think of going to bed.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote> And dreaming prices for your pigs.</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

 <blockquote>                 O Warp,<br>
You should have seen Vine crying! The moon, he said,<br>
The silver moon! Just like an onion 'twas<br>
To stir the water in his eyes.</blockquote><br>

<i>Sollers:</i>

<blockquote>               He's left<br>
A puddle of his tears where he was droopt<br>
Over the table.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>    There's to be no ruin? &mdash; <br>
But what's the word of a molecatcher, to crow<br>
So ringing over a dowser's word?</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>                      I'll tell you.<br>
These dowsers live on lies: my trade's the truth.<br>
I can read moles, and the way they've dug their journeys,<br>
Where you'ld not see a wrinkle.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>                     And he knows<br>
The buried water.</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>       There's always buried water,<br>
If you prod deep enough. A dowser finds<br>
Because the whole earth's floating, like a raft.<br>
What does he know? A twitching in his thews;<br>
A dog asleep knows that much. What I know   <br>
I've learnt, and if I'd learnt it wrong, I'ld starve.<br>
And if I'm right about the grubbing moles,<br>
Won't I be right for news of walking men?</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>Of course you're right. Let's put the whole thing by,<br>
And have a pleasant drink.</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale (to Mrs HUFF):</i>

<blockquote>You must be tired<br>
With all this story. Shall we be off for home?</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>You brass! You don't go now with her! She's mine:<br>
You gave her up.</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>And you made nothing of her.</blockquote><br>

<i>(To Mrs Huff) </i><br>
<br>


  <blockquote>Come on.</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff: </i>

<blockquote>Warp, will you do a thing for me?</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp: </i>

<blockquote>A hundred things.</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Then slap me these cur-dogs.</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>I will. Where will I slap them, and which first?</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Maybe 'twill do if you but laugh at them.</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>I'll try for that; but they are not good jokes;<br>
Though there's a kind of monkey-look about them.</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

<blockquote>They thinking I'ld be near one or the other<br>
After this night! Will I be made no more<br>
Than clay that children puddle to their minds,<br>
Moulding it what they fancy? &mdash; Shale was brave:<br>
He made a bogy and defied it, till<br>
He frightened of his work and ran away.<br>
But Huff! &mdash; Huff was for modelling wickedly.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff: </i>

<blockquote>Who told you that?</blockquote><br>

<i>Mrs Huff:</i>

  <blockquote>       I need no one's telling.<br>
I was your wife once. Don't I know your goodness?<br>
A stupid heart gone sour with jealousy,<br>
To feel its blood too dull and thick for sinning. &mdash; <br>
Yes, Huff would figure a wicked thought, but had<br>
No notion how, and flung the clay aside. &mdash; <br>
O they were gaudy colours both! But now<br>
Fear has bleacht their swagger and left them blank,<br>
Fear of a loon that cried, End of the World!</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff: </i>

<blockquote>Shale, do you know what we're to do?</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>                       I'ld like<br>
To have the handling of that dowser-man</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Just that, my lad, just that!</blockquote><br>

<i>Warp:</i>

<blockquote>And your fired rick.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>Let it be blazes! Quick, Shale, after him!  <br>
I'll tramp the night out, but I'll take the rogue. </blockquote><br>

<i>Shale (to the others):</i>

<blockquote>You wait, and see us haul him by the ears,<br>
And swim the blatherer in Huff's farm-yard pond.</blockquote><br>

<i>As HUFF and SHALE go out, they see the comet before them.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Huff: </i>

<blockquote>The devil's own star is that!</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>                       And floats as calm<br>
As a pike basking.</blockquote><br>

<i>Huff:</i>

<blockquote>There shouldn't be such stars!</blockquote><br>

<i>Shale:</i>

<blockquote>Neither such dowsers, and we'll learn him that.</blockquote><br>

<i>They go off together.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Sollers: </i>

<blockquote>Why, the star's dwindling now, surely!</blockquote><br>

<i>Merrick:</i>

<blockquote>                          O, small<br>
  And dull now to the glowing size it was.</blockquote><br>

<i>Vine:</i>

<blockquote>But is it certain there'll be nothing smasht?<br>
Not even a house knockt roaring down in crumbles?<br>
 &mdash; And I did think, I'ld open my wife's mouth<br>
With envy of the dreadful things I'd seen!</blockquote><br>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
