<h1>Security in Your Old Age</h1>

<h3>Social Security Board</h3>
<h4>Washington, D.C.</h4>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-variant: normal;font-style: italics"><i>To Employees of Industrial<br />
and Business Establishments</i></h1>

<h2>FACTORIES &middot; SHOPS &middot; MINES &middot; MILLS &middot; STORES<br />
OFFICES AND OTHER PLACES OF BUSINESS</h2>

<p><i>Beginning November 24, 1936, the United States Government
will set up a Social Security account for you, if you
are eligible. To understand your obligations, rights, arid
benefits you should read the following general explanation</i>.</p>

<p>There is now a law in this country which will give about 26
million working people something to live on when they are
old and have stopped working. This law, which gives other benefits,
too, was passed last year by Congress and is called the Social
Security Act.</p>

<p>Under this law the United States Government will send checks
every month to retired workers, both men and women, after they
have passed their 65th birthday and have met a few simple requirements
of the law.</p>

<h2>WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU</h2>

<p>This means that if you work in some factory, shop, mine, mill,
J. store, office, or almost any other kind of business or industry,
you will be earning benefits that will come to you later on. From
the time you are 65 years old, or more, and stop working, you will
get a Government check every month of your life, if you have
worked some time,(one day or more) in each of any 5 years after
1936, and have earned during that time a total of $2,000 or more.</p>

<p>The checks will come to you as a right. You will get them
regardless of the amount of property or income you may have.
They are what the law calls "Old-Age Benefits" under the Social
Security Act. If you prefer to keep on working after you are 65,
the monthly checks from the Government will begin coming to
you whenever you decide to retire.</p>

The Amount of Your Checks

<p>How much you will get when you are 65 years old will depend
entirely on how much you earn in wages from your industrial or
business employment between January 1, 1937, and your 65th birthday.
A man or woman who gets good wages and has a steady job
most of his or her life can get as much as $85 a month for life after
age 65. The least you can get in monthly benefits, if you come
under the law at all, is $10 a month.</p>

<h3 align="left">IF YOU ARE NOW YOUNG</h3>

<p>Suppose you are making $25 a week and are young enough now to
go on working for 40 years. If you make an average of $25 a week
for 52 weeks in each year, your check when you are 65 years old
will be $53 a month for the rest of your life. If you make $50 a
week, you will get $74.50 a month for the rest of you life after
age 65.</p>

<h3 align="left">IF YOU ARE NOW MIDDLE-AGED</h3>

<p>But suppose you are about 55 years old now and have 10 years to
work before you are 65. Suppose you make only $15 a week on
the average. When you stop work at age 65 you will get a check
for $19 each month for the rest of your life. If you make $25 a
week for 10 years, you will get a little over $23 a month from the
Government as long as you live after your 65th birthday.</p>

<h3 align="left">IF YOU SHOULD DIE BEFORE AGE 65</h3>

<p>If you should die before you begin to get your monthly checks,
your family will get a payment in cash, amounting to 3&frac12; cents on
every dollar of wages you have earned after 1936. If, for example,
you should die at age 64, and if you had earned $25 a week for 10
years before that time, your family would receive $455. On the
other hand, if you have not worked enough to get the regular
monthly checks by the time you are 65, you will get a lump sum,
or if you should die your family or estate would get a lump sum.
The amount of this, too, will be 3&frac12; cents on every dollar of wages
you earn after 1936.</p>

<h2>Taxes</h2>

<p>The same law that provides these old-age benefits for you and
other workers, sets up certain new taxes to be paid to the United
States Government. These taxes are collected by the Bureau of
Internal Revenue of the U. S. Treasury Department, and inquiries
concerning them should be addressed to that bureau. The law also
creates an "Old-Age Reserve Account" in the United States Treasury,
and Congress is authorized to put into this reserve account
each year enough money to provide for the monthly payments you
and other workers are to receive when you are 65.</p>

<h3 align="left">YOUR PART OF THE TAX</h3>

<p>The taxes called for in this law will be paid both by your employer
and by you. For the next 3 years you will pay maybe 15
cents a week, maybe 25 cents a week, maybe 30 cents or more, according
to what you earn. That is to say, during the next 3 years,
beginning January 1, 1937, you will pay 1 cent for every dollar
you earn, and at the same time your employer will pay 1 cent for
every dollar you earn, up to $3,000 a year. Twenty-six million
other workers and their employers will be paying at the same time.</p>

<p>After the first 3 years--that is to say, beginning in 1940--you will,
pay, and your employer will pay, 1&frac12; cents for each dollar you earn,
up to $3,000 a year. This will be the tax for 3 years, and then,
beginning in 1943, you will pay 2 cents, and so will your employer,
for every dollar you earn for the next 3 years. After that, you and
your employer will each pay half a cent more for 3 years, and
finally, beginning in 1949, twelve years from now, you and your
employer will each pay 3 cents on each dollar you earn, up to $3,000
a year. That is the most you will ever pay.</p>

<h3 align="left">YOUR EMPLOYER'S PART OF THE TAX</h3>

<p>The Government will collect both of these taxes from your employer.
Your part of the tax will be taken out of your pay.
The Government will collect from your employer an equal amount
out of his own funds.</p>

<p>This will go on just the same if you go to work for another employer,
so long as you work in a factory, shop, mine, mill, office,
store, or other such place of business. (Wages earned in employment
as farm workers, domestic workers in private homes, Government
workers, and on a few other kinds of jobs are not subject to
this tax.)</p>

<h3 align="left">OLD-AGE RESERVE ACCOUNT</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, the Old-Age Reserve fund in the United States Treasury
is drawing interest, and the Government guarantees it will
never earn less than 3 percent. This means that 3 cents will be
added to every dollar in the fund each year.</p>

<p>Maybe your employer has an old-age pension plan for his employees.
If so, the Government's old-age benefit plan will not have
to interfere with that. The employer can fit his plan into the Government
plan.</p>

<p>What you get from the Government plan will always be more
than you have paid in taxes and usually more than you can get
for yourself by putting away the same amount of money each week
in some other way.</p>

wages and employment as defined in the Social Security Act</i>.</p>

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Security in Your Old Age
(Informational Service Circular No. 9), by Social Security Board

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SECURITY IN YOUR OLD AGE ***

This file should be named 8sosc10h.htm or 8sosc10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8sosc11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8sosc10ah.htm

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
