      FOREWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Liberty, Equality and Fraternity have been preached through
      all time but it was left for William Penn, the Quaker, to
      come nearer establishing the ideal of this Trinity than any
      other being called Human before or since his day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be argued that more was due to the Faith he held than
      to the Man. Yet this must be answered that it took some more
      than ordinary Man to absorb and fulfill the requirements of
      such a Faith. There have been many Quakers and but one Penn!
    </p>
    <p>
      Born on the 15th of October, 1644, in the angry days of the
      Roundhead Revolt, his early years were spent in an intensely
      religious atmosphere that saturated his soul, but at the same
      time bred detestation of bigotry and persecution. If he
      seemed to be performing out of his class because of his
      family's eminence, it should be recalled that this was
      acquired, not inherited. His father, Admiral Sir William
      Penn, was the son of Giles Penn, a merchant navigator trading
      into the Mediterranean, and his wife Margaret Jasper,
      daughter of Hans Jasper, a sea trader of Rotterdam: From
      these forbears the youth received independence of thought and
      firmness of mind. He was therefore less of an anomaly than he
      appeared to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rigid religious rule of Cromwell, under which he had
      spent his youthful years, had passed and in its stead befell
      a period of loose living and easy ways. Puritanism, though
      speaking and acting in the name of Liberty, possessed but
      little of that quality either for mind or body. In setting up
      for the great cause he fared as well, or better, with all his
      persecutions, than did his Quaker brethren in that New
      England which had been founded for opinion's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering Oxford at fifteen the boy soon fell under the
      influence of Thomas Loe, a preacher of Quaker doctrine and
      became imbued with his teachings. This clashed at once with
      his surroundings and the College requirements. He refused to
      attend chapel or to wear the customary gown, deeming it a
      sort of surplice. A little group of students who had accepted
      Loe's principles joined him in this obduracy, going so far as
      to strip the gowns from the persons of willing wearers. This
      led to his expulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel Pepys mentions him in his diary on October 31st, 1661,
      as having "but come from Oxford" and meeting his father at
      Pepys' house. On the 25th of January, 1662, the Admiral
      discussed with Pepys a plan for sending his son to Cambridge
      or some private college. Pepys undertook to write Dr.
      Fairbrother and inquire into the merits of Hezekiah Burton at
      Magdalen, as an instructor for the difficult youth. It was
      impossible to fit him into any school under the dominion of
      the Church of England and in wrath his father forbade him the
      house. His mother interceded, with the result that he was
      sent to Europe for the grand tour, presumably with outward
      success, for on August 6, 1664, Mrs. Pepys informs Samuel
      that "Mr. Pen, Sir William's son, is come back from France
      and come to visit her. A most modish person, grown, she says,
      a fine gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner on the 30th of the same month "comes Mr. Pen to
      visit me, and staid an hour talking with me. I perceive
      something of learning he has got, but a great deal, if not
      too much of the vanity of the French garb and affected manner
      of speech and gait. I fear all real profit he hath made of
      his travel will signify little."
    </p>
    <p>
      The home coming soon stripped Penn of the "vanity of the
      French garb," and he became once more a problem. He tried the
      study of law, but could not interest himself in it. To keep
      him out of the way and repress his dangerous thoughts he was
      given the management in 1665, of an estate owned by the
      Admiral in Ireland, where he went and did as he pleased,
      falling in again with Thomas Loe and resuming his Quaker
      views. December 29th, 1667, Pepys records a call from Mrs.
      Turner "...and there, among other talk, she tells me that Mr.
      William Pen, who is lately come over from Ireland, is a
      Quaker again, or some very melancholy thing; that he cares
      for no company, nor comes into any; which is a pleasant
      thing, after his being abroad so long, and his father such a
      hypocritical rogue and at this time an Atheist."
    </p>
    <p>
      This return he signalized by intense activity in pressing
      Quakerism upon the public, to the vexation of his father who
      was one of the notables of England, as Admiral both under
      Cromwell and the King. He had commanded the fleet of the Lord
      Protector which wrested the rich Island of Jamaica from Spain
      and as one of the three commissioners of the Navy, laid the
      foundation for that British fleet which has ever since played
      so large a part in the history of the world. He was the
      practical man of the commission, from whom James, Duke of
      York, afterwards, and very briefly King, took most of his
      advice. He reformed the higgledy-piggledy naval tactics of
      the time and taught the commanders to attack the enemy in
      line, the most important change in the sea annals of his
      country. Knighted in 1665 for service against the Dutch he
      failed of the peerage because of the public prejudice against
      his son, which deterred the King from giving him an honor as
      high as he deserved. As Clerk of the Acts, Pepys was much in
      contact with him socially and officially. The famous diary
      teems with references, many of them convivial, others most
      unkind. He was faithful to the commonwealth as long as it was
      faithful to itself. Perceiving that it could not hold
      together after the death of Cromwell he joined with George
      Monk in bringing about the restoration of the Stuarts,
    </p>
    <p>
      Against this background of paternal distinction, the young
      reformer shone invidiously and brought his father great
      chagrin by his association with carpenters and weavers in
      their non-conformist agitations. He preached in poor halls
      and in the streets. The newspaper, not having arrived, he
      took to pamphleteering to spread his doctrines. This activity
      reached a crisis in 1669. Writing in his diary under date of
      February 12, 1669, Pepys says: "...Felling hath got me W.
      Pen's book against the Trinity. I got my wife to read it to
      me; and I find it so well writ as, I think, it is too good
      for him ever to have writ it, and it is a serious sort of
      book not fit for everybody to read."
    </p>
    <p>
      The extended title of this work was "The Sandy Foundation
      Shaken&#8212;or those ...Doctrines of one God subsisting in
      three distinct and separate persons; the impossibility of
      God's pardoning persons by an imputative refuted from the
      authority of scripture testimonies and right reason," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a drastic review of the doctrine of the Trinity and as
      the title implies, undertook to prove that the majestic
      edifice of the State Church was not founded upon a rock. It
      created much excitement and speedily landed its author in the
      Tower. Here he remained nine months, unrepentant and writing
      more pious sedition, to wit: "No Cross No Crown," and
      "Innocency With Her Open Face." These were further polemics
      against Episcopacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King having no heart for persecution, and the Duke of
      York, who was a firm friend, contrived to have the prisoner
      released on the 4th of August and turned over to his father
      to be transported to some spot where he would be less
      troublesome. This plan was not seriously carried out. Indeed
      the Admiral's days were numbered. He died after a year's
      illness, on the 16th of September, 1670.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penn's prominence and influence increased with the death of
      his father. It was plain that no ordinary mind directed his
      actions. Respect followed. He took much part in public
      matters and as umpire in a dispute between Fenwick and
      Byllinge, two Quakers, over some land rights in New Jersey,
      he developed an interest in the New World and planned to
      found in it a place of refuge for those persecuted in Old and
      New England for opinion's sake. This desire was readily
      carried out. By fortunate chance the Crown owed Admiral
      Penn's estate some $80,000. To pay this debt and be rid of an
      agitator, the shrewd King made an easy adjustment in 1681 by
      handing over to the heir a vast province between the Delaware
      and the Ohio, in return for an annual tribute of two beaver
      skins, to be paid for ninety-nine years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the idealist created his elysium and came as close to
      making one as the curious animal he sought to benefit would
      permit. The King set forth in writing the Grant that it was
      due "the memory and merits of Sir William Penn in divers
      services, and particularly his conduct, courage and
      discretion under our dearest brother, James, Duke of York, in
      that signal battle and victory fought and obtained against
      the Dutch fleet commanded by the Heer Van Opdam, in 1665."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to be outdone by his Royal brother, James threw in the
      Province of Delaware to which he held the fee, "out of a
      special regard to the memory and many faithful and eminent
      services heretofore performed by the said Sir William Penn to
      his Majesty and Royal Highness." This under date of August
      21st, 1682.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Penn's purpose to call his Paradise Sylvania, because
      of its wooded vales, but the King, with his obligation to the
      Admiral well in mind neatly prefixed "Penn" to the fanciful
      selection and it became justly and rightly "Pennsylvania" not
      in memory of William, but of his valiant father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles II was an able politician and understood human
      nature. Often accused of ingratitude and seldom deserving the
      charge, with a willingness to perform a good action as
      readily as a bad one, he acted perhaps in languid memory of
      the mistake made by his heedless father when he stayed the
      departure of Cromwell for the New World, where he had
      resolved to go "and never see England
      more,"&#8212;determining that there should be no repetition
      of history so far as he was concerned by repressing a zealot
      in narrow quarters near home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Charles for once at least, belied the couplet scrawled
      upon his chamber door by the ribald Earl of Rochester:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Here lies our sovereign lord the King<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose word no man relies on;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; He never says a foolish thing<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ever does a wise one.<br>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      His sayings, Charles aptly replied, were his own; his acts
      those of his ministers. He ordered well indeed when he placed
      Penn where he did in the New World and he meant wisely when
      he decreed that the red races should possess, free and
      forever, the lands beyond the Alleghanies. With Penn's
      venture we need have no more to do than to recall that so
      long as his control lasted or his wishes extended, the
      Pennsylvania Indians and their cousins of New York and Ohio,
      were at peace with the whites; that his words and those of
      his agents were trusted; that Pennsylvania sheltered the
      persecuted Palatines and that the Liberty Bell first rang in
      the city he had named Philadelphia&#8212;the City of
      Brotherly Love!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Trial here recited began in London, on the first of
      September, 1670, a fortnight before his father's death, while
      the disturbance of which it was the outgrowth, occurred on
      the fourth of August preceding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text is repeated from the report embedded in the second
      volume of the four great folios, comprising "A Compleat
      Collection of State Tryals," covering the period of English
      justice and injustice from the reign of King Henry the Fourth
      to the end of that of Anne, printed for six venturesome
      London booksellers, Timothy Goodwin, John Walthoe, Benjamin
      Tooke, John Darby, Jacob Tonson, and John Walthoe, Junior, in
      1719, where is found this first record of a legal effort to
      punish free speech among the English race&#8212;and by the
      same token to vindicate it. Reported by the accused, it no
      less reads fair. The "Observer" whose comments interlard and
      conclude the "Tryal" was Penn. It was a rare proceeding in
      which both prisoners and jury ended up in jail for their
      obduracy in maintaining that right to speak as we may, which
      is still one of the most difficult to maintain, and yet
      remains the foundation of human liberty.

    </p>
    <p>
      OBSERV. The said Prisoners were brought, but were set aside,
      and other Business prosecuted. Where we cannot choose but
      observe, that it was the constant and unkind Practices of the
      Court to the Prisoners, to make them wait upon the Trials of
      Felons and Murderers, thereby designing, in all probability,
      both to affront and tire them.

      Hats upon their Heads (pursuant to the Order of the Court)

      RECORD. Well, the Court sets forty Marks a piece upon your
      Heads, as a Fine for your Contempt of the Court.
    </p>

      PEN. I desire it might be observed, that we came into the
      Court with our Hats off (that is, taken off) and if they have
      been put on since, it was by Order from the Bench; and
      therefore not we, but the Bench should be fined.

      MEAD. I desire the Jury, and all People to take notice of
      this Injustice of the Recorder; who spake to me to pull off

      Holy Spirit, for he is not far from every one of you.

      COOK. I was sent for, from the <i>Exchange</i>, to go and
      disperse a Meeting in <i>Gracechurch-Street</i>, where I saw
      <i>Mr. Penn</i> speaking to the People, but I could not hear
      what he said, because of the Noise; I endeavoured to make way
      to take him, but I could not get to him for the Crowd of
      People; upon which <i>Capt. Mead</i> came to me, about the
      Kennel of the Street, and desired me to let him go on; for
      when he had done, he would bring <i>Mr. Penn</i> to me.

      Preach, and yet faith, he doth not know what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jury, take notice, he swears now a clean contrary thing to
      what he swore before the Mayor when we were committed: For
      now he swears that he saw me in <i>Gracechurch-Street</i>,
      and yet swore before the Mayor, when I was committed, that he
      did not see me there. I appeal to the Mayor himself, if this
      be not true. But no Answer was given.

      impossible for the Jury to determine, or agree to bring in

      self, is now concerned: You are many Mouths and Ears against
      me, and if I must not be allowed to make the best of my Case,
      it is hard. I say again, unless you shew me, and the People,
      the Law you ground your Indictment upon, I shall take it for
      granted your Proceedings are meerly Arbitrary.

      Indictment, but whether this Indictment be legal. It is too
      general and imperfect an Answer, to say it is the Common Law,
      unless we knew both where, and what it is: For where there is
      no Law, there is no Transgression; and that Law which is not
      in being, is so far from being Common, that it is no Law at
      all.

    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. Sirrah, you are an impudent Fellow, I will put a Mark
      upon you.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. They used much menacing Language, and behaved
      themselves very imperiously to the Jury, as Persons not more
      void of Justice than sober Education: After this barbarous
      Usage, they sent them to consider of bringing in their
      Verdict, and after some considerable time they returned to
      the Court. Silence was call'd for, and the Jury call'd by
      their Names.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLER. Are you agreed upon your Verdict?
    </p>
    <p>
      JURY. Yes.

    <p>
      CLER. Who shall speak for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JURY. Our Fore-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLER. Look upon the Prisoners at the Bar. How say you? Is
      <i>William Penn</i> Guilty of the Matter whereof he stands
      indicted in Manner and Form, or Not Guilty?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-M. Guilty of Speaking in Gracechurch-Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      COURT. Is that all?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-M. That is all I have in Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. You had as good say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. Was it not an unlawful Assembly? You mean he was
      speaking to a Tumult of People there?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-M. My Lord, This is all I had in Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. Here some of the Jury seemed to buckle to the
      Questions of the Court; upon which, <i>Bushel, Hammond</i>,
      and some others, opposed themselves, and said, they allowed
      of no such Word, as an unlawful Assembly in their Verdict; at
      which the Recorder, Mayor, <i>Robinson</i> and
      <i>Bloodworth</i> took great occasion to villifie them with
      most opprobrious Language; and this Verdict not serving their
      Turns, the Recorder express'd himself thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      REG. The Law of <i>England</i> will not allow you to part
      till you have given in your Verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      JURY. We have given in our Verdict, and we can give in no
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. Gentlemen, you have not given in your Verdict, and you
      had as good say nothing; therefore go and consider it once
      more, that we may make an end of this troublesome Business.
    </p>
    <p>
      JURY. We desire we may have Pen, Ink and Paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. The Court adjourn'd for half an Hour; which being
      expired, the Court returns, and the Jury not long after.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prisoners were brought to the Bar, and the Jury's Names
      called over.

    <p>
      JUR. Our Fore-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLER. What say you, look upon the Prisoners: Is <i>William
      Penn</i> Guilty in Manner and Form, as he stands indicted, or
      Not Guilty?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-M. Here is our Verdict, holding forth a piece of Paper
      to the Clerk of the Peace, which follows;
    </p>
    <p>
      We <i>the Jurors, hereafter named, do find</i> William Penn
      <i>to be Guilty of Speaking or Preaching to an Assembly, met
      together in</i> Gracechurch-Street, <i>the 14th of August
      last, 1670</i>. <i>And that</i> William Mead is <i>Not guilty
      of the said Indictment</i>.

      OBSER. This both Mayor and Recorder resented as so high a
      rate, that they exceeded the Bounds of all Reason and
      Civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. What will you be led by such a silly Fellow as
      <i>Bushel</i>? an impudent canting Fellow? I warrant you, you
      shall come no more upon Juries in haste: You are a Fore-man
      indeed, addressing himself to the Fore-man, I thought you had
      understood your Place better.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. Gentlemen, you shall not be dismist till we have a
      Verdict, that the Court will accept; and you shall be lock'd
      up, without Meat, Drink, Fire, and Tobacco; you shall not
      think thus to abuse the Court; we will have a Verdict, by the
      help of God, or you shall starve for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEN. My Jury, who are my Judges, ought not to be thus
      menaced; their Verdict should be free, and not compelled; the
      Bench ought to wait upon them, but not forestall them. I do
      desire that Justice may be done me, and that the Arbitrary
      Resolves of the Bench may not be made the Measure of my
      Jury's Verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. Stop that prating Fellow's Mouth, or put him out of the
      Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. You have heard that he preach'd, that he gathered a
      Company of tumultuous People, and that they do not only
      disobey the Martial Power, but Civil also.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEN. It is a great Mistake; we did not make the Tumult, but
      they that interrupted us: The Jury cannot be so ignorant, as
      to think, that we met there, with a Design to disturb the
      Civil Peace, since (1st.) we were by Force of Arms kept out
      of our lawful House, and met as near it in the Street, as
      their soldiers would give us leave; and (2dly.) because it
      was no new thing (nor with the Circumstances expres'd in the
      Indictment) but what was usual and customary with us; 'tis
      very well known that we are a peaceable People, and cannot
      offer Violence to any Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. The Court being ready to break up, and willing to
      huddle the Prisoners to their Goal, and the Jury to their
      Chamber, Penn spoke as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      PEN. The Agreement of Twelve Men is a Verdict in Law, and
      such a one being given by the Jury, I require the Clerk of
      the Peace to record it, as he will answer it at his Peril.
      And if the Jury bring in another Verdict contradictory to
      this, I affirm they are perjur'd Men in Law. And looking upon
      the Jury, said, You are <i>Englishmen</i>, mind your
      Privilege, give not away your Right.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUSH. &amp;c. Nor will we ever do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. One of the Jury-men pleaded Indisposition of Body, and
      therefore desired to be dismist.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. You are as strong as any of them; starve with them; and
      hold your Principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. Gentlemen, You must be contented with your hard Fate,
      let your Patience overcome it; for the Court is resolved to
      have a Verdict, and that before you can be dismist.
    </p>
    <p>
      JURY. We are agreed, we are agreed, we are agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. The Court swore several Persons, to keep the Jury all
      Night without Meat, Drink, Fire, or any other Accommodation;
      they had not so much as a Chamberpot, tho' desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRY. O Yes, <i>&amp;c.</i>

    <p>
      OBSER. The Court adjourns till Seven of the Clock next
      Morning (being the 4th Instant, vulgarly call'd Sunday) at
      which time the Prisoners were brought to the Bar: The Court
      sat, and the Jury called to bring in their Verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRY. O Yes, <i>&amp;c.</i> &#8212;&#8212; Silence in the
      Court, upon pain of Imprisonment.

      William Penn Guilty of the Matter whereof he stands indicted,
      in Manner and Form as aforesaid, or Not guilty?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-M. <i>William Penn</i> is guilty of Speaking in
      <i>Gracechurch-Street</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. To an unlawful Assembly?

      last Night; we have no other Verdict to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. You are a factious Fellow, I'll take a Course with you.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      BUSH. Sir <i>Thomas</i> I have done according to my
      Conscience.
    </p>

      BUSH. No, my Lord, it never shall.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. But I will cut yours so soon as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      REG. He has inspired the Jury; he has the Spirit of
      Divination, methinks I feel him. I will have a positive
      Verdict, or you shall starve for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEN. I desire to ask the Recorder one Question, Do you allow
      of the Verdict given of <i>William Mead</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. It cannot be a Verdict, because you were indicted for a
      Conspiracy, and one being found Not guilty, and not the
      other, it could not be a Verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEN. If Not guilty be not a Verdict, then you make of the
      Jury and <i>Magna Charta</i> but a meer Nose of Wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      MEAD. How! is Not guilty no Verdict?
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. No, 'tis no Verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEN. I affirm, that the Consent of a Jury is a Verdict in
      Law; and if <i>William Mead</i> be Not guilty, it
      consequently follows, that I am clear, since you have
      indicted us of a Conspiracy, and I could not possibly
      conspire alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. There were many Passages, that could not be taken,
      which past between the Jury and the Court. The Jury went up
      again, having received a fresh Charge from the Bench, if
      possible to extort an unjust Verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      CRY. O Yes, <i>&amp;c</i>. Silence in the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      COUR. Call over the Jury. Which was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLER. What say you? Is <i>William Penn</i> Guilty of the
      Matter whereof he stands indicted, in Manner and Form
      aforesaid, or Not Guilty?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-MAN. Guilty of speaking in <i>Gracechurch-Street</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. What is this to the Purpose? I say, I will have a
      Verdict. And speaking to <i>Edw. Bushel</i>, said, You are a
      factious Fellow; I will set a Mark upon you; and whilst I
      have anything to do in the City, I will have an eye upon you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. Have you no more Wit than to be led by such a pitiful
      Fellow? I will cut his Nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEN. It is intolerable that my Jury should be thus menaced:
      Is this according to the Fundamental Laws? Are not they my
      proper Judges by the great Charter of <i>England</i>? What
      hope is there of ever having Justice done, when Juries are
      threatened, and their Verdicts rejected? I am concerned to
      speak and grieved to see such Arbitrary Proceedings. Did not
      the Lieutenant of the Tower render one of them worse than a
      Felon? And do you not plainly seem to condemn such for
      factious Fellows, who answer not your Ends? Unhappy are those
      Juries, who are threatened to be fined, and starved, and
      ruined, if they give not in Verdicts contrary to their
      Consciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. My Lord, you must take a Course with that same Fellow.
    </p>

      MAY. Stop his Mouth; Jaylor, bring Fetters, and stake him to
      the Ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      PEN. Do your Pleasure, I matter not your Fetters.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. Till now I never understood the Reason of the Policy and
      Prudence of the <i>Spaniards</i>, in suffering the
      Inquisition among them: And certainly it will never be well
      with us, till something like unto the <i>Spanish</i>
      Inquisition be in <i>England</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. The Jury being required to go together to find another
      Verdict, and steadfastly refusing it (saying they could give
      no other Verdict than what was already given) the Recorder in
      great Passion was running off the Bench, with these Words in
      his Mouth, <i>I protest I will sit here no longer to hear
      these Things</i>; at which the Mayor calling, <i>Stay,
      stay</i>, he returned, and directed himself unto the Jury,
      and spoke as followeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. Gentlemen, we shall not be at this trade always with
      you; you will find the next Sessions of Parliament there will
      be a Law made, that those that will not conform shall not
      have the Protection of the Law. Mr. <i>Lee</i>, draw up
      another Verdict, that they may bring it in special.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEE. I cannot tell how to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JUR. We ought not to be return'd, having all agreed, and set
      our Hands to the Verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      REC. Your Verdict is nothing, you play upon the Court; I say
      you shall go together, and bring in another Verdict, or you
      shall starve; and I will have you charted about the City, as
      in Edward the Third's time.
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-M. We have given in our Verdict, and all agreed to it;
      and if we give in another, it will be a Force upon us to save
      our Lives.

      to make you go.

      Morning, at seven of the Clock.

      remained till next Morning, and then were brought unto the

    <p>
      CRY. O yes, <i>&amp;c</i>. Silence in the Court, upon pain of

    </p>
    <p>
      JUR. Our Fore-man.

      Manner and form, &amp;c., or Not Guilty?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-MAN. Here is our Verdict in Writing, and our Hands
      subscribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. The Clerk took the paper, but was stopt by the
      Recorder from reading of it; and he commanded to ask for a
      positive Verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-MAN. That is our Verdict; we have subscribed to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLER. How say you? Is William Penn Guilty, &amp;c., or Not
      Guilty?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-MAN. Not guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLER. How say you? Is William Mead Guilty, &amp;c., or Not
      Guilty?
    </p>
    <p>
      FORE-MAN. Not guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLER. Then hearken to your Verdict; you say that William Penn
      is Not Guilty in Manner and Form as he stands indicted; you
      say that <i>William Mead</i> is Not guilty in Manner and Form
      as he stands indicted, and so you say all?
    </p>
    <p>
      JUR. Yes, we do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBSER. The Bench being unsatisfied with the Verdict,
      commanded that every Person should distinctly answer to their
      Names, and give in their Verdict, which they unanimously did,
      in saying, Not Guilty, to the great Satisfaction of the
      Assembly.

      Judgments and Opinions, rather than the good and wholsome
      Advice, which was given you; God keep my Life out of your
      Hands; but for this the Court Fines you forty Mark a Man; and
      Imprisonment till paid. At which <i>Penn</i> stept up towards
      the Bench, and said:

    </p>
    <p>
      MAY. For contempt of the Court.

    <p>
      PEN. I ask, if it be according to the Fundamental Laws of
      <i>England</i>, that any English-Man should be Fined or
      Amerced, but by the Judgment of his Peers or Jury; since it
      expressly contradicts the fourteenth and twenty-ninth Chap.
      of the great Charter of <i>England</i>, which say, No
      Free-Man ought to be amerced, but by the Oath of good and
      Lawful Men of the Vicinage.

      wonder, <i>Since the Spanish Inquisition hath so great a
      place in the Recorder's Heart</i>. God Almighty, who is just,
      will judge you all for these things.

      So ended the "Tryal." The contumacious jurors did not long
      remain in duress. The pertinacious Bushel, being a man of
      substance, took steps to legally rescue himself and fellows,
      and soon succeeded. The affair had an important after echo at
      the trial in New York, of John Peter Zenger, the Palatine
      Printer, in 1735, for libelling Governor William Cosby, by
      telling the truth about his infringement of popular liberty,
      when the attempted forcing of the Penn jury was powerfully
      employed by Andrew Hamilton, attorney for the defense, to
      curb the efforts of Mr. Justice De Lancey to coerce the
      twelve. In his remarkable address&#8212;an address that
      solidified the foundation for liberty of the press and free
      speech on this continent and was a worthy preface to the
      Declaration of Independence drawn some forty years
      later&#8212;Hamilton said, concerning this "Tryal":
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. <i>Penn</i> and <i>Mead</i> being Quakers, and having
      met in a peaceable Manner, after being shut out of their
      Meeting House, preached in Grace Church Street, in London, to
      the People of their own Perswasion, and for this they were
      indicted; and it was said, <i>That they with other Persons,
      to the Number of 300. unlawfully and tumultuously assembled,
      to the Disturbance of the Peace, &amp;c</i>. To which they
      pleaded <i>Not Guilty</i>. And the Petit Jury being sworn to
      try the Issue between the King and the Prisoners, that is,
      whether they were Guilty, according to the Form of the
      Indictment? Here there was no Dispute but they were assembled
      together, to the Number mentioned in the Indictment; But
      <i>Whether that Meeting together was riotously, tumultuously,
      and to the Disturbance of the Peace</i>? was the Question.
      And the Court told the Jury it was, and ordered the Jury to
      find it so; <i>For</i> (said the Court) <i>the Meeting was
      the Matter of Fact, and that is confessed, and we tell you it
      is unlawful, for it is against the Statute; and the Meeting
      being unlawful, it follows of Course that it was tumultuous,
      and to the Disturbance of the Peace</i>. But the Jury did not
      think fit to take the Court's Word for it, for they could
      neither find <i>Riot, Tumult</i>, or any Thing tending to the
      <i>Breach of the Peace</i> committed at that Meeting; and
      they acquitted Mr. <i>Penn</i> and <i>Mead</i>. In doing of
      which they took upon them to judge both the <i>Law</i> and
      the <i>Fact</i>, at which the Court (being themselves true
      Cortiers) were so much offended, that they fined the Jury 40
      Marks a piece, and committed them till paid. But Mr.
      <i>Bushel</i>, who valued the Right of a Juryman and the
      Liberty of his Country more than his own, refused to pay the
      Fine, and was resolved (tho' at a great Expence and trouble
      too) to bring, and did bring, his <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, to be
      relieved from his Fine and Imprisonment, and he was released
      accordingly; and this being the Judgment in his Case, it is
      established for Law, <i>That the Judges, how great soever
      they be, have no Right to Fine, imprison, or punish a Jury,
      for not finding a Verdict according to the Direction of the
      Court</i>. And this I hope is sufficient to prove, That
      Jurymen are to see with their own Eyes, to hear with their
      own Ears, and to make use of their own Consciences and the
      Understandings, in judging of the Lives, Liberties or Estates
      of their Fellow Subjects."

This file should be named twpwm10h.htm or twpwm10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, twpwm11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, twpwm10ah.htm


Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or
<a href="http://promo.net.pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
