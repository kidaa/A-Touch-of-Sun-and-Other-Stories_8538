<h1>Mr. Pim Passes By</h1>




<h1>Act I</h1>



<p><i>The morning-room at Marden House (Buckinghamshire) decided more than
a hundred years ago that it was all right, and has not bothered about
itself since. Visitors to the house have called the result such
different adjectives as "mellow," "old-fashioned," "charming"&ndash;even
"baronial" and "antique;" but nobody ever said it was "exciting."
Sometimes</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>wants it to be more exciting, and last week she
rather let herself go over some new curtains; she still has the rings
to put on. It is obvious that the curtains alone will overdo the
excitement; they will have to be harmonized with a new carpet and
cushions.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>has her eye on just the things, but one has to
go carefully with</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>. <i>What was good enough, for his great-great-grandfather is good enough for him. However, we can trust</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>to see him through it, although it may take time.</i></p>

<p><i>A scene plot is given at the end of the play.</i></p>

<p><i>There are three ways of coming into the room: by the open windows
leading from the garden, by the doors to R., or by the staircase from
up</i> R, <span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span> <i>chooses the latter way&ndash;or rather</i> <span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>chooses
it for him; and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span> <i>kindly and inoffensively follows her. She
comes down steps and crosses to</i> C., <i>followed by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> (<i>moves up, looking off</i> L. <i>and returning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>
R.C.). I'll tell Mr. Marden you're here, sir. Mr. Pim, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>nervously</i>). Yes&ndash;er&ndash;Mr. Pim&ndash;Mr. Carraway Pim. He doesn't
know me, you understand, but if he could just spare me a few moments&ndash;er&mdash;(<i>He fumbles in his pockets</i>.) I gave you that letter?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Yes, sir, I'll give it to him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>brings out a stamped letter which is not the one he was looking
for, but which reminds him of something else he has forgotten. Looking
at letter</i>). Oh! Dear me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Yes, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Dear me. I ought to have posted this. (<i>Looking at letter</i>.)
Oh, well, I must send a telegram. You have a telegraph office in the
village?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Oh, yes, sir. (<i>Moving up to terrace up</i> L. <i>and pointing
off</i> L.) If you turn to the left when you get outside the gates,
it's about a hundred yards down the hill. Turn to the left and down the
hill.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Turn to the left and down the hill. Thank you, thank you. Very
stupid of me to have forgotten.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>exits up staircase R</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span> <i>wanders about the room humming to himself, and looking at
the pictures and photos on piano. Then goes out at window up</i> L.)
(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>enters from staircase up</i> R. <i>dancing, and humming the
air of "Down on the Farm:" she is nineteen, very pretty, very happy,
and full of boyish high spirits and conversation. She dances to foot of
stairs, looks off</i> R., <i>then down</i> C., <i>then to piano; sits
and plays a few bars and sings "Down on the Farm," rises and moves up
to</i> R. <i>of piano, and as she does so</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>re-enters from
window up</i> L. <i>and they come suddenly face to face up back</i> C.
<i>below the writing-table. There is a slight pause</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>backing a step</i>). Hullo!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. You must forgive me, but... Good morning, Mrs. Marden.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh, I say, <i>I</i>'m not Mrs. Marden. I'm Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>with a smile</i>). Then I will say, Good morning. Miss Diana.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>). Now, look here, if you and I are going to
be friends, you mustn't do that. Dinah, <i>not</i> Diana. Do remember
it, there's a good man, because I get so tired of correcting people.
(<i>Moving down</i> C. <i>to</i> B.) Have you come to stay with us?
(<i>Sits on settee</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>following her down</i>). Well, no, Miss&ndash;er&ndash;Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>nodding</i>). That's right. I can see I shan't have to speak
to <i>you</i> again. Now tell me your name, and I bet you I get it
right first time. And do sit down.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>crossing to</i> L. <i>and sitting on settee</i> L.). Thank you.
My name is&ndash;er&ndash;Pim, Carraway Pim&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Pim, that's easy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. And I have a letter of introduction to your father&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>rising and crossing to</i> R. <i>of table</i> L.C. <i>and
speaking across same</i>). Oh, no; now you're going wrong again, Mr.
Pim. George isn't my father; he's my uncle. Uncle George&ndash;he doesn't
like me calling him George. Olivia doesn't mind&ndash;I mean she doesn't
mind being called Olivia, but George is rather touchy. (<i>Sitting on
table, facing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>.) You see, he's been my guardian since I was
about two, and then about five years ago he married a widow called Mrs.
Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>repeating</i>). Mrs. Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. That's Olivia&ndash;so she became my Aunt Olivia, only she lets me
drop the Aunt. (<i>Speaking very sharply</i>.) Get that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>a little alarmed</i>). I&ndash;I think so, Miss Marden.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>admiringly</i>). I say, you <i>are</i> quick, Mr. Pim. Well,
if you take my advice, when you've finished your business with George,
you will hang about a bit and see if you can't see Olivia. (<i>Rising
and moving</i> C.) She's simply&ndash;(<i>feeling for the word</i>)&ndash;devastating. I don't wonder George fell in love with her.</p>

<p>(<i>Moving to above piano</i> R., <i>looking at photos, etc.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>rising and looking at his watch and coming</i> C.). It's only
the merest matter of business&ndash;just a few words with your uncle&ndash;Perhaps I'd better...</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>looking at photo on top end of piano</i>). Well, you must
please yourself, Mr. Pim. I'm just giving you a friendly word of
advice. Naturally, I was awfully glad to get such a magnificent aunt.
(<i>Moving down to</i> L. <i>of piano and taking up and looking at
photo of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) Because, after all, marriage <i>is</i> rather a
toss up, isn't it?&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>taken aback</i>). Well, I don't, know, I haven't had any
experience...</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>continuing</i>). And George might have gone off with anybody.
(<i>Moving to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>.) It's different on the stage, where guardians
always marry their wards, but George couldn't marry <i>me</i> because
I'm his niece. Mind you, I don't say that I should have had him,
because, between ourselves, he's a little bit old-fashioned.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. So he married&ndash;er&ndash;Mrs. Marden instead.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Mrs. Telworthy&ndash;don't say you've forgotten already, just when
you were getting so good at names. Mrs. Telworthy. (<i>Moves to and
sits on settee</i> R.) You see, Olivia married the Telworthy man and
went to Australia with him, and he drank himself to death in the bush,
or wherever you drink yourself to death out there, and Olivia came home
to England, and met my uncle, and he fell in love with her and proposed
to her&ndash;(<i>rises and kneels on settee</i>)&ndash;and he came into my room
that night&ndash;I was about fourteen&ndash;and turned on the light and said,
"Dinah, how would you like to have a beautiful aunt of your very own?"
(<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>laughs</i>.) And I said: "Congratulations, George." (<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>
<i>laughs again</i>.) That was the first time I called him George. Of
course, I'd seen it coming for weeks. Telworthy, isn't it a funny name?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, a most curious name&ndash;Telworthy. From Australia, you say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Yes, I always say that he's probably still alive, and will turn
up here one morning and annoy George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>shocked</i>). Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. But I'm afraid there's not much chance.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>shocked</i>). Miss Marden! Really!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>, Well, of course, I don't really <i>want</i> it to happen, but it
<i>would</i> be rather exciting. (<i>Crossing to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>.) Wouldn't it,
Mr Pim?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Exciting!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>crosses to below settee</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. However, things like that never seem to occur down here,
somehow, (<i>Running up into window up</i> R. <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>watches her</i>.)
There was a hayrick burnt last year about a mile away, but that isn't
the same, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No, I should say that that was certainly different.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>coming to back of table</i> L.C.). Of course, something very,
very wonderful did happen last night. (<i>Backing away</i>.) No, no!
I'm not sure if I know you well enough&ndash;(<i>She looks at him
hesitatingly</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). Really, Miss Marden, you mustn't. I am only
a&ndash;a passer-by, here to-day and gone to-morrow. You really mustn't&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>looking round and earning down to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>), And yet there's
something about you, Mr. Pim, which inspires confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>moving to</i> L.). Oh, no. Really, you mustn't tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>taking his arm</i>). The fact is&ndash;(<i>in a stage
whisper</i>)&ndash;I got engaged last night!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Dear me, let me congratulate you. I wish somebody would come here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>running up to foot of staircase up</i> R. <i>and looking
off</i>), I expect that's why George is keeping you such a long time.
(<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>.) Brian, my young man, the well-known painter&ndash;only nobody has ever heard of him&ndash;he's smoking a pipe with George in
the library and asking for his niece's hand. (<i>Coming back to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>, <i>and taking his hands, she dances round with him in a
circle</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>falls exhausted and coughing on to settee</i> L. <i>and</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>laughing sits on settee</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Isn't it exciting? You're really rather lucky, Mr. Pim&ndash;I mean
being told so soon. Even Olivia doesn't know yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Yes, yes, I congratulate you, Miss Marden. Perhaps it would be
better&ndash;(<i>About to get up</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>comes in from staircase up</i> R. <i>She comes to</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Mr. Marden is out at the moment, sir&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>disappointed</i>). Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> (<i>seeing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>). Oh, I didn't see you, Miss Dinah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Out! Eh? Dear! Dear!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>, It's all right, Anne. (<i>Rising</i>.) <i>I'm</i> looking after
Mr. Pim.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Very well, Miss.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>sotto voce</i>). Out! Oh, well, I'd better go&ndash;</p>

<p>(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>up staircase</i> B.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>excitedy</i>). That's me. (<i>Running up to foot of staircase
and watching</i> <span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>off</i>.) They can't discuss me in the library
without breaking down&ndash;(<i>coming down</i> R. <i>and imitating</i>
<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>)&ndash;so they're walking up and down outside, and
slashing at the thistles in order to conceal their emotion. You know. I
expect Brian&ndash;(<i>Crossing up to</i> R. <i>of window</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>rising, calling</i>). Miss Marden! Miss Marden! (<i>Looking at
his watch</i>.) Yes, I think, Miss Marden, I had better go now and
return a little later. I have a telegram which I want to send, and
perhaps by the time I come back your uncle will be able&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>coming to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>). Oh, but how disappointing of you, when we
were getting on together so nicely! And it was just going to be your
turn to tell me all about yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. I have really nothing to tell, Miss Marden. I have a letter of
introduction to your uncle, who in turn will give me, I hope, a letter
to a certain distinguished man whom it is necessary for me to meet.
That is all. (<i>Holding out his hand</i>.) And now, Miss Marden, I
really think I'd better be going.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>taking his arm and hading him up stage</i> C. <i>to</i> L.).
Oh, I'll start you on your way to the post office.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Will you? Now, that's really very kind of you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. No, it isn't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, but it is! You're a very kind little girl.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. I want to know if you're married&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, no, I'm not married.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>.&ndash;and all that sort of thing. You've got heaps to tell me, Mr.
Pim. Have you got your hat? (<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>shows his hat</i>.) Oh yes! That's
right.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian Strange</span> <i>comes in from window up</i> R. <i>He is what</i>
<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>calls a damned futuristic painter chap, aged 24. To look at
he is a very pleasant boy, rather untidily dressed. He is about to
tell</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>the result of his interview with</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>when
he catches sight of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>.)</p>

<p>Then we'll&ndash;hullo, here's Brian! (<i>Crossing below and to his</i> R.
<i>seizing him</i>.) Brian, this is Mr. Pim! Mr. Carraway Pim. He's
been telling me all about himself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. I haven't said a word. I never opened my mouth.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. It's so interesting. He's just going to send a telegram, and
then he's coming back again. Mr. Pim&ndash;(<i>coyly and moving down to head
of settee</i> R.)&ndash;this is Brian&ndash;<i>you</i> know,</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>nodding</i>). How-do-you-do?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. How-do-you-do, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>pleadingly and crossing below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>),
You won't mind going to the post office by yourself now, will you?
(<i>Coyly moving up to chair by writing-table and nervously kicking her
ankle, etc</i>.) Because, you see, Brian and I&ndash;(<i>She looks lovingly
at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>moved to sentiment</i>). Miss Dinah and Mr.&ndash;er&ndash;Brian, I have
only come into your lives for a moment, and it is probable that I shall
now pass out of them for ever, but perhaps you will permit an old man&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh, not so old!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>chuckling happily</i>). Not old? Well, shall we say a middle-aged man&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>nods assent</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>laughs again</i>)&ndash;a
middle-aged man to wish you both every happiness in the years that you
have before you. (<i>Crossing in front of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>, <i>shakes hands
with</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) Good-bye&ndash;(<i>shaking hands with</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>)&ndash;good-bye,
and thank you so much. Oh, I know my way. (<i>Moving up</i> L. <i>and
turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>.) Turn to the left and down the hill? Turn to the
left and down the hill.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>up</i> L. <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>watches him off up</i> L. <i>on
terrace and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>up</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>coming into the room below writing-table to</i> R.C.). Brian,
he'll get lost if he goes that way.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>crossing at back of windows and calling after him up</i> L.).
Round to the left, sir. Yes, that's right. (<i>He comes back into the
room, crossing down</i> L.C.) Rum old bird. Who is he?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Darling, you haven't kissed me yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>moving up to her and pulling her down to below settee</i>
L.), Oh, I say. I oughtn't to, but then one never ought to do the nice
things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Why oughtn't you?</p>

<p>(<i>They sit on the sofa together&ndash;</i><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>to</i> R., <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>
<i>to</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Well, we said we'd be good until we'd told your uncle and aunt
all about it. You see, being a guest in their house&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. But, darling child, what <i>have</i> you been doing all this
morning <i>except</i> telling George?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Oh, <i>trying</i> to tell George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>nodding</i>). Yes, of course, there's a difference.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. I think he <i>guessed</i> there was something up, and he took me
down to see the pigs&ndash;he said he had to see the pigs at once&ndash;I don't
know why; an appointment perhaps. And we talked about pigs all the way,
and I couldn't say, "Talking about pigs, I want to marry your niece&ndash;"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>with mock indignation</i>). Oh, of course you couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. No. Well, you see how it was. And then when we'd finished
talking <i>about</i> pigs, we started talking <i>to</i> the pigs&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). Oh, <i>how</i> is Arnold?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Arnold...? Oh yes, that's the little black-and-white one? He's
very jolly, I believe, but naturally I wasn't thinking about him much.
I was wondering how to begin. And then Lumsden came up, and wanted to
talk pig-food, and the atmosphere grew less and less romantic, and&ndash;and
I gradually drifted away.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh, poor darling! Well, we shall have to approach him through
Olivia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. But I always wanted to tell her first; she's so much easier.
Only <i>you</i> wouldn't let me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. That's <i>your</i> fault, Brian. You would tell Olivia that she
ought to have orange-and-black curtains in here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. But she wants orange and black curtains in here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Yes. (<i>Rising and standing with her back to fire,
imitating</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>.) But George says he's not going to have any
Futuristic nonsense in an honest English country house, which has been
good enough for his father and his grandfather and his great-grandfather, and&ndash;and all the rest of them. (<i>Kneels on settee</i>.)
So there's a sort of strained feeling between Olivia and George just
now, and if Olivia were to&ndash;sort of recommend you, well, it wouldn't do
you much good.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>looking at her</i>). I see. Of course I know what <i>you</i>
want, Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. What do I want?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. You want a secret engagement&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. And notes left under door-mats&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. And meetings by the withered thorn&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. When all the household is asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. I know you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh, but it is such fun! I love meeting people by withered
thorns.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Well, I'm not going to have it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>childishly, sitting close to him</i>). Oh, George! Look at us
being husbandy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. You babe! I adore you. (<i>He kisses her and holds her
hands</i>.) You know, you're rather throwing yourself away on me. Do
you mind?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>putting her legs up on settee and reclining her head on his
shoulder</i>). Not a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. We shall never be rich, but we shall have lots of fun, and meet
interesting people, and feel that we're doing something worth doing,
and not getting paid nearly enough for it, and we can curse the Academy
together and the British Public, and&ndash;oh, it's an exciting life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>seeing it</i>). I shall love it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>sincerely</i>). I'll make you love it. You shan't be sorry,
Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. You shan't be sorry either, Brian.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>looking at her lovingly</i>). Oh, I know I shan't.... What
will Olivia think about it? Will she be surprised?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Olivia? Oh, she's never surprised. She always seems to have
thought of things about half an hour before they happen. George just
begins to get hold of them about half an hour after they've happened.
(<i>Considering him, stroking his hair</i>.) After all, there's no
reason why George shouldn't like you, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. I'm not his sort, you know, really.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. You're more Olivia's sort. Well, we'll tell Olivia this morning.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>comes in from top of staircase up R</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>coming in</i>). And what are you going to tell Olivia this
morning? (<i>They jump up and go to her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Olivia, darling&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>, Oh, well, I think I can guess,</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>goes to her</i> R, <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>to her</i> L., <i>and they bring her down</i>
C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>following</i>). Say you understand, Mrs. Marden.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Mrs. Marden, I am afraid, is a very dense person, Brian, but I
think if you asked Olivia if she understood&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Bless you, Olivia. I <i>knew</i> you'd be on our side.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Of course she would.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I don't know if it's usual to kiss an aunt-in-law, Brian, but
Dinah is such a very special sort of niece that&ndash;(<i>she inclines her
cheek and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>kisses it</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>backing away to</i> B. <i>a little</i>). I say, you are in
luck to-day, Brian.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>moves up</i> C. <i>laughing</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>crossing below settee</i> L. <i>and up</i> L. <i>to
cabinet</i>). And how many people have been told the good news?

<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Nobody yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Except Mr. Pim.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>crossing down to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>). Oh, does he&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>timing as she reaches cabinet, up</i> L.), Who's Mr, Pim?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh, he just happened&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>takes curtains and work-basket
from centre cupboard of cabinet</i>.)&ndash;I say, are those the curtains?
Then you're going to have them after all?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>with an air of surprise, coming down L., and putting work-basket on table L.C. and sitting with curtains</i>). After all what?
But I decided on them long ago. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) You haven't told
George yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>moving to below stool</i> L.C.). I began to, you know, but I
never got any farther than "Er&ndash;there's just&ndash;er&ndash;"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>crossing quickly below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and speaking into her
face</i>). George would talk about <i>pigs</i> all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, I suppose you want me to help you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>sitting to</i> L. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Oh, do, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>sits on stool</i> L.C.). It would be awfully decent of you.
Of course, I'm not quite his sort really&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. You're my sort.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. But I don't think he objects to me, and&ndash;</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>comes in from terrace, a typical, narrow-minded, honest
country gentleman of forty odd.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>rises hurriedly and
crosses to above piano to</i> R. <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>rises and stands by
fireplace.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>unfolds curtains and prepares to sew</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>at the windows&ndash;he does not see</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). Hullo! Hullo!
Hullo! What's all this about a Mr. Pim? Who is he? Where is he? (<i>He
puts his cap on table, and comes down, into room</i>.) I had most
important business with Lumsden, and the girl comes down and cackles
about a Mr, Pim, or Ping, or something. Where did I put his card?
(<i>Bringing it out</i>.) Carraway Pim. Never heard of him in my life,
(<i>Moves back to writing-table and puts down card</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. He said he had a letter of introduction, Uncle George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Oh, you saw him, did you! (<i>Comes down</i> C. <i>to</i> R.)
Yes, that reminds me, there was a letter&ndash;(<i>he brings it out and
reads it</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. He had to send a telegram. He's coming back.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Pass me those scissors, Brian.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>crossing to above table</i> L.C.). These? (<i>he passes
them</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>giving</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>a nod of encouragement and looking round
at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>). Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>reading</i>). Ah well, a friend of Brymer's, Glad to oblige
him. Yes, I know the man he wants. Coming back, you say, Dinah? (<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>
<i>nods</i>.) Then I'll be going back too. Send him down to the farm,
Olivia, when he comes. (<i>Going up meets</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) Hallo, what
happened to you? (<i>Still moving up a little</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Don't go, George, there's something we want to talk about.
(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>gives a long whistle. All look sheepish and</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>
<i>notices their attitude</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Hallo, what's this?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>quickly and over back of i.e. table to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Shall I&mdash;!
(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>pantomimes. "Yes, do."</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>with a roguish loot at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>). Yes, (<i>Sticks needle in
work</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>stepping out to</i> C.) I've been wanting to tell you all
this morning, sir, only I didn't seem to have an opportunity of getting
it out.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, what is it?</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>taken aback for a moment, looks to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>for
encouragement. She nods approval and turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>, <i>takes her
hand encouragingly&ndash;</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>boldly</i>). I want to marry Dinah, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You want to marry Dinah? God bless my soul!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>rushing to him below and to his</i> R. <i>and pulling her
cheek against his coat, and her hands on his shoulder</i>). Oh, do say
you like the idea, Uncle George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Like the idea! (<i>Taking her hands from his shoulder</i>.)
Have you heard of this nonsense, Olivia?</p>

<p>(<i>Movement of annoyance from</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. They've just this moment told me, George. I think they would be
happy together.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>crossing to fire-place</i> L., <i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). And what do
you propose to be happy together on?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (R.C.). Well, of course, I know it doesn't amount to much at
present, but we shan't starve.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Brian got fifty pounds for a picture last March!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>a little upset by this</i>). Oh! (<i>Recovering gamely</i>.)
And how many pictures have you sold since?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>gives a nervous look at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>, <i>who
then sits on settee</i> R.). Well, none, but&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. None! And I don't wonder. Who the devil is going to buy
pictures with triangular clouds and square sheep? (<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>annoyed,
moves up</i> R.C.) And they call that Art nowadays! Good God, man
(<i>moving up to the windows</i>), go outside and look at the clouds!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>busy stitching rings on curtains</i>). If he draws round
clouds in future, George, will you let him marry Dinah?</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>looks round, annoyed.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>is hopeful and comes down
towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>upset by this, coming down to head of</i> L.C.
<i>table</i>). What&ndash;what? Yes, of course, you would be on his side&ndash;all this Futuristic nonsense. (<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>commences to sew</i>.) I'm
just taking these clouds as an example. (<i>Crossing to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) I
suppose I can see as well as any man in the county, and I say that
clouds aren't triangular.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>ingratiatingly</i>). After all, sir, at my age one is
naturally experimenting, and trying to find one's (<i>with a
laugh)</i>&ndash;well, it sounds priggish, but one's medium of expression. I
shall find out what I want to do directly, but I think I shall always
be able to earn enough to live on. Well, I have for the last three
years.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I see, and now you want to experiment with a wife&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Yes&ndash;no&ndash;no&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Yes, you do,</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. And you propose to experimenting with my niece?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>with a shrug</i>). Well, of course, if you&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You could help the experiment, darling, by giving Dinah a good
allowance until she's twenty-one.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Help the experiment! I don't <i>want</i> to help the
experiment. (<i>Crossing up to writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>apologetically</i>). Oh, I thought you did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You will talk as if I was made of money. What with taxes always
going up and rents always going down, it's as much as we can do to rub
along as we are (<i>to back of</i> L.C. <i>table</i>), without making
allowances to everybody who thinks she wants to get married. (<i>To</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) And that's thanks to you, my friend.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>surprised</i>). To me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You never told me, darling. What's Brian been doing?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). He hasn't been doing anything.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>round to foot of table</i> L.C.). He's one of your
Socialists who go turning the country upside down.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But even Socialists must get married sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>crossing below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>to fireplace</i>). I don't see
any necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But you'd have nobody to damn after dinner, darling, if they
all died out.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>coming a little</i> C.). Really, sir, I don't see what my
politics and my art have got to do with it. I'm perfectly ready not to
talk about either when I'm in your house, and as Dinah doesn't seem to
object to them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>moving towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>and championing him</i>). I
should think she doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Oh, you can get round the women, I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Well, it's Dinah I want to marry and live with. So what it
really comes to is that you don't think I can support a wife.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, if you're going to do it by selling pictures, I don't
think you can.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>moving to</i> R. <i>of table</i> L.C.). All right, tell me
how much you want me to earn in a year, and I'll earn it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>hedging</i>). It isn't merely a question of money. I just
mention that as one thing&ndash;one of the important things. (<span class="smallcaps">George</span>
<i>crosses to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>who backs towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>.) In addition to
that, I think you are both too young to marry. (<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>stamps her
foot</i>.) I don't think you know your own minds (<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>kneels
dejectedly on settee</i> R.), and I am not at all persuaded that, with
what I venture to call your outrageous tastes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> You and my niece will live happily together. (<i>Pause. Crossing
up to writing-table, sits</i>.) Just because she thinks she loves you,
Dinah may persuade herself now that she agrees with all you say and do,
but she has been properly brought up in an honest English country
household&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>throws up her arms and buries her face in her
hands on piano</i>) and&ndash;er&ndash;she&ndash;well, in short, I cannot at all
approve of any engagement between you. (<i>Getting up</i>.) Olivia, if
this Mr.&ndash;er&ndash;Pim comes, I shall be down at the farm You might send him
along to me.</p>

<p>(<i>He walks towards the windows up</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>moving up</i> R., <i>followed by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>;
<i>indignantly</i>). Is there any reason why I shouldn't marry a girl
who has been properly brought up?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I think you know my views, Strange.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>, <i>disappointed, crosses down</i> R. <i>again to below
table</i> R.C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. George, wait a moment, dear. We can't quite leave it like this.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I have said all I want to say on the subject.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>sits on settee</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes, darling, but I haven't begun to say all that <i>I</i> want
to say on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>crossing down to back of table</i> L.C.). Of course, if you
have anything to say, Olivia, I will listen to it; but I don't know
that this is quite the time&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>makes a marked movement as she
is sewing the curtains</i>), or that you have chosen&ndash;(<i>looking
darkly at the curtains</i>)&ndash;quite the occupation likely to&ndash;er&ndash;endear
your views to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>mutinously, rising quickly and crossing to stool on which she
kneels and looks up into</i> <span class="smallcaps">George's</span> <i>face and bangs the table</i>).
I may as well tell you, Uncle George, that I have got a good deal to
say, too.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>crosses down to her</i> R., <i>gingerly pulling her sleeve,
trying to restrain her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes, darling. I can guess what you are going to say, Dinah, and
I think you had better keep it for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>meekly, backing to</i> R. <i>below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>and to</i> L.
<i>of table</i> R.C.). Yes, Aunt Olivia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Brian, you might take her outside for a walk. I expect you have
plenty to talk about.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>move up</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>following them up</i>). Now mind, Strange, no love-making. I
put you on your honour about that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>looking round dubiously at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>). I'll do my best to
avoid it, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>cheekily</i>). May I take his arm if we go up a hill?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I'm sure you'll know how to behave&ndash;both of you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (R. <i>of writing-table</i>). Come on, then, Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>following him</i>). Right-o. (<i>They exeunt through windows
and off to</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>as they go</i>). And if you do see any clouds, Strange, take
a good look at them. (<i>He chuckles to himself</i>.) Triangular
clouds&ndash;I never heard of such nonsense. (<i>He goes back to his chair
at the writing-table and sits</i>.) Futuristic rubbish... Well, Olivia?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>sewing curtains</i>). Well, George?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. What are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Making curtains&ndash;(<i>grunt of disapproval from</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>)&ndash;George. Won't they be rather sweet? Oh, but I forgot&ndash;you don't like
them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. No. I don't like them, and what is more, I don't mean to have
them in my house. As I told you yesterday, this is the house of a
simple country gentleman, and I don't want any of these new-fangled
ideas in it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Is marrying for love a new-fangled idea?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. We'll come to that directly. None of you women can keep to the
point. What I am saying now is that the house of my fathers and
forefathers is good enough for me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Do you know, George, I can hear one of your ancestors saying
that to his wife in their smelly old cave&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>looks up annoyed
at her levity</i>)&ndash;when the new-fangled idea of building houses was
first suggested. "The Cave of my Forefathers is good enough for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rising and coming to</i> R. <i>of</i> L.C. <i>table</i>).
That's ridiculous. Naturally we must have progress. But that's just the
point. (<i>Indicating the curtains</i>.) I don't call this sort of
thing progress. It's&ndash;ah&ndash;retrogression.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, anyhow, it's pretty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. There I disagree with you. And I must say once more that I will
not have them hanging in my house. (<i>Going up</i> R.C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Very well, George. (<i>But she goes on working</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>seeing her continuing to sew, stops</i>). That being so, I
don't see the necessity of going on with them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, I must do something with them now I've got the material.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>goes up to writing-table, sits and writes</i>.)</p>

<p>I thought perhaps I could sell them when they're finished&ndash;as we're so
poor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>turns to her with surprised look</i>). What do you mean&ndash;so
poor?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, you said just now that you couldn't give Dinah an
allowance because rents had gone down.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>annoyed</i>). Confound it, Olivia! Keep to the point! We'll
talk about Dinah's affairs directly. We're discussing our own affairs
at the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But what is there to discuss, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, those ridiculous things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But we've finished that. You've said you wouldn't have them
hanging in your house, and I've said, "Very well, George."&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">George</span>
<i>is again annoyed</i>.)&ndash;Now we can go on to Dinah, and Brian.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>shouting</i>). But put these beastly things away.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>rising and gathering up the curtains</i>). Very well,
George.</p>

<p>(<i>Going up</i> L. <i>she places the curtains on the cabinet</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>waits impatiently until she has put them away on top of
cabinet</i>). Ah! That's better.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>comes to table</i> L.C., <i>closes her workbox and then
crosses down to settee</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rising and crossing down to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and placing arms
lovingly on her shoulder</i>). Now look here, Olivia, old girl, you've
been a jolly good wife to me&ndash;(<i>takes his arms from her
shoulder</i>)&ndash;and we don't often have rows, and if I've been rude to
you about this&ndash;lost my temper a bit perhaps, what?&ndash;I'll say I'm
sorry. May I have a kiss?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>holding up her face</i>). George, darling! (<i>He kisses
her</i>.) Do you love me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You know I do, old girl.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. As much as Brian loves Dinah?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>stiffly, taking her hands from his shoulders</i>). I've said
all I want to say about that. (<i>He goes away from her to</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, but there must be lots you want to say and perhaps don't
like to. (<i>Sits on settee</i> R.) Do tell me, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coming back to</i> C.). What it comes to is this. I consider
that Dinah is too young to choose a husband for herself, and that
Strange isn't the husband I should choose for her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You were calling him Brian yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yesterday I regarded him as a boy, now he wants me to look upon
him as a man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. He's twenty-four.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes, and Dinah's nineteen. Ridiculous. (<i>Crossing up to
smoking-table up</i> R., <i>and filling his pipe which he finds on
table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. If he'd been a Conservative, and thought that clouds were
round, I suppose he'd have seemed older, somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. That's a different point altogether. That has nothing to do
with his age.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>innocently</i>). Oh, I thought it had.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>crossing down</i> C. <i>stuffing tobacco into his pipe</i>).
What I am objecting to is these ridiculously early marriages before
either party knows its own mind, much less the mind of the other party.
(<i>Moving to fireplace looking for a match</i>.) Such marriages
invariably lead to unhappiness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Of course, <i>my</i> first marriage wasn't a happy one.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. As you know, Olivia, I dislike speaking about your first
marriage at all&ndash;(<i>takes a match from table down</i> L. <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>
rises slowly and goes up to</i> R. <i>of writing-table</i>)&ndash;and I had
no intention of bringing it up now, but since you mention it&ndash;well,
there's a case in point. (<i>Sits on settee</i> L., <i>lighting his
pipe</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>looking back at it</i>). When I was eighteen, I was in love.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>turning to her</i>). What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Or perhaps I only thought I was, and I don't know if I should
have been happy or not if I had married him. But my father made me
marry Mr. Jacob Telworthy. (<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>looks up at her, annoyed</i>.)
And when things were too hot for him in England&ndash;"too hot for him"&ndash;I
think that was the expression we used in those days&ndash;then we went to
Australia, and I left him there. (<i>Goes slowly down to back of
settee</i> L.) And the only happy moment I had in all my married life
was on the morning when I saw in the papers that he was dead. (<i>Leans
with her arms over back of settee</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>very uncomfortable yet lovingly taking her hands with his
left hand</i>). Yes, yes, my dear, I know, I know. You must have had a
terrible time. I can hardly bear to think about it. My only hope is
that I have made up to you for it in some degree. (<i>She places her
left cheek lovingly on his head</i>.) (<i>Dropping her hands</i>.) But
I don't see what bearing it has upon Dinah's case.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, none, except that <i>my</i> father <i>liked</i> Jacob's
political opinions and his views on art. (<i>Moving slowly round</i>
L.C. <i>table to below stool at foot</i>.) I expect that that was why
he chose him for me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You seem to think that I wish to choose a husband for Dinah. I
don't at all. Let her choose whom she likes as long as he can support
her and there's a chance of their being happy together. Now, with
regard to this fellow&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You mean Brian?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, he's got no money, and he's been brought up in quite a
different way from Dinah. Dinah may be prepared to believe that&ndash;er&ndash;all cows are blue, and that&ndash;er&ndash;waves are square, but she won't go on
believing it for ever.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Neither will Brian.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>moving to</i> R. <i>end of settee</i>). Well, that's what I
keep telling him, only he won't see it. Just as I keep telling you
about those ridiculous curtains. (<i>Points to cupboard with pipe in
right hand over his left shoulder</i>.) It seems to me that I am the
only person in the house with any eyesight left.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Perhaps you are, darling; but you must let us find out our own
mistakes for ourselves. (<i>Sits on stool</i> L.C.) At any rate, Brian
is a gentleman; he loves Dinah, Dinah loves him; he's earning enough to
support himself, and you are earning enough to support Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>amazed</i>). What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I think it's worth risking, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>stiffly</i>). I can only say the whole question demands much
more anxious thought than you seem to have given it. You say that he is
a gentleman. He knows how to behave, I admit; but if his morals are as
topsy-turvy as his tastes and&ndash;er&ndash;politics, as I've no doubt they are
(<i>rising and moving to</i> L.), then-er&ndash;In short, I do <i>not</i>
approve of Brian Strange as a husband for my niece and ward. (<i>Knocks
pipe out down</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>looking at him thoughtfully</i>). You <i>are</i> a curious
mixture, George. You were so very unconventional when you married me,
and you're so very conventional when Brian wants to marry Dinah....
George Marden to marry the widow of a convict!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>advancing</i>). Convict! What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Jacob Telworthy, convict&ndash;I forget his number&ndash;surely I told
you all this, dear, when we got engaged?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Never!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, but I told you how he carelessly put the wrong signature to
a cheque for a thousand pounds in England; how he made a little mistake
about two or three companies he'd promoted in Australia; and how&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes, yes (<i>crossing slowly to</i> C. <i>below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>),
but you never told me he'd been&ndash;er&ndash;well&ndash;<i>convicted</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. What difference does it make?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. My dear Olivia, if you can't see that&ndash;a&ndash;a&ndash;oh, well!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh! A convict! So, you see, we needn't be too particular about
our niece, need we?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I think we had better leave your first husband out of the
conversation altogether. I never wished to refer to him; I never wish
to hear about him again. I certainly had not realized that he was
actually&ndash;er&ndash;well&ndash;convicted for his&ndash;er&ndash;(<i>moving to writing-table
and picking up his cap</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Mistakes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, we needn't go into that. As for this other matter, I
don't for a moment take it seriously. Dinah is an exceptionally pretty
girl, and young. Strange is a good-looking boy. (<i>Coming down to back
of settee</i> L.) If they are attracted to each other, it is a mere
outward attraction which I am convinced will not lead to any lasting
happiness. (<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>is about to protest</i>.) That must be regarded
as my last word in the matter, Olivia. If this Mr.&ndash;er&ndash;what was his
name, comes, I shall be down at the farm. (<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>goes out by the
staircase up</i> R.)</p>

<p>(<i>Left alone,</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>rises, goes up</i> C., <i>takes up her
curtains again and crossing down</i> L. <i>sits on settee, and gets
calmly to work upon them</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>comes in by the windows from up</i> R. <i>and crosses to</i>
L. <i>window at back, then seeing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>, <i>beckons to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>
<i>and runs down to back of settee to</i> R. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>
<i>enters from up</i> R., <i>and follows down to back of table</i>
L.C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>over back of settee</i>). Finished?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>startled</i>). Oh, no, I've got all these rings to put on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. I meant talking to George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. We walked about outside&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Until we heard him <i>not</i> talking to you any more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. And we didn't kiss each other once.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah and Brian</span> (<i>pointing roguishly and with satisfaction at</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Brian was very George-like. He wouldn't even let me tickle the
back of his neck. (<i>She goes suddenly to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and sits on
her</i> L.) Darling (<i>putting her arms round</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and
kissing her</i>), being George-like is a very nice thing to be&ndash;I mean
a nice thing for other people to be&ndash;I mean&ndash;oh, you know what I mean.
But say that he's going to be decent about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Of course he is, Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>sits on stool</i> L.C., <i>and leans forward eagerly</i>).
You mean he'll let me come here as&ndash;as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. As my young man?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>kissing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Olivia, you're a wonder.</p>

<p>(<i>Embraces her round the neck</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>Rising and crossing below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>touching him on the
shoulder</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>!</p>

rises and crosses at back of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>to</i> L. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>
<i>behind settee</i>.)</p>

<p>Have you really talked him round?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I haven't said anything yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>very disappointed</i>). Oh!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>rises and backs to</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But I dare say I shall think of something.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Oh! my lord.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>disappointedly</i>). Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>going up</i> C.). After all, Dinah, I'm going back to London
to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>crossing quickly towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). Oh, no, no!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Now, Dinah. You can be good for one more day, and then when
Brian isn't here, we'll see what we can do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>placing her hands on</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian's</span> <i>shoulders</i>). Yes, but
I didn't want him to go back to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>sternly, taking her hands away</i>). Must. Hard work before
me. (<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>moves to back of table</i> L.C.) Earn thousands a year.
(<i>Going down</i> R. <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>are amused</i>). Paint
the Mayor and Corporation of Pudsey, life-size, including chains of
office; paint slice of haddock on plate. Copy Landseer for old
gentleman in Bayswater. Design antimacassar for middle-aged sofa in
Streatham. (<i>Sitting and putting his legs up on settee R</i>.) Oh,
yes. Earn a living for you. Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>giggling</i>). Oh, Brian, you're heavenly. What fun we shall
have when we're married.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>with exaggerated dignity</i>). Sir Brian Strange, R.A., if
you please, Miss Marden. Sir Brian Strange, R.A., writes: "Your
Sanogene has proved a most excellent tonic. After completing the third
acre of my Academy picture, 'The Mayor and Corporation of Pudsey,' I
was completely exhausted, but one bottle of Sanogene revived me, and I
finished the remaining seven acres at a single sitting."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>rising and looking about her</i>). Brian, find my scissors
for me. (<i>Sits again</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>rising and crossing to</i> C.). Scissors. Sir Brian Strange,
R.A., looks for scissors.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>clasping his hands behind his back, with a very important

<p>Once more we must record an unqualified success for the eminent
Academician. (<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and with a bow hands them
over the back of settee to her</i>.) Your scissors.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Thank you so much.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Come on, Brian, let's go out. I feel open-airy.</p>

<p>(<i>They go up</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Don't be late for lunch, there's good people. Lady Marden is
coming.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Aunt Juli-ah! Help! (<i>She faints in</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian's</span> <i> arms</i>.)
That means a clean pinafore. Brian, you'll jolly well have to brush
your hair.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>feeling it</i>). I suppose there's no time now to go up to
London and get it cut?</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>from stairs up R. and comes to foot of staircase,
followed by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>, <i>who comes half-way down the stairs</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Mr. Pim!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>delighted</i>). Hullo. Mr. Pim! (<i>Imitating a clown</i>.)
Here we are again! You can't get rid of us so easily, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. I&ndash;er&ndash;dear Miss Marden&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Crosses down to</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. How-do-you-do, Mr. Pim? I can't get up, but do come and sit
down (<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>shakes hands with</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) My husband will be here in
a minute. Anne, send somebody down to the farm&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>, I think I heard the Master in the library, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, will you tell him then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Yes, madam,</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>goes out up staircase</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You'll stay to lunch, of course, Mr. Pim?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>coming down</i> C. <i>to</i> R.) Oh, do!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. It's very kind of you, Mrs. Marden, but&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh, you simply must, Mr. Pim. You haven't told us half enough
about yourself yet. I want to hear all about your early life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Dinah!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>sits at piano and plays thirty-two bars of "If you could only
care."</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, we are almost, I might say, old friends, Mrs. Marden.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>comes down and kneels on settee</i> R., <i>listening to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>playing</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Of course we are. He knows Brian, too. There's more in Mr. Pim
than you think. You will stay to lunch, won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. (<i>sits on stool</i> L.C.) It's very kind of you to ask me, Mrs.
Marden, but I am lunching with the Trevors.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, well, you must come to lunch another day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, thank you, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. The reason why we like Mr. Pim so much is that he was the first
person to congratulate us. We feel that he is going to have a great
influence on our lives.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). I, so to speak, stumbled on the engagement
this morning, and&ndash;er&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I see. Children, you must go and tidy yourselves up. Run along.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Sir Brian and Lady Strange never run; they walk.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>stops playing</i>.) (<i>Offering his</i> R. <i>arm and
bowing</i>.) Madam!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>curtsies and takes his arm and they go up</i> C.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>takes mincing steps and playfully shakes her hand at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span>, <i>who is amused</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Au revoir, Mr. Pim. (<i>Dramatically</i>.) We&ndash;shall&ndash;meet&ndash;<i>again</i>!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. <i>laughing heartily, rises and bows</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>go out through the window up</i> C.
<i>to</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You must forgive them, Mr. Pim. They're such children. And
naturally they're rather excited just now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, naturally, naturally!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Of course you won't say anything about their engagement. We
only heard about it five minutes ago, and nothing has been settled yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Of course, of course!</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>from staircase up</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Ah, Mr. Pim, we meet at last. Sorry to have kept you waiting
before. (<i>Shaking hands</i>.) How are you? How are you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. The apology should come from me, Mr. Marden, for having&ndash;er&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Not at all. Very glad to meet you now. Any friend of Brymer's.
You want a letter to this man Fanshawe?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Shall I be in your way at all?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, no, no, please don't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Oh, no. It's only just a question of a letter. Fanshawe will
put you in the way of seeing all that you want to see. (<i>Crossing up
to writing-table, sits</i>.) He's a very old friend of mine. (<i>Taking
a sheet of notepaper and turning in chair to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>.) You'll stay to
lunch, of course?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. It's very kind of you, but I'm lunching with the Trevors. (<i>Sits
settee R. and puts down his hat and gloves</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Ah, well, they'll look after you all right. Good chap, Trevor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, very good ... very good. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) You see, Mrs.
Marden, I have only recently arrived from Australia&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>stops
in her sewing and</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>looks up</i>)&ndash;after travelling about
the world for some years, and I'm rather out of touch with my&ndash;er&ndash;fellow-workers in London.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I see! You've been in Australia, Mr. Pim?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, yes, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>after a loud cough</i>). Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Pim.
I shan't be a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, that's all right, thank you. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) Oh, yes, I
have been in Australia more than once in the last few years.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Really? I used to live at Sydney many years ago. Do you know
Sydney at all?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, yes, I was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coughing</i>). H'r'm! Perhaps I'd better mention that you
are a friend of the Trevors?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Thank you, thank you. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) Indeed yes, I spent
several months in Sydney a few years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. How curious! I wonder if we have any friends in common there.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coughing and gruffly</i>). Extremely unlikely, I should
think. Sydney is a very big place.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. True, true, but the world is a very small place, Mr. Marden. I had
a remarkable instance of that, coming over on the boat this last time.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Ah! (<i>Feeling that the conversation is now safe, he resumes
his letter</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Yes. There was a man I used to employ in Sydney some years ago, a
bad fellow, I'm afraid, Mrs. Marden, who had been in prison for some
kind of fraudulent company-promoting and had taken to drink and&ndash;and so
on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes, yes, I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Drinking himself to death, I should have said. I gave him at the
most another year to live. Yet to my amazement the first person I saw
as I stepped on board the boat that brought me to England last week was
this fellow. There was no mistaking him. I spoke to him, in fact; we
recognized each other.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>rises</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Really?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. He was travelling steerage; we didn't meet again on board, and as
it happened at Marseilles, this poor fellow&ndash;er&ndash;now what was his name?
A very unusual one. Began with a&ndash;a T, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>with suppressed feeling</i>). Yes, Mr. Pim, yes? (<i>She
puts out a hand to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>in an undertone, taking her hand</i>). Nonsense, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>triumphantly</i>). I've got it! Telworthy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>draws back in settee, overcome</i>). Telworthy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Good God!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>a little surprised at the success of his story</i>). An unusual
name, is it not? Not a name you could forget when once you had heard
it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>with feeling, gazing into space with hands clenched</i>).
No, it is not a name you could forget when once you had heard it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>hastily coming over to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>). Quite so, Mr. Pim, a most
remarkable name, a most odd story altogether. Well, well, here's your
letter&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>rises and tales letter</i>)&ndash;and if you're sure you
won't stay to lunch&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No, thank you. You see, I'm lunching with&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. With the Trevors, yes. I remember you told me. (<i>Taking his

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>enters with coffee for five on salver, from double doors</i>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. We'll have coffee on the terrace, Anne.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Very good, madam. (<i>Moves up</i> L. <i>and places salver on

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>exits at doors</i> R.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>turns, and seeing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>is annoyed, follows</i>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). I know Aunt Julia likes a little music.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>comes down to piano and takes up small guitar.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>
<i>crosses to</i> L., <i>laughing at her. She goes up</i> L. <i>of

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>). No! No! Don't do it!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Your aunt does not like it, dear.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>want to be alone, so do</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. <i>At last</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>murmurs something about a
cigarette-case, and catching</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah's</span> <i>eye, comes into the room.
He leans against the sofa down</i> L. <i>and waits for her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>loudly, as she comes in strumming on guitar</i>). Have you
found it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Found what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>in her ordinary voice, crossing quickly down to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>).
That was just for <i>their</i> benefit. I said I'd help you find it. It
<i>is</i> your cigarette-case we're looking for, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>taking it out</i>). Yes. Have one?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. No, thank you, darling. (<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>goes up</i> R. <i>in smoking-table for a match</i>.) Aunt Juli-ah still thinks it's unladylike....
Have you ever seen her beagling? (<i>Comes down to piano, puts down
instrument</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. No. Is that very ladylike?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>sitting on settee</i> R.). Very.... I say, what has happened,
do you think?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>moving down to back of table</i> R.C.). Everything. I love
you, and you love me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Silly! I meant between George and Olivia. Didn't you notice them
at lunch?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>sits on table</i>). I noticed that you seemed to be doing
most of the talking. But then I've noticed that before sometimes. Do
you think Olivia and your uncle have quarrelled because of <i>us</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Of course not. George may <i>think</i> he has quarrelled, but
I'm quite sure Olivia hasn't. No (<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>beckons to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>who
comes and sits above her</i>), I believe Mr. Pim's at the bottom of it.
He's brought some terribly sad news about George's investments.
(<i>Rising and facing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) The old home will have to be sold up.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Good. Then your uncle won't mind your marrying me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>by table above settee</i> R.). Yes, darling, but you must be
more dramatic about it than that. "George," you must say, with tears in
your eyes, "I cannot pay off the whole of the mortgage for you. I have
only two and ninepence; but at least let me take your niece off your
hands." Then George will (<i>hitting him on the shoulder)</i> thump you
on the back and say gruffly (<i>crossing to</i> L.), "You're a good
fellow, Brian, a damn good fellow," and he'll blow his nose very
loudly, and say, "Confound this cigar, it won't draw properly."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>rising and crossing to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>). Dinah, you're a heavenly
idiot. And you've simply got to marry me, uncles or no uncles.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Hush! (<i>She takes his hand and they sit on settee</i> L.,
<i>hiding from others at back</i>). It will have to be "uncles," I'm
afraid, because, you see, I'm his ward, and I can get sent to Chancery
or Coventry or somewhere beastly, if I marry without his consent,
Haven't <i>you</i> got anybody who objects to your marrying <i>me</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Nobody, thank Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Well, that's rather disappointing of you. I saw myself
fascinating your aged father at the same time that you were fascinating
George. I should have done it much better than you. As a George-fascinator you aren't very successful, sweetheart.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>kissing her hand</i>). What am I like as a Dinah-fascinator?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Plus six, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Then I'll stick to that and leave George to Olivia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. I expect she'll manage him all right. I have great faith in
Olivia. But you'll marry me, anyhow, won't you, Brian?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. I will.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Even if we have to wait till I'm twenty-one?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Even if we have to wait till you're fifty-one.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>holding out her hands to him</i>). Darling!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). I say, don't do that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Well, I promised I wouldn't kiss you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Oh! (<i>Rising and crossing to</i> C., <i>watching the others at
back</i>). Well, you might just send me a kiss. You can look the other
way as if you didn't know I was here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Like this?</p>

<p>(<i>He looks the other way, kisses the tips of his fingers, and flicks
it carelessly in her direction. She pretends to catch it, kissing her
own hands</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. That was a lovely one. Now here's one coming for you.</p>

<p>(<i>She throws him a kiss. He catches it gracefully and conveys it to
his mouth</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>rising, and with a low bow</i>). Madam, I thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>curtsying</i>). Your servant, Mr. Strange,</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>rising from outside</i>). Dinah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>jumping up</i>). Hullo! (<i>Moving quickly to piano, plays
"Mickey."</i>)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>throws away his cigarette and walks to</i> L.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>comes in through the window up</i> L., <i>followed by</i>
<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>, <i>the latter a vigorous young woman of
sixty odd, who always looks as if she were beagling</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>coming down to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>above piano</i>). Aunt Julia
wants to see the pigs, dear. I wish you'd take her down. I'm rather
tired, and your uncle has some business to attend to.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>sits in chair up</i> C. <i>in front of writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>moving down</i> C.), I've always said that you don't
take enough exercise, Olivia. (<i>Turning to others</i>.) Look at me&ndash;sixty-five and proud of it. (<i>Goes up</i> R. <i>and takes up gloves
and riding-whip from writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>taking off her coatee</i>). Yes, Aunt Julia, you're
wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. How old would Olivia be if she took exercise?</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>, <i>smiling, but with an admonishing look at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>,
<i>comes up</i> R. <i>and places her coatee on balustrade</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>from up</i> C.). Don't fool about asking silly questions,
Dinah. Your aunt hasn't much time.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. May I come, too, Lady Marden?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>coming down centre to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). Well, a little
exercise wouldn't do <i>you</i> any harm, Mr. Strange. You're an
artist, ain't you?</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>stops playing</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Well, I try to paint.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>rises and moves to</i> R.C.). He sold a picture last March
for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes, yes, never mind that now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Yes, unhealthy life. (<i>Going to</i> R. <i>of writing-table and crossing at back, turns to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) Well,
come along.</p>

<p>(<i>She strides out up</i> L., <i>followed by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>who upset</i> <span class="smallcaps">George's</span> <i>papers on writing-table as they
go</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>takes the curtains and workbox from</i> C.
<i>cupboard of cabinet and comes down</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>looking up and seeing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Really, Olivia, we've got
something more important, more vital to us than curtains, to discuss,
now that we <i>are</i> alone at last.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I wasn't going to discuss them, dear. (<i>Sits</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Of course, I'm always glad to see Aunt Julia in my house, but I
wish she hadn't chosen this day of all days to come to lunch.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. It wasn't Aunt Julia's fault. It was really Mr. Pim who chose
the wrong day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>fiercely and rising</i>). Good heavens, is it true?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. About Jacob Telworthy?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yon told me he was dead. (<i>Moving down to</i> L. <i>of</i> L.C.
<i>table</i>.) You always said that he was dead.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, I always thought that he was dead. He was as dead as
anybody could be. All the papers said he was dead.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>scornfully</i>). The papers!(<i>Crossing up to smoking-table
for his pipe</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>as if this would settle it for</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). The <i>Times</i>
said he was dead. There was a paragraph about him. Apparently even his
death was fraudulent.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coming down</i> C.). Yes, yes, I'm not blaming you, Olivia,
but what are we going to do, that's the question, what are we going to
do? My God, it's horrible! (<i>Crossing to fireplace</i>.) You've never
been married to me at all! You don't seem to understand.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. It is a little difficult to realize. You see, it doesn't seem
to have made any difference to our happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. No, that's what's so terrible. (<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>looks up
surprised</i>.) I mean&ndash;well, of course, we were quite innocent in the
matter. (<i>Sits in arm-chair down</i> L.) But, at the same time,
nothing can get over the fact that we&ndash;we had no right to&ndash;to be happy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Would you rather we had been miserable?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You're Telworthy's wife, that's what you don't seem to
understand. You're Telworthy's wife. You&ndash;er&ndash;forgive me, Olivia, but
it's the horrible truth&ndash;you committed bigamy when you married me.
(<i>In horror, going up</i> L.) Bigamy! (<i>Coming round to</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. It is an ugly word, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes, but you don't understand. (<i>Coming quickly down</i> C.,
<i>sits on stool</i> L.C., <i>facing her</i>.) Look here, Olivia, old
girl, the whole thing is nonsense, eh? It isn't your husband, it's some
other Telworthy that this fellow met. That's right, isn't it? Some
other shady swindler who turned up on the boat, eh? This sort of thing
doesn't happen to people like <i>us</i>&ndash;committing bigamy and all
that. Some other fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>shaking her head</i>). I knew all the shady swindlers in
Sydney.... They came to dinner.... There were no others called
Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rising with gesture of despair</i>). Well, what are we going
to do?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You sent Mr. Pim away so quickly. He might have told us things.
Telworthy's plans. Where he is now. You hurried him away so quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I've sent a note round to ask him to come back. My one idea at
the moment was to get him out of the house&ndash;to hush things up.
(<i>Going up to writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You can't hush up two husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>in despair</i>). You can't. (<i>Sits at writing-table</i>.)
Everybody will know. Everybody!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. The children, Aunt Julia, they may as well know now as later.
Mr. Pim must, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I do not propose to discuss my private affairs with Mr. Pim&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But he's mixed himself up in them rather, hasn't he, and if
you're going to ask him questions&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I only propose to ask him one question. I shall ask him if he
is absolutely certain of this fellow's name. I can do that quite easily
without letting him know the reason for my inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You couldn't make a mistake about a name like Telworthy. But he
might tell us something about Telworthy's plans. Perhaps he's going
back to Australia at once. Perhaps he thinks I'm dead, too. Perhaps&ndash;oh, there are so many things I want to know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes, yes, dear. It would be interesting to&ndash;that is, one
naturally wants to know these things, but of course it doesn't make any
real difference.

<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>surprised</i>). No difference?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rising and coming down to back of settee</i> L.). Well, that
is to say, you're as much his wife if he's in Australia as you are if
he's in England.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I am not his wife at all. (<i>Shaking her head</i>.) Jacob
Telworthy may be alive, but I am not his wife. I ceased to be his wife
when I became yours.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You never <i>were</i> my wife. (<i>Annoyed and crossing to</i>
R. <i>and back again to</i> L.C.) That is the terrible part of it. Our
union&ndash;you make me say it, Olivia&ndash;has been unhallowed by the Church.
Unhallowed even by the Law. Legally, we have been living in&ndash;living in&ndash;well, the point is, how does the Law stand? I imagine that Telworthy
could get a&ndash;a divorce.... Oh, it seems impossible that things like
this can be happening to <i>us</i>. (<i>Going up</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. A divorce?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I&ndash;I imagine so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But then we could <i>really</i> get married, and we shouldn't
be living in&ndash;living in&ndash;whatever we were living in before.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coming down to</i> R. <i>of table</i> L.C.). I can't
understand you, Olivia. You talk about it so calmly, as if there was
nothing blameworthy in being divorced.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. As if there was nothing unusual in my marrying a divorced
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. As if there was nothing wrong in our having lived together for
years without having been married.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>placing her hands on table</i>). What seems wrong to me is
that I lived for five years with a bad man whom I hated. What seems
right to me is that I lived for five years with a good man whom I love.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>taking and patting her hands affectionately</i>). Yes, yes,
my dear, I know. (<i>Drops her hands and moves to</i> C.) But right and
wrong don't settle themselves as easily as that. We've been living
together when you were Telworthy's wife. That's <i>wrong</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Do you mean wicked?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, no doubt the Court would consider that we acted in
perfect innocence&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. What Court?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, you see, my dear, these things have to be done legally,
of course. (<i>Moving to</i> R. <i>to settee, thinking it out</i>.) I
believe the proper method is a nullity suit, declaring our marriage
null and&ndash;er&ndash;void. It would, so to speak, wipe out these years of&ndash;er&mdash;(<i>Moving back to</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Wickedness?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Of irregular union, and-er&ndash;then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Then I could go back to Jacob.... Do you really mean that,
George?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>uneasily</i>). Well, dear, you see-that's how things are&ndash;one can't get away from&ndash;er&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. What you feel is that Telworthy has the greater claim? You are
prepared to&ndash;make way for him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Both the Church and the Law would say that I had no claim at
all, I'm afraid. I&ndash;I suppose I haven't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I see. (<i>She looks at him curiously</i>.) Thank you for
making it so clear, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Of course, whether or not you go back to&ndash;er&ndash;Telworthy is
another matter altogether. (<i>Crossing to fireplace</i>.) That would
naturally be for you to decide.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>cheerfully</i>). For me and Jacko to decide.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Er&ndash;Jacko?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I used to call my first husband&ndash;I mean my only husband&ndash;Jacko.
I didn't like the name of Jacob, and Jacko seemed to suit him somehow.
(<i>Enjoying the joke</i>.) He had very long arms. (<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>is very
annoyed</i>.) Poor Jacko.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>annoyed</i>). You don't seem to realize that this is not a
joke, Olivia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>still amused</i>). It may not be a joke, but it is funny,
isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I must say I don't see anything funny in a tragedy that has
wrecked two lives.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Two? Oh, but Jacko's life isn't wrecked. It has just been
miraculously restored to him. And a wife, too. There's nothing tragic
for Jacko in it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>stiffly</i>). I was referring to <i>our</i> two lives&ndash;yours
and mine.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yours, George? Your life isn't wrecked. The Court will absolve
you of all blame; your friends will sympathize with you, and tell you
that I was a designing woman who deliberately took you in; your Aunt
Julia&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>overwrought</i>). Stop it! (<i>Crossing over to her</i>.)
What do you mean? Have you no heart? (<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>gives a little hurt
cry</i>.) Do you think I <i>want</i> to lose you, Olivia? (<i>Sits on
her</i> L.) Do you think I <i>want</i> my home broken up like this?
Haven't you been happy with me these last five years?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Very happy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well then, how can you talk like that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But you want to send me away,</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. There you go again. I don't <i>want</i> to. I have hardly had
time to realize just what it will mean to me when you go. The fact is I
simply daren't realize it. I daren't think about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Try thinking about it, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. And you talk as if I <i>wanted</i> to send you away!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Try thinking about it, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You don't seem to understand that I'm not <i>sending</i> you
away. You simply aren't mine to keep.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Whose am I?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>dubiously</i>). Your husband's. Telworthy's.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>gently</i>). If I belong to anybody but myself, I think I
belong to you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Not in the eyes of the Law. Not in the eyes of the Church. Not
even in the eyes of&ndash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. The County?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>annoyed</i>). I was about to say "Heaven."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rising and crossing below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>to</i> C.). That
this should happen to <i>us</i>!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>works in silence. Then she shakes out her curtains</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>looking at them</i>). I do hope Jacko will like these.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>turning and seeing curtains</i>). What! You&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Going up
to her quickly and taking her by the hands raises her from the
settee</i>.) Olivia, Olivia, have you no heart?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Ought you to talk like that to another man's wife?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Confound it, is this just a joke to you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You must forgive me, George; I am a little over-excited&ndash;at the
thought of returning to Jacob.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Do you <i>want</i> to return to him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. One wants to do what is right. In the eyes of&ndash;er&ndash;Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Seeing what sort of a man he is, I have no doubt that you could
get a separation, supposing that he didn't&ndash;er&ndash;divorce you. I don't
know <i>what</i> is best. I must consult my solicitor. The whole
position has been sprung on us, and (<i>miserably sits on stool</i>
L.C.) I don't know, I don't know. I can't take it all in. (<i>Leaning
forward and burying his face in his hands</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Wouldn't you like to consult your Aunt Julia too? She could
tell you what the County&ndash;I mean what Heaven really thought about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes, yes. Aunt Julia has plenty of common sense. You're quite
right, Olivia. This isn't a thing we can keep from the family.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Do I still call her <i>Aunt</i> Julia?</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>comes in from staircase up</i> R. <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>does not see her,
but</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>attracts his attention</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>looking up at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). What? What? (<i>Rising and
crossing up to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>.) Well, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Mr. Pim says he will come down at once, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Oh, thank you, thank you.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>picks up curtains.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>goes out up staircase up</i>
R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. George, Mr. Pim has got to know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I don't see the necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Not even for me? When a woman suddenly hears that her long-lost
husband is restored to her, don't you think she wants to ask questions?
Where is he living, and how is he looking, and&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>very angry, going to writing-table, sits</i>). Of course, if
you are interested in these things&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. How can I help being? Don't be so silly, George. (<i>Moves up
to</i> R. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>with the curtains on her arm</i>.) We
<i>must</i> know what Jacko&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>annoyed</i>) I wish you wouldn't call him by that ridiculous
name.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. My husband&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>wincing</i>). Yes, well&ndash;your husband?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, we must know his plans&ndash;where we can communicate with
him, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I have no wish to communicate with him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I'm afraid you'll have to, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I don't see the necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, you'll want to&ndash;to apologize to him for living with his
wife for so long. (<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>looks up and round at her nonplussed</i>).
And as I belong to him, he ought to be told where he can&ndash;call for me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>after a struggle and scratching his head</i>). You put it in
a very peculiar way, but I see your point. (<i>With a shudder</i>.) Oh,
the horrible publicity of it all! (<i>Turns away and leans on writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>going up to him and comforting him, placing her hands on his
shoulders</i>). Poor George. Dear, don't think I don't sympathize with
you. I understand so exactly what you are feeling. The publicity! It's
terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>miserably and turning in his chair to her</i>). I want to do
what's right. You believe that, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Of course I do. (<i>Taking her hands away</i>.) It's only that
we don't quite agree as to what is right and what is wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. It isn't a question of agreeing. Right is right, and wrong is
wrong, all the world over.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>with a sad little smile</i>). But more particularly in
Buckinghamshire, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. If I only considered myself, I should say: "Let us pack this
man Telworthy back to Australia. He would make no claim. He would
accept money to go away and say nothing about it." If I consulted
simply my own happiness, Olivia, that, is what I should say. But when I
consult&ndash;er&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>with great feeling</i>). Mine?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. My conscience&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>disappointed</i>). Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Then I can't do it. (<i>Rises and is going up</i> L.) It's
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>making her first appeal</i>). Yes; but, George, don't you
think I'm worth a little&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>turning round, seeing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>coming</i>). H'sh! Dinah!
(<i>Moves back to writing-table. Loudly for</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah's</span>
<i>benefit</i>.) Well, then I'll write to him and&ndash;Ah, Dinah, where's
Aunt Julia?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>coming in from up</i> L.). We've seen the pigs, and now she's
discussing the Art of Landseer with Brian. (<i>Crossing in front of
writing-table to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) I just came to ask&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Dinah, dear, bring Aunt Julia here. And Brian too. We have
things we want to talk about with you all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Right-o! (<i>Moves back up</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>outraged</i>). Olivia!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>turning on terrace</i>). What fun!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>goes to table</i> L.C. <i>and picks up her work-box.
Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Olivia, you don't seriously suggest that we should discuss
these things with a child like Dinah and a young man like Strange, a
mere acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Dinah will have to know. I'm very fond of her, George. You
can't send me away without telling Dinah. And Brian is my friend.
(<i>Moving to cabinet, puts curtains and work-box on top of
cabinet</i>.) You have your solicitor and your aunt and your conscience
to consult&ndash;mayn't I even have Brian?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>forgetting</i>). I should have thought that your
<i>husband</i>&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>coming down to</i> L. <i>back end of settee</i> L.). Yes,
but we don't know where Jacko is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I was not referring to&ndash;er&ndash;Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Oh, of course&ndash;You&ndash;naturally I&ndash;Oh, this is horrible! (<i>Sits
with his face in his hands at writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>is about to speak to him as</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>enters from
up</i> L. <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>looks at</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>, <i>then moves down to
centre.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>follows and comes to</i> L. <i>back end of
settee.</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>follows</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>and comes to back of
table</i> L.C. <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>moves round to</i> L. <i>end of settee</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>after a pause</i>). George and I have had some rather bad
news, Aunt Julia. We wanted your advice. Where will you sit?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Thank you, Olivia. I can sit down by myself.</p>

<p>(<i>She does so, on lower end of settee</i> R., <i>moving cushion
away</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>). You sit there, my darling.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>sits in arm-chair down</i> L. <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>on
settee</i> L. <i>There is a good pause</i>. <span class="smallcaps">All</span> <i>are looking very
uncomfortable</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Well, what is it?</p>

<p>(<i>Another pause</i>. <span class="smallcaps">All</span> <i>are still looking very
uncomfortable</i>.)</p>

<p>Money, I suppose; nobody's safe nowadays.</p>

<p>(<i>There is another good pause</i>. <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>looks up hopelessly
at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>moves up inquisitively towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>,
<i>who turns and gradually raising his head catches sight of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>
<i>and gives him a severe look and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>retreats quickly to
back of</i> L.C. <i>table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>signalling for help</i>). Olivia&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>after a pause</i>). We've just heard that my first husband
is still alive.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Telworthy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Good Lord!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. George!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). And only this morning I was saying that
nothing ever happened in this house! (<i>Rising from arm-chair and
sitting to</i> L. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and remorsefully to her</i>.)
Darling, I don't mean that. Darling one!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. What does this mean, George? I leave you for ten minutes&ndash;barely ten minutes&ndash;to go and look at the pigs, and when I come back
you tell me that Olivia is a bigamist.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>jumps up and moves to</i> L. <i>of settee</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>indignantly advancing towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>). I say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>restraining him</i>). H'sh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and taking her hand across table</i> L.C.).
If this is a row, I'm on your side.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Well, George?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rising and coming down to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>). I'm afraid it's
true, Aunt Julia. (<i>Taking stool from</i> L.C. <i>to</i> C., <i>sits
on it</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>sits in arm-chair down</i> L.) We heard the news
just before lunch&ndash;just before you came. We've only this moment had an
opportunity of talking about it, of wondering what to do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. What was his name&mdash;&mdash;Tel&ndash;something&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Jacob Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>in amazement</i>). So he's alive still?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Apparently. There seems to be no doubt about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Didn't you <i>see</i> him die? I should
always want to <i>see</i> my husband die before I married again. Not
that I approve of second marriages, anyhow. I told you so at the time,
George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. <i>And</i> me, Aunt Julia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Did I? Well, I generally say what I think.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I ought to tell you, Aunt Julia, that no blame attaches to
Olivia over this. Of that I am perfectly satisfied. It's nobody's
fault, except&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Except Telworthy's. <i>He</i> seems to have been rather
careless. Well, what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. That's just it. It's a terrible situation (<i>With a gesture of
despair</i>.) There's bound to be so much publicity. Not only all this,
but&ndash;but Telworthy's past.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. I should have said that it was Telworthy's present which,
was the trouble. Had he a past as well?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. He was a fraudulent company promoter. He went to prison a good
deal.</p>

<p>(<i>General consternation</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>gives a long whistle and goes
up</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. George, you never told me this!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I&ndash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I don't see <i>why</i> he should want to talk about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>indignantly rising and moving to L. end of settee</i> L.).
What's it got to do with Olivia, anyhow? It's not <i>her</i> fault.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>sarcastically and emphatically</i>). Oh, no, I daresay
it's mine.</p>

<p>(<i>There is an uncomfortable pause</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). You wanted to ask Aunt Julia what was the
right thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>crossing down L.C. and bursting out</i>). Good Heavens, what
is there to do except the one and only thing? (<i>They all look at him
and he becomes embarrassed and backs up stage a little</i>.) I'm sorry.
You don't want <i>me</i> to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>taking his hand across table</i> L.C.). <i>I</i> do, Brian.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Well, go on, Mr. Strange. What would <i>you</i> do in
George's position?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>crosses down to back of table</i> L.C.). Do? Say to the woman
I loved, "You're <i>mine</i> (<i>bangs table with his fist</i>), and
let this other damned fellow come and take you from me if he can!" And
he couldn't&ndash;how could he?&ndash;not if the woman chose <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>gazes at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>in amazement</i>, <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>in
anger</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>presses his hand gratefully. He has said what she
has been waiting&ndash;oh, so eagerly&ndash;for</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>to say</i>. <span class="smallcaps">George</span>
<i>rises and goes angrily up to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>who defies him</i>.
<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>is subdued and moves helplessly up</i> C. <i>followed by</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>who is still defiant</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>rises and runs up</i> L.
<i>and round back of settee</i> L. <i>and up to left of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>
<i>and takes his arm</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>adoringly</i>). Oh, Brian! (<i>In a loud whisper</i>.) It
<i>is</i> me, isn't it, and not Olivia?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. You baby, of course!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. I'm afraid, Mr. Strange (<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>with an exclamation of
annoyance comes down to</i> L. <i>of settee</i> L.), your morals are as
peculiar as your views on Art.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>down to back of table</i> L.C.). This is not a question of
morals or of art, it's a question of love.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Hear, hear!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). Isn't it that girl's bed-time yet?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>and taking her hand</i>). We'll let her sit
up a little longer if she's good.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. I will be good, Olivia (<i>aggressively to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>),
only I thought anybody, however important a debate was, was allowed to
say "Hear, hear!"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coming down</i> C.). Really, Olivia, I really think we could
discuss this better if Mr. Strange took Dinah out for a walk. Strange,
If you&ndash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Tell them what you have settled first, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Settled? What is there to be settled? It settles itself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>sadly</i>). That's just it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. The marriage must be annulled&ndash;is that the word, George?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I presume so. (<i>Sits on stool</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. One's solicitor will know all about that, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. And when the marriage has been annulled, what then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Presumably Olivia will return to her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>bitterly to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>). And <i>that's</i> morality! As
expounded by Bishop Landseer!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>angered, rising and facing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). I don't know what you
mean by Bishop Landseer. Morality is acting in accordance with the Laws
of the Land and the Laws of the Church. I am quite prepared to believe
that your creed embraces neither marriage (<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>gives a little cry
and bangs a cushion on settee angrily</i>) nor monogamy, but my creed
is different.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>fiercely</i>). My creed includes both marriage and monogamy,
and monogamy means sticking to the woman you love, as long as she wants
you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>calmly</i>). You suggest that George and Olivia should
go on living together, although they have never been legally married.
Bless the man, what do you think the County would say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>scornfully</i>). Does it matter?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Well, if you really want to know, the men would say, "Gad, she's
a fine woman; I don't wonder he sticks to her," and the women would
say, "I can't <i>think</i> what he sees in her to stick to her like
that," and they'd both say, "After all, he may be a damn fool, but you
can't deny he's a sportsman."</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>is very indignant</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Was it for this sort of thing Olivia, that
you insisted on having Dinah and Mr. Strange in here? To insult me in
my own house?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. I can't think what young people are coming to nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I think, dear, you and Brian had better go.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>getting up</i>). We will go. (<i>Crossing below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>
<i>and putting her knee on stool and looking cheekily up into</i>
<span class="smallcaps">George</span>'s <i>face</i>.) But I'm just going to say one thing, Uncle
George. Brian and I <i>are</i> going to marry each other, and when we
are married we'll stick to each other, however many of our dead
husbands and wives turn up! Come on, Brian. (<i>She goes up</i> C.
<i>and through window and goes out indignantly, followed by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>
R.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>follows them up</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Upon my word, this is a pleasant discussion.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I think the discussion is over, George. It is only a question
of where I shall go, while you are bringing your&ndash;what sort of suit did
you call it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). Nullity suit. I suppose that <i>is</i>
the best thing?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. It's horrible. (<i>Moving down between stool and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>.) The awful publicity. That it should be happening to <i>us</i>,
that's what I can't get over.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. I don't remember anything of the sort in the Marden Family
before, ever.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>absently</i>). Lady Fanny.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>recollecting</i>). Yes, of course; but that was two
hundred years ago. The standards were different then. (<i>Rising and
going up</i> C. <i>to</i> R.) Besides, it wasn't quite the same,
anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>absently</i>). No, it wasn't quite the same.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>R. of writing-table</i>). No. We shall all feel it.
Terribly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>his apology</i>). If there were any other way! Olivia, what
<i>can</i> I do? It <i>is</i> the only way, isn't it? All that that
fellow said&ndash;of course, it sounds very well&ndash;but as things are....
(<i>Crossing towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) <i>Is</i> there anything in marriage,
or isn't there? You believe that there is, don't you? You aren't one of
these Socialists. Well, then, <i>can</i> we go on living together when
you're another man's wife? It isn't only what people will say, but it
<i>is</i> wrong, isn't it?.... And supposing he doesn't divorce you,
are we to go on living together, unmarried, for <i>ever</i>? (<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>turns and listens</i>.) Olivia, you seem to think that I'm
just thinking of the publicity&ndash;what people will say. I'm not. I'm not.
That comes in any way. But I want to do what's right, what's best. I
don't mean what's best for us, what makes us happiest, I mean what's
really best, what's rightest. What anybody else would do in my place.
(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>holds out her hands lovingly towards him</i>.) <i>I</i>
don't know. It's so unfair. You're not my wife at all, but I want to do
what's right.... (<i>Sits foot of table</i> L.C.) Oh, Olivia, Olivia,
you do understand, don't you?</p>

<p>(<i>They have both forgotten</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>has never taken
her eyes off him as he makes his last attempt to convince himself</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>almost tenderly</i>). So very, very well, George. Oh, I
understand just what you are feeling. And oh, I do so wish that you
could&ndash;(<i>with a little sigh</i>)&ndash;but then it wouldn't be George, not
the George I married&ndash;(<i>with a rueful little laugh</i>)&ndash;or didn't
quite marry.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. I must say, I think you are both talking a little wildly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>repeating it, oh, so tenderly</i>). Or didn't&ndash;quite&ndash;marry.</p>

<p>(<i>She looks at him with all her heart in her eyes. She is giving him
his last chance to say "Damn Telworthy; you're mine!" He rises and
crosses to</i> R. <i>He struggles desperately with himself, turns
to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Olivia! Olivia! My darling!</p>

<p>(<i>She rises. He crosses to her and takes her in his arms</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>enters from double doors</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Mr. Pim is here, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>prompting him</i>). Mr. Pim, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>emerging from the struggle with an effort</i>). Pim? Pim?
Oh, ah, yes, of course. (<i>Crossing up to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>.) Mr. Pim.
(<i>Looking up</i>.) Where have you put him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I want to see Mr. Pim, too, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>coming down</i> C. <i>to</i> R. <i>of table</i> L.C.).
Who on earth is Mr. Pim?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Show him in here, Anne. (<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>comes back to</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Yes, madam.</p>

<p>(<i>She goes out double doors</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. It was Mr. Pim who told us about my husband. He came across
with him in the boat, and recognized him as the Telworthy he knew in
Australia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Oh! Shall I be in the way? (<i>Moving down to</i> R.C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. No, no. It doesn't matter, does it, Olivia?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Please stay.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>sits</i> R. <i>settee</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Anne</span> <i>enters at double doors followed by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Anne</span>. Mr. Pim.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>pulling himself together</i>). Ah, Mr. Pim! Very good of you
to have come.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, not at all!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. The fact is&ndash;er&ndash;(<i>It is too much for him; he looks
despairingly at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. We're so sorry to trouble you, Mr. Pim. By the way, do you know
Lady Marden?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>centre</i>). No, I haven't the honour.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>introducing</i>). My Aunt! Mr. Pim.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>bow to each other</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Do come and sit down, won't you? (<i>Pim is moving to</i> L.,
<i>turns and bumps into</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>, <i>who is following him. She makes
room for him on the sofa next to her</i>.) The fact is, Mr. Pim, you
gave us rather a surprise this morning, and before we had time to
realize what it all meant, you had gone.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. A surprise, Mrs. Marden? Dear me, not an unpleasant one, I hope?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, rather a&ndash;surprising one. (<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>coughs</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>Pim sits to</i> R. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>, <i>who takes his hat and
places it to her</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>turns to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>). Olivia, allow me a moment. Mr.
Pim, you mentioned a man called Telworthy this morning. My wife used to
(<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>gives a pronounced cough</i>)&ndash;that is to say, I used
to&ndash;that is, there are reasons&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I think we had better be perfectly frank, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>aggressively</i>). I am sixty-five years of age, Mr.
Pim, and I can say that I've never had a moment's uneasiness by
(<i>beating her knee with her hand, stick in left hand</i>) telling the
truth.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>fix each other with a look</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>
<i>then looks at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>and leans back on
settee</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>after a desperate effort to keep up with the conversation</i>).
Oh!... I&ndash;er&ndash;I'm afraid I am rather at sea. Have I&ndash;er&ndash;left anything
unsaid in presenting my credentials to you this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. This Telworthy whom you mention&ndash;I seem to remember the name&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Mr. Pim, you told us this morning of a man whom you had met on
the boat, a man who had come down in the world, whom you had known in
Sydney. A man called Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>relieved</i>). Ah, yes, yes, of course. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) I
did say Telworthy, didn't I? Most curious coincidence, Lady Marden.
Poor man, poor man! Let me see, it must have been ten years ago&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Just a moment, Mr. Pim. You're quite sure that his name was
Telworthy?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). Telworthy&ndash;Telworthy&ndash;didn't I say Telworthy?
Yes, that was it&ndash;Telworthy. Poor fellow!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I'm going to be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Pim. I feel quite
sure that I can trust you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, Mrs. Marden!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. This man Telworthy whom you met is my husband.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Your husband! (<i>He looks in mild surprise at</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>.) Your&ndash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. My first husband. His death was announced six years ago. I had
left him some years before that, but there seems no doubt from your
story that he's still alive. His record&ndash;the country he comes from&ndash;above all, the very unusual name&ndash;Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Telworthy&ndash;yes&ndash;certainly a most peculiar name. I remember saying
so. Your first husband? Dear me! Dear me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You understand, Mr. Pim, that all this is in absolute
confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). Of course, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>pulling his arm, trying to attract his attention</i>). Well,
since he is my husband, we naturally want to know something about him.
Where is he now, for instance?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>surprised and turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Where is he now? But
surely I told you? I told you what happened at Marseilles?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. At Marseilles?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). Yes, yes, poor fellow, it was most unfortunate.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>again pulls his arm, trying to
attract his attention</i>.) You must understand, Lady Marden, that
although I had met the poor fellow before in Australia, I was never in
any way intimate&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>thumping the desk</i>). Where is he <i>now</i>, that's what
we want to know?</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span> <i>turns to him with a start</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Please, Mr. Pim!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Where is he now? But&ndash;but didn't I tell you of
the curious fatality at Marseilles&ndash;poor fellow&ndash;the fish-bone?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">All</span>. Fish-bone?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Yes, yes, a herring, I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>becoming hysterical</i>). Do you mean he's dead?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Dead&ndash;of course he's dead. He's been dead&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>laughing hysterically</i>). Oh, Mr. Pim, you&ndash;oh, what a
husband to have&ndash;oh, I&mdash;&mdash;(<i>But that is all she can say for the
moment</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Pull yourself together, Olivia. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>.) So he
really is dead this time?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, undoubtedly, undoubtedly. A fish-bone lodged in his throat.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>retreats to settee</i> R. <i>again</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>moving up</i> C. <i>to</i> L. <i>window, trying to realize
it</i>). Dead! Dead!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>rising and turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>, <i>alarmed at her
hysteria</i>). Oh, but, Mrs. Marden!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I think you must excuse me, Mr. Pim. (<i>Crossing to</i> C.)
But a herring! There's something about a herring&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>comes quickly to her, very concerned</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>is also very concerned</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>.) Oh, George! (<i>Shaking her head in a weak
state of laughter, turns to</i> R. <i>and is about to hurry out of the

<i>hysteria</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Dead! Dead!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh dear! Oh dear! I'm afraid I broke the news rather hastily. The
double shock of losing one husband and being restored to another&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>coming to</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). A dispensation of Providence,
George. One can regard it in no other light. (<i>Moves to</i> R. <i>of
writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coming to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>). Yes! Yes! Well, I'm much obliged to you,
Mr. Pim, for having come down to us this afternoon, and you understand
that your news, though tardy, has been very welcome. <i>De Mortuis</i>,
and so forth.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>crosses at back of writing-table to</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>sadly repeating</i>). <i>De Mortuis&ndash;</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>shaking hands&ndash;anxious to get rid of him</i>). Well, good-bye, and again our thanks.</p>

<p>(<i>Crosses below and to</i> L. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>and rings bell below

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>crossing to centre</i>). Not at all. I shouldn't have broken
the news so hastily. (<i>Catches sight of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>up</i> L.,
<i>and with a profound bow</i>.) Good-bye, Lady Marden.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>equally profound</i>). Good-bye, Mr. Pim.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. I'm afraid I broke the news too hastily. (<i>Goes to table</i>
B.C. <i>and takes up</i> <span class="smallcaps">George's</span> <i>cap in mistake for his hat and is

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Mr. Pim, excuse me, but I think this is yours.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>he takes it and looks at it closely, comparing it with the

<p>No, that isn't my hat. (<i>Takes his own hat from</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>.) This is
my hat. Good-bye! (<i>Shakes hands</i>.) Thank you so much. (<i>Looking
at cap on table</i>.) Oh, no! Oh, no! (<i>Moves nearer to door</i> R.)
Telworthy... I <i>think</i> that was the name.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit doors</i> R.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>, <i>annoyed at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim's</span> <i>stupidity, comes down to</i>
L. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> <i>and with a sigh of
thankfulness</i>). Well, this is wonderful news, Aunt Julia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. Most providential. Well, I must be getting along now,
George. Say good-bye to Olivia for me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>crossing towards double-doors as if to open them</i>). Good-bye, Aunt Julia.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span>. No! No! I'll go this way&ndash;(<i>going up to</i> L. <i>of
writing-table</i>)&ndash;and get Olivia out more, George. I don't like these
hysterics. (<i>Banging writing-table</i>.) You want to be firmer with
her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes! Yes! Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Marden</span> (<i>going off up</i> L.). Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>back again down centre and with great thankfulness</i>).
Dead! Dead! (<i>Moves down to below settee</i> L.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>enters from staircase, watching him and coming quietly

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>approaching her enthusiastically</i>). Olivia! Olivia!
(<i>Is about to embrace her, but she restrains him</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>drawing herself up</i>). Mrs. Telworthy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>taken aback</i>). What? Olivia! I&ndash;I don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, darling, if my husband only died at Marseilles a few days
ago&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>scratching his head</i>). Yes, I see&ndash;I see. Well, we can
soon put that right. (<i>Moving to</i> L.) A registry office in London.
Better go up this afternoon. We can't do these things too quickly&ndash;we
can stay at an hotel.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>pointedly</i>). You and Mrs. Telworthy! (<i>Moves slowly
round back of settee</i> L.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>moves to centre</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>nonplussed</i>). Oh&ndash;er&ndash;yes&ndash;yes&ndash;perhaps I'd better stay
at my Club&ndash;yes! It will be a bit awkward at first. (<i>With a sigh of
relief</i>.) However, nobody need know, and how much better than what
we feared!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>comes down to below settee</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>advancing to embrace her</i>). Olivia! Olivia!</p>

<p>(<i>She repulses him and he crosses to her</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Mrs. Telworthy!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes&ndash;yes, I know, but why do you keep on saying it? What's the
matter with you? You're so strange to-day. You're not like the Olivia I
know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>sits on settee to</i> R.). Perhaps you don't know me so very
well, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>sitting&ndash;affectionately to her</i> L.). Oh, that's nonsense&ndash;old girl. You're just my Olivia. Now we can get married again quietly
and nobody will be any the worse.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Married again! Oh, I see, you want me to marry you at a
registry office to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. If we can arrange it by then. (<i>Rising and crossing below</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>to centre</i>.) I don't know how long these things take, but
I should imagine there would be no difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, no, I think that part of it ought to be quite <i>easy</i>.
But&ndash;(<i>She hesitates</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. But what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, if you want to marry me to-morrow, George, oughtn't you
to propose to me first?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>amazed</i>). Propose?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes. It is usual, isn't it, to propose to a person before you
marry her? And&ndash;and we want to do the usual thing, don't we?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>upset</i>). But you&ndash;I mean we&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You are George Marden, I am Olivia Telworthy, you are attracted
by me and think I would make you a good wife, and you want to marry me&ndash;very well, then, naturally you propose to me first.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>falling into the humour of it, as he thinks, and with a
hearty laugh moves to below stool</i> L.C.). The baby! Did she want to
be proposed to all over again?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>coyly</i>). Well, she did rather.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rather fancying himself as an actor, he adopts what he
considers to be an appropriate attitude</i>). She shall then. Er&ndash;ah,
Mrs. Telworthy, I have long admired you in silence, and the time has
now come to put my admiration into words (<i>but apparently he finds a
difficulty</i>)&ndash;er&ndash;er&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>looking up at him quizzically and prompting him into words;
repeating</i>). I&ndash;I&ndash;(<i>Looking down coyly</i>.) Oh, Mr. Marden!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>roars with laughter and crosses to centre</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>returning to her</i>). Olivia&ndash;er&ndash;may I call you Olivia?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes, George.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>puts out her hand and</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>notices it</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I beg your pardon! Oh, I see. (<i>Taking her hand in his he
gives it a good slap and she winces</i>.) Olivia, I&ndash;(<i>Hesitates</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I don't want to interrupt, but oughtn't you to be on your
knees? It is&ndash;usual, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Really, Olivia, you must allow me to manage my own proposal in
my own way.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>meekly&ndash;and resuming her coyness</i>). I'm sorry. Do go on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well&ndash;er&ndash;confound it, Olivia, I love you. Will you marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Thank you, George, I will think it over.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Silly girl. (<i>Pats her on the shoulder and
crosses to</i> R.) Well, then, to-morrow morning. No wedding cake, I'm
afraid, Olivia. (<i>He laughs again and moves up centre</i>.) But we'll
go and have a good lunch somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I will think it over, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>good-humouredly and coming down to back of settee to her</i>
R.). Well, give me a kiss while you're thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I'm afraid you mustn't kiss me until we are actually engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>laughing uneasily, and sitting and leaning over on table</i>
L.C. <i>towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Oh, we needn't take it as seriously as all
that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But a woman must take a proposal seriously.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>a little alarmed at last</i>). What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, what I mean is that the whole question&ndash;(<i>with a sly
look at</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>)&ndash;as I heard somebody say once, demands much more
anxious thought than either of us has given it. These hasty marriages&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rising and crossing at back of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>round settee
and to</i> L. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Hasty!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, you've only just proposed to me, and you want me to marry
you to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Now you're talking perfect nonsense, Olivia. You know quite
well that our case is utterly different from&ndash;well&ndash;from any other.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. All the same, one must ask oneself questions. With a young girl
like&ndash;well, with a young girl&ndash;love may well seem to be all that
matters. But with a woman of my age it is different. I have to ask
myself whether you can afford to support a wife.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You know perfectly well that I can afford to support a wife as
my wife should be supported.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, I am glad. Then your income&ndash;you are not really worried
about that at all?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>stiffly</i>). You know perfectly well what my income is. I
see no reason for anxiety, in the future.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Ah, very well, then we needn't think about it any more.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You know I can't make out what you're up to. (<i>Sits to
her</i> L. <i>on settee</i>.) Don't you want to get married&ndash;to&ndash;er&ndash;legalize this extraordinary situation in which we are placed?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I must consider the whole question very carefully. I can't just
jump at the very first offer I have had since my husband died.
(<i>Rising and crossing to centre</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Oh, so I'm under consideration, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>moving up</i> R.C.). Every suitor is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Oh, very well, go on! Go on!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well then, there's your niece. You have a niece living with
you. Of course Dinah is a delightful girl, but one doesn't like
marrying into a household where there's another grown-up woman. But
perhaps she will be getting married herself soon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I see no prospect of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. It would make it so much easier, George, if she did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>rising</i>). Is this a threat, Olivia? (<i>Crossing up
to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>.) Are you telling me that if I do not allow young Strange
to marry Dinah, you will not marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. A threat? Oh, no, George. But I was just wondering if you love
me as much as Brian loves Dinah. You do love me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>from his heart</i>). Of course I do, old girl.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You're sure it's not just my pretty face that attracts you.
Love which is based upon mere outward appearances cannot result in
lasting happiness&ndash;as one of our thinkers has observed. (<i>Moving down
to settee</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Why should you doubt my love? You can't pretend that we haven't
been happy together. (<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>sits on settee</i> R.) I've&ndash;(<i>taking
a chair from</i> L. <i>of table</i> R.C. <i>brings it down to</i> L.
<i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>) I've been a good pal to you, eh? We&ndash;we suit each
other, old girl.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Do we?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>sitting</i>). Well, of course we do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I wonder. When two people of our age think of getting married,
one wants to be quite sure that there is real community of ideas
between them. Supposing that after we have been married some years we
found ourselves getting estranged from each other upon such questions
as Dinah's future, or the comparatively trivial matter like the right
colour for a curtain, or the advice to be given to a friend who had
innocently contracted a bigamous marriage. Think how bitterly we should
regret our hasty plunge into a matrimony which was no true partnership,
whether of tastes or ideas or even of consciences. (<i>With a
sigh</i>.) Ah me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>turning to her quickly</i>). Unfortunately for your
argument, Olivia, I can answer you out of your own mouth. You seem to
have&ndash;(<i>laughing</i>)&ndash;forgotten what you said this morning in the
case of&ndash;er&ndash;young Strange.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>with exaggerated reproach</i>). Oh, but is it quite fair,
George, to drag up <i>what was said this morning</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>enjoying his apparent success</i>). Ha ha! You've brought it
on yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I?... Well, and what did I say this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You said that it was quite enough that Strange was n gentleman
and in love with Dinah for me to let them marry each other.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh! But is that enough, George?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>triumphantly</i>). Well, you said so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>meekly</i>). Well, George, if you think so too, I'm quite
willing to risk it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>kindly, rising and putting back chair up</i> R.C.). Ha ha,
my dear! You see!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Then you <i>do</i> think it's enough?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I&ndash;er&ndash;yes, yes, I&ndash;I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>rising and going to him and putting her hands on his
shoulders</i>). My darling one! How jolly! Then we can have a double
wedding.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>astonished</i>). A double one!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes, you and me, Brian and Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>firmly, and taking her hands from his shoulders</i>). Now
look here, Olivia, understand once and for all, I am not to be
blackmailed into giving my consent to Dinah's engagement. Neither
blackmailed nor tricked. (<i>Crossing to</i> L. <i>below settee</i>.)
Our marriage has nothing whatever to do with Dinah's.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. No, dear, I quite understand. They may take place about the
same time, but they have nothing whatever to do with each other.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>sits on foot of table</i> L.C.). I see no prospect of
Dinah's marriage taking place for many years.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. No, dear, that was what I said.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>not understanding for the moment</i>). You said&mdash;&mdash;? I see.
(<i>Turning and facing her</i>.) Now look here, Olivia, let us have
this perfectly clear. You apparently insist on treating my&ndash;er&ndash;proposal as serious.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>mock surprise</i>). But isn't it? Have you been trifling
with me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You know perfectly well what I mean. You treat it as an
ordinary proposal for a man to a woman who have never been anything to
each other before. Very well then, will you kindly tell me what you
propose to do if you decide to&ndash;ah&ndash;accept me? You do not suggest that
we should go on living together&ndash;unmarried?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>shocked</i>). Of course not, George!! What would&ndash;(<i>pausing for additional explanation</i>)&ndash;the County&ndash;I mean Heaven&ndash;I mean the Law&ndash;I mean&ndash;of course not. Besides, it's so unnecessary.
If I decide to accept you, of <i>course</i> I shall marry you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Quite so. And if you&ndash;ah&ndash;decide to refuse me, what will you
do?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Meaning by that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Just that, George. I shall stay here&ndash;just as before.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>rises and approaches her, about to expostulate</i>.)</p>

<p>I like this house. (<i>Crossing below</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>, <i>looking about the
room to below settee</i> L.) It wants a little redecorating, but I do
like it, George... Yes, I shall be perfectly happy here! (<i>Sits on
settee</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. I see. You will continue to live down here&ndash;in spite of what
you said just now about the&ndash;the immorality of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>surprised</i>). But what is there immoral in a widow living
alone in a big country house&ndash;with perhaps the niece of a dear friend
of hers&ndash;staying with her to keep her company.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>sarcastic</i>). Oh, and pray what shall I be doing when
you've so very kindly taken possession of my house for me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You! Oh, I can't <i>think</i>! Travelling, I expect.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>indignant and advancing to her</i>). Thank you! And suppose
I refuse to be turned out of my own house?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Then, seeing that we can't both be in it, it looks as though
you'd have to turn me out. (<i>To herself</i>.) There must be legal
ways of doing these things. You'd have to consult your solicitor again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Legal ways?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, you couldn't just throw me out, could you? You'd have to
get an injunction against me&ndash;</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span>, <i>very annoyed, turns away</i>.)</p>

<p>&ndash;or prosecute me for trespass&ndash;or something. Of course I shouldn't go
if I could help it, I like the house so much.... It would make an
awfully unusual case, wouldn't it? The papers would be full of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. The papers!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>calling as paper boy</i>). Extra special! Widow of well-known ex-convict takes possession of J.P.'s house! Special! Special!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>angrily</i>). I've had enough of this. (<i>Coming to
table</i> L.C. <i>and speaking across</i>.) Do you mean all this
nonsense?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, what I <i>do</i> mean <i>is</i>, that I am in no hurry to
go up to London and get married. I love the country just now, and&ndash;(<i>with a sigh</i>)&ndash;after this morning, I'm&ndash;rather tired of
husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>in a rage</i>). I've never heard so much&ndash;damned (<i>bangs
table</i>) ... nonsense in my life. <i>I will leave you to come back to
your senses.</i></p>

<p>(<i>He goes out, up staircase up</i> R.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>rises and crosses to centre, watching</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>off. She
kisses her hands to him, then turning to</i> L. <i>sees curtains and
work-box and extending her arms in ecstasy goes to cabinet, takes them
up and comes down</i> L. <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>sits on settee with curtains in her
lap and places the work-box to her</i> L. <i>on settee, and as she does
so</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span> <i>enters from up</i> R. <i>through windows and coming
to</i> R. <i>of writing-table taps it with his umbrella to attract</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Olivia's</span> <i>attention. She turns and sees him. He looks nervously round
at staircase</i> R. <i>fearing the return of</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>in a whisper</i>). Er&ndash;may I come in, Mrs. Marden?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>in surprise</i>). Mr. Pim!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>anxiously and again looking round at staircase</i>). Mr. Marden
is&ndash;er&ndash;not here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>getting up</i>). No! Do you want to see him? I will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>another look round at staircase and moving down centre</i>).
No, no, no! Not for the world. There is no immediate danger of his
returning, Mrs. Marden?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>surprised</i>). No, I don't think so, Mr. Pim. (<i>Puts down
curtains</i>). But... what is it? You&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. I took the liberty of returning by the window in the hope of
finding you alone.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>sitting again</i>). Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>still rather nervous and throwing up his arms in distress</i>).
Mr. Marden will be so angry with me, and very rightly. Oh, I blame
myself. I blame myself entirely. I don't know how I can have been so
stupid. (<i>Sits on stool</i> L.C. <i>very concerned</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. What is it, Mr. Pim? My first husband hasn't come to life
again, has he?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No! No! No! (<i>Looking round to</i> R. <i>and speaking very
mysteriously across table</i> L.C.) The fact is&ndash;his name was
Pelwittle.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>at a loss</i>). Whose? My husband's?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Yes, yes. Henry Pelwittle, poor fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But <i>my</i> husband's name was Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No! Oh dear, no! Pelwittle. (<i>Firmly</i>.) It came back to me
suddenly just as I reached the gate&ndash;Henry Pelwittle, poor fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But really, Mr. Pim, I ought to know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No! No! Pelwittle.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But who is Pelwittle?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>in surprise at her stupidity</i>). The man I told you about,
who met with the sad fatality at Marseilles. Henry Pelwittle....
(<i>With hand on chin, thinking deeply</i>.) Or was it <i>Ernest</i>?
No! <i>Henry</i> Pelwittle, poor fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). But, Mr. Pim, you said his name was
Telworthy. How could you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, I blame myself, I blame myself entirely.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. But how could you <i>think</i> of a name like Telworthy if it
wasn't Telworthy?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). Ah, ah, that is the really interesting thing
about the whole matter.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>). Yes, Mr. Pim, all your visits here to-day have been very interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, very interesting, very interesting, You see, Mrs. Marden, when
I made my first appearance here this morning I was received by&ndash;Miss
Diana, who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Dinah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Dinah. Her name is Dinah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>pauses</i>). You're quite right. Dinah&ndash;oh yes. Miss Dinah,
yes. She was in&ndash;er&ndash;rather a communicative mood, and I suppose by way
of passing the time she mentioned that before your marriage&ndash;to Mr.
Marden you had been a Mrs.&ndash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Telworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Telworthy, yes, of course. She also mentioned Australia. Now by
some curious process of the brain&ndash;which strikes me as decidedly
curious&ndash;when I was trying to recollect&ndash;the name of the poor fellow on
the boat, whom you will remember I had also met in Australia, the fact
that this other name was also stored in my memory, a name equally
peculiar&ndash;this fact I say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>seeing that the sentence is rapidly going to pieces</i>).
Yes, I quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. I blame myself, I blame myself entirely.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, you mustn't do that, Mr. Pim.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Oh, but, Mrs. Marden, can you forgive me for the needless distress
I have caused you to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, you mustn't worry about that, please.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. And you will tell your husband&ndash;you'll break the news to him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>amazed</i>). Oh, yes! I'll break the <i>news</i> to him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>rising and holding out his hand</i>). Well then, I think before
he comes back I will say good-bye and&ndash;er&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>rising</i>). Just a moment, Mr. Pim. Let us have it quite
clear this time. You never knew my husband Jacob Telworthy?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You never met him in Australia?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You never saw him on the boat?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. And nothing <i>whatever happened to him at Marseilles?</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. No!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Is that right?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>hesitating and thinking it out very deeply</i>). I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Very well, then, since his death was announced in Australia six
years ago, he is presumably still dead?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Undoubtedly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>holding out her hand with a charming smile</i>). Then good-bye, Mr. Pim, and thank you so much for&ndash;for all your trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> Not at all, Mrs. Marden.  I blame myself, I blame myself entirely.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> Oh!  You mustn't do that.</p>

<p>(<i>Going up centre</i> <span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>meets</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>, <i>who enters from the window
up L., crosses at back of writing-table and comes down R. of him</i>).</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> is followed by <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, who is on her R.).</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> Hullo, there's Mr. Pim.  (<i>To</i> BRIAN.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>nervously looking at the door in case</i> MR. MARDEN <i>should
come in</i>).  Yes, yes I&mdash;er&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> Oh, Mr. Pim, you mustn't run away without even saying
how-do-you-do!  Are you staying to tea?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>looking off at staircase nervously</i>). I'm afraid I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> Mr. Pim has to hurry away, Dinah. You mustn't keep him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> Well, but you'll come back again?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> I fear that I am only a passer-by, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> You can take Mr. Pim as far as the gate.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> (<i>gratefully to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Thank you. (<i>With nervous look
at staircase R., he edges towards the windows.</i>) If you would
be so kind, Miss Dinah&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>taking his arm</i>). Come along then, Mr. Pim.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> I'll catch you up.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>taking him up L.</i>). I want to hear all about your first wife.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> Oh, but I haven't got a first wife.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah.</span> You haven't really told me anything yet.</p>

<p>(<i>They go off up L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> I'll catch you up.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>resumes her work, and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>crosses down to foot of
table L.C., and sits on it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>awkwardly</i>). I just wanted to say, if you don't think it cheek,
that I'm&mdash;I'm on your side, if I may be and if I can help you at all,
I shall be very proud of being allowed to.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>looking up at him and taking his hand</i>). Brian, you dear,
that's sweet of you.  But it's quite all right now, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>  What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia.</span> Yes, that's what Mr. Pim came back to say.  He'd made a
mistake about the name&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>rising</i>). Good Lord!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>smiling</i>). George is the only husband I have.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>surprised</i>). What? You mean that the whole thing that Pim&mdash;
 
<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>repeating</i>). The whole thing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>crossing up to window R. and shouting off to L. and
with conviction</i>). Silly ass!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>kindly</i>). Oh, no, no, I'm sure he didn't mean to be.
(<i>After a pause</i>.) Brian, do you know anything about the law?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>coming down</i> C.). The law? I'm afraid not. I hate the law.
Why? (<i>Sits at foot of table</i> L.C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, I was just wondering. Suppose that George and I had
accidentally married each other a second time thinking that the first
marriage wasn't quite right, and then we found the first marriage was
all right&ndash;well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. What on earth do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, what I mean is that there's nothing wrong in marrying the
same person twice?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>rising and moving to centre, thinking it out</i>). Oh, no. A
hundred times if you like, I should think.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. After all, in France they always go through it twice, don't
they? Once before the Mayor or somebody, and once in church.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Of course they do! How silly of me. You know, that's a very
good idea. They ought to do that more in England.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Well, once will be enough for Dinah and me, if you can work it.
(<i>Anxiously</i>.) D'you think there's any chance, Olivia?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Every chance, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>coming to above table</i> L.C.). I say, do you really? Have
you squared him? I mean has he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>is heard humming the tune of "Pop goes the weasel" off</i>
R.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You go and catch them up now. We'll talk about it later on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Bless you. Right-o!</p>

<p>(<i>Going up</i> L. <i>and off up</i> L.)</p>

<p>(<i>As he goes out by the windows,</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>comes in at the
doors</i> R. <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>stands</i> R.C., <i>and then turns to</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>, <i>who is absorbed in her curtain. He walks up and down the
room, fidgeting with things, waiting for her to speak. As she says
nothing, he begins to talk himself, but in an obviously unconcerned
way. There is a pause after each answer of hers, before he gets out his
next remark</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>casually</i>). Good-looking fellow, Strange. What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>equally casually</i>). Brian, yes, isn't he? And such a nice
boy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes, yes! (<i>Catching sight of curtain she is sewing. Hums the
tune of "Pop goes the weasel"&ndash;crossing down</i> R. <i>to piano, plays
a few notes of "Pop goes the weasel" with one finger</i>.) Got fifty
pounds for a picture the other day, didn't he? (<i>Moving up stage a
little</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Ah, yes! Of course he has only just begun&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. The critics think well of him, (<i>Slight pause</i>.) What?</p>

<p>(<i>Up C. by chair front of writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. They all say he has genius. Oh, I don't think there's any doubt
about it. (<i>Pause</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>left of writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. No, no! (<i>Slight pause, and he sings again</i>.) Of course I
don't profess to know anything about painting, myself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You've never had time to take it up, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coming down</i> L. <i>a little</i>.) No! No! Of course I know what
I like. Can't say I see much in this new-fangled stuff. If a man can
paint, why can't he paint like&ndash;like Rubens, or&ndash;or Reynolds, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I suppose we all have our own styles. Brian will be finding
his, directly. Of course, he's only just beginning. (<i>Pause</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>crossing up centre</i>). Yes, yes. But the critics think a
lot of him, what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes! H'm! (<i>Pause</i>.) Good-looking fellow.</p>

<p>(<i>There is rather a longer silence this time.</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>coming
round back of settee L. continues to hope that he is appearing casual
and unconcerned&ndash;he stands looking at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia's</span> <i>work for a
moment</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>down</i> L.). Nearly finished 'em?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Very nearly. (<i>Smiling to herself, turns away to R.,
pretending to look for scissors</i>.) Have you seen my scissors
anywhere?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>looking round</i>). Scissors?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>turns to</i> L. <i>and finds them in her work-box</i>). It's
all right, here they are&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>down</i> L. <i>below chair facing</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Where are you
thinking of hanging 'em?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>as if really wondering</i>). I don't quite know.... I
<i>had</i> thought of this room, but&ndash;I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>crossing below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>to centre</i>). Ah! Yes!
Brighten the room up a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>walking up centre a little towards windows</i>). H'm, yes&mdash;&mdash;They are a bit faded.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>shaking out hers, and looking at them critically</i>). You
know, sometimes I think I love them, and sometimes I'm not quite sure.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Best way is to hang 'em up and see how you like 'em. Always
take 'em down again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, that's a good idea, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Best way.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes.... I think we might try that&ndash;(<i>looking round at settee
and carpets, etc</i>.)&ndash;the only thing is&ndash;(<i>She hesitates</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, the carpets and the chair-covers and the cushions and
things&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, what about 'em?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, if we had new curtains&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. You'd want a new carpet, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>doubtfully</i>). Well, <i>new chair-covers, anyhow.</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. H'm!... Well, why not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, but&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>with an awkward laugh</i>). We're not so hard up as all
that, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>quickly</i>). No, I don't suppose we are really&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. No, no, no, yes&ndash;I mean no.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>). I suppose it would mean that I should
have to go up to London to choose them. You know, that's rather a
nuisance.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>extremely casual and moving towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Oh, I don't
know. We might go up together one day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, of course if we <i>were</i> up&ndash;for anything else&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>moving away dubiously</i>). Yes, yes! That's what I meant.</p>

<p>(<i>There is another silence</i>. <span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>is wondering whether to
come to closer quarters with the great question</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, by the way, George&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>innocently</i>). I told Brian, and of course he'll tell
Dinah, that Mr. Pim had made a mistake about the name.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>astonished, moving towards</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Mistake about the
name?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes&ndash;I told Brian that the whole thing was a mistake, I thought
that was the simplest way.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Olivia&ndash;(<i>crossing below and to her</i> L.)&ndash;then you mean
that Brian and Dinah think that&ndash;that we have been married all the
time?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>coming closer to her</i>). Olivia, does that mean that you
are thinking of marrying me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. At your old registry office?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). Yes!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. To-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Do you want me to very much?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. My darling, you know I do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. We should have to keep it very quiet, George.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, of course&ndash;(<i>sitting to her</i> L.)&ndash;nobody need know.
We don't want anybody to know. And now that you've put Brian and Dinah
off the scent, by telling them that&ndash;(<i>he breaks off and says
admiringly</i>)&ndash;that was very clever of you, Olivia. I should never
have thought of that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>innocently</i>). George&ndash;you don't think it was
<i>wrong</i>, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>his verdict, taking her hands and patting them</i>). An
innocent deception... perfectly harmless.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes, dear, that was what I thought about&ndash;about&ndash;(<i>laughing
to herself</i>) what I was doing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Then you will come up to London to-morrow?</p>

<p>(<i>She nods</i>.)</p>

<p>And if we should see a carpet or anything else we want&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, George!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>beaming, rising and backing away to</i> L. <i>a little</i>).
And lunch at the Carlton, what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>nodding eagerly</i>). Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. And&ndash;and a bit of a honeymoon in Paris?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, what fun!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>hungrily</i>). Give me a kiss, old girl.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>lovingly</i>). George!</p>

<p>(<i>She holds up her cheek to him. He kisses it, and then suddenly
takes her in his arms</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Don't ever leave me, old girl.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>affectionately</i>). Don't ever send me away, old boy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>fervently</i>). I won't. (<i>Awkwardly</i>.) I&ndash;I don't
think I <i>should have</i> really, you know. I&ndash;I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>enters from up</i> L. <i>and crosses at back of writing-table
and round down</i> R. <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>follows her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>seeing the embrace, surprised</i>). Oo&ndash;I say!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>looks and feels rather a fool</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Hallo!</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>sits, resumes sewing</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>coming down centre and going below settee</i> L.,
<i>impetuously to him</i>). Give me one, too, George. Brian won't mind.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>formally, but enjoying it</i>). Do you mind, Mr. Strange?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>a little uncomfortable</i>). Oh, I say, sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. We'll risk it, Dinah. (<i>He kisses her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>triumphantly to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>and standing above</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>).
Did you notice that one? That wasn't just an ordinary affectionate
kiss. That was a special "bless you my children" one. (<i>To</i>
<span class="smallcaps">George</span>.) Wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. You do talk nonsense, darling.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>crossing quickly below and to</i> R. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). Well,
I'm so happy now that Pim has relented about your first husband&ndash;(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>catches</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia's</span> <i>eye and smiles; she smiles back; but
they are different smiles</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>the actor</i>). Yes, yes, stupid fellow, Pim, what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Yes. Absolute idiot, I think!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. And now that George has relented about&ndash;(<i>with a significant
look at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>)&ndash;<i>my</i> first husband&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Here, you get on much too quickly. (<i>Crossing below</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) So you want to marry my Dinah, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>with a smile</i>). Well, I do rather, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). Well, you'd better have a talk with me about
it&ndash;er&ndash;(<i>with a sly look at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>)&ndash;Brian.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>goes up and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>, <i>imitating his walk, accompanies
him</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Well, come along then. (<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>looks at his watch</i>.) I am
going up to town after tea, so we'd better&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>moving up to</i> R. <i>of</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>). I say, are you going to
London?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>with a sly look at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). Yes, a little business.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>cheekily</i>). Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Never you mind, young woman. (<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.) Come along,
we'll stroll down and look at the pigs.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Right-o!</p>

<p>(<i>They are going off to</i> L. <i>when</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>calls</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. George, don't go too far away; I may want you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. All right! I'll be out on the terrace. Give me a shout if you
want me.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">George</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>go off at windows up</i> L.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>follows up</i> R. <i>and watches them off</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>watching them off</i>). Brian and George always discuss me in
front of the pigs. So tactless of them. I say, are you going to London,
too, darling? (<i>Coming down to table</i> L.C.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. To-morrow&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Rising and shaking out curtains</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. What are you going to do in London?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Oh, shopping and&ndash;one or two little things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. With George?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Yes. (<i>Crossing up centre below</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>with
curtains</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>sits on table</i> L.C.). I say, wasn't it lovely about Pim?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Lovely?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Yes, he told me all about it. Making such a hash of things, I
mean.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>innocently</i>). Did he make a hash of things?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. Well, I mean keeping on coming like that. And if you look at it
all round&ndash;well, for all he had to say, he needn't have come at all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, I don't think I should put it quite like that, Dinah.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>referring to curtains</i>). I say, aren't they jolly?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I'm so glad everybody likes them. Tell George I'm ready, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. I say, is <i>he</i> going to put them up for you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. Well, I thought perhaps he could reach better.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. All right, I'll tell him. (<i>Crossing up</i> L. <i>on to
terrace and calling off</i>.) George! (<i>Returning to back</i> L.
<i>end of writing-table</i>.) Brian is just telling George about the
five shillings he has in the Post Office&ndash;(<i>crossing up</i> L. <i>on
to terrace again and calling off</i>.) George!!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>from off</i> L.). Coming!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>playfully coming down centre, imitating a fairy's
footsteps</i>). Slow music while the curtains go up. (<i>Sits at piano
and plays "As I passed by your Window.")</i></p>

<p>(<i><span class="smallcaps">George</span> enters from up</i> L., <i>followed by</i> <span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>). What is it, darling?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. I wish you'd help me to put up these curtains?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span>. Of course, dear. I'd better get the library steps. (<i>Crosses
to doors R. and exits</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> <i>goes quickly to <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> and gratefully kisses her hand, then
comes down to <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> and bows to her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Madam! I have the honour to inform you that hence-forward you
are at liberty to regard me as your affianced husband.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> (<i>rising quickly and advancing</i>). Darling!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span> (<i>waving her back</i>). No! No! Stay there! (<i>She retreats
and sits at piano</i>.) Go on playing.</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>goes on playing and he takes out a sketch-book, sits on
settee and sketches her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>. What is it?</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>comes down centre, watching them</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Brian</span>. Portrait of Lady Strange.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smallcaps">George</span> enters from doors</i> R. <i>with steps and crossing up R.
places them near</i> R. <i>window</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> (<i>she hands him the curtains and goes up L. of writing table
and round back, watching</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>). Are you ready, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>mounting the steps</i>). Yes, quite ready.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>. There! (<i>The curtains become entangled and he nearly
falls</i>.) Oh, take care, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">George</span> (<i>again mounting steps</i>). Oh, that's all right, dear.
They're a little long. (<i>The curtains become entangled round his
head</i>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pim</span> <i>enters mysteriously from up</i> L.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span> <i>is looking up at</i> <span class="smallcaps">George</span>.)</p>

<p>(<span class="smallcaps">Pim</span> <i>touches her on the shoulder and with a start she turns to
him</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>seeing him enter stops playing. <span class="smallcaps">Olivia</span>, unwilling to
attract</i> <span class="smallcaps">George's</span> <i>attention, signals to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> <i>to continue
playing, and, she does so</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pim</span>. Mrs. Marden! I <i>had</i> to come back&ndash;I've just remembered his
name was <i>Ernest</i> Polwittle&ndash;not <i>Henry</i>! (<i>Going off
up</i> L.) Not Henry!</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.
Oxford, MS 38655-4109

Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
method other than by check or money order.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
[Employee Identification Number] 64-622154.  Donations are
tax-deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund-raising
requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be
made and fund-raising will begin in the additional states.

We need your donations more than ever!

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,

     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
