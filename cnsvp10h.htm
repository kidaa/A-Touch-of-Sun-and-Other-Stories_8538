      It has been Good Housekeeping's privilege to build up, as a
      source for reader service, many departments that are unique
      and noteworthy in the extent to which they have gone in
      measuring consumer needs and consumer viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following pages are presented some observations made
      by one of these departments as the result of years of
      research and investigation in the field of household
      appliances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally speaking, most man-made devices are man-used. Here
      is an industry whose products are man-made, but woman-used.
      It is this fundamental condition that has placed the
      merchandising and selling problems of the industry absolutely
      in a class by themselves and has made them of peculiar
      importance and significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hoped that the material given herein may be of real
      service to those whose interest lies in knowing more about
      one of our most rapidly growing and least understood
      industries and also to those who would better understand the
      basic element in all manufacturing and selling.

    <h2>
      FOREWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The manufacture of home devices to be used by women in
      household work is of comparatively recent development, the
      growth of the industry has been so rapid that many
      manufacturers are still groping to establish standards that
      will meet the new and uncertain conditions under which their
      product must be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dealers in household equipment as well as manufacturers are
      still uncertain as to what constitutes the selling value of
      an article, because it has been impossible to predicate the
      conditions, the care and skill with which each device would
      be used after it was marketed. It is comparatively easy for
      designer and factory manager to guard against known
      conditions of use. The dishwashing machine for a hotel or
      restaurant service can be built to perform with satisfactory
      efficiency. Its operating purposes and costs are known, the
      skill of its operators is more or less established, and the
      materials can be so selected to result in a satisfactory life
      of the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a different story when the manufacturer's product is to
      be used in the typical American home. Household equipment of
      every type must be made so that it will prove adaptable to
      different service conditions, with regard to both homes and
      actual users. An even more important consideration is
      intermittent use that must be met successfully by all home
      devices. It is the unusual home in which washing is done more
      than once or twice a week. The balance of the time the
      machine must stand idle. And this is true of practically
      every other type of labor saving device. It represents the
      most difficult of conditions a factory product has to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dealing in the following pages with this most important
      subject it must be understood that Good Housekeeping
      Institute is offering valuable facts that have been
      established through fifteen years of experience in testing
      household equipment, and is further utilizing the viewpoint
      of thousands of consumers and dealers who have come for a
      conference with us either in person or by letter.

    </p>
    <h2>
      POINTS OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY MANUFACTURERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is not too much to say that in general the manufacturer
      wants to produce the article that the woman wants to buy. In
      many cases the reason he does not accomplish it is due to the
      fact that he does not divide his expenditures wisely. He
      neglects to pay the price for the highest grade skill in
      designing and he markets his product too quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of developing a specific design cannot be
      overestimated. No machine on the market, of any type, is one
      hundred per cent perfect and none on the market should,
      therefore, be taken as a standard to be met by the new
      manufacturer. It is a patchwork, only, that is obtained by
      one common method used to obtain a newly designed machine.
      Namely, the manufacturer purchases every type of machine,
      already marketed to perform a given work, and adapts one part
      from one machine, another part from a second machine and
      perhaps still another part from a third machine. Such a
      design must always be a compromise, and it is seldom possible
      to obtain the original working efficiency of the several
      parts in the new machine because of the necessary
      compromises.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second point that the manufacturer is apt to overlook is
      the importance of including the most minute of details in his
      general high standard of manufacture. For instance, he elects
      to use copper for a water container, but forgets to provide
      that every bolt and rivet and screw, no matter how small,
      shall be of a rust-resisting metal. The small part capable of
      rusting is as much an eyesore to the purchaser and in certain
      conditions can do as great damage as though the manufacturer
      had not spent the major sum to insure his rust-resisting
      container.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a third point: sometimes a manufacturer neglects to make
      certain of a perfection of detail in the factory that will
      produce one hundred per cent. of uniformity in his product.
      Thus vacuum cleaner manufacturers, merely by installing an
      equipment that would measure for them, under actual
      conditions of service, the correct air displacement of the
      particular machine tested, could eliminate any possibility of
      lack of uniformity in their product. Further, it would take
      no more time for the inspection than is at present accorded
      to the routine reading of current consumption. Yet up to this
      time we know of no vacuum cleaner factory that has installed
      this comparatively simple and inexpensive equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When attempting to market a product to women, factory faults
      are of far greater importance than when marketing a product
      for the use of men. The latter understand the difficulties of
      factory production and accept the occasional defective
      product as a routine. They expect it to be credited. They
      expect prompt correction on the part of the manufacturer or
      dealer, and, once adjusted, with them the matter usually
      ends. Not so with the average woman purchaser. First of all,
      and last of all, she remembers that something was the matter
      with the machine for which she paid her money. Oftentimes
      only the most drastic and unusual service on the part of the
      manufacturer will take away the sting that was left in her
      mind by the original transaction. In club, church, or in
      confidential chat at home, somewhere she leaves the
      impression that there is still something the matter or she
      would not have gotten a poor machine. The advertising value,
      therefore, of a uniformity of product cannot be
      overestimated. No amount of costly after-service will
      compensate for the lack of it.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;

      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>
      THE VALUE OF PROPER DEMONSTRATION BY THE DEALER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A manufacturer sometimes fails to satisfy the woman consumer
      because he is attempting to satisfy a dealer's demand for
      "flashy" rather than practical selling points and, therefore,
      loses sight of the value to him of a perfect functioning of
      his device. Exclusive points of design that can be used for a
      spectacular demonstration have been up to this time perhaps
      the strongest of selling aids; but manufacturers and dealers
      alike are beginning to realize that they have an element of
      danger. Thus, the confetti test for vacuum cleaners was an
      unfortunate misuse of the machine. It has never convinced the
      woman purchaser that it would accomplish the more trying task
      of removing "grimed-in" soil, even while it fascinated her as
      a spectator and even while she left as a purchaser. She
      doubted her own machine because of the unconvincing test.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a short time ago that in one of the trade papers
      dealing with household equipment there appeared an editorial
      endorsement, and an exceedingly strong one at that, of a
      certain dealer display which had attracted great crowds on
      both sidewalk and street before the dealer's window. The
      crowd had been drawn by the display of a number of different
      washing machines grouped around a central machine which was
      absorbing the "limelight." It had a swinging wringer and the
      wringer was revolving at so rapid a rate it became plain that
      any woman who stepped in the way of that particular type of
      wringer was doomed to a severe blow if not a fall. The idea
      of the dealer in using such a display was of the
      "stop-look-listen" variety, and he obtained all he could
      desire of this variety of interest. But he had not
      safeguarded the interest of <i>any</i> washing machine in his
      window. For women have a certain reluctance toward machinery
      in motion and he failed to reckon with them as the purchasers
      of his washing machines. Would she buy one in order to use
      the swinging wringer as an obvious menace to herself and to
      her household? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      In selecting an Iron, the woman looks for:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. A weight of household iron that is around six pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A general design that is easy to handle, of good balance
      and with comfortable large handle grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A thin sheet metal hood; weight in hood decreases ironing
      efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A correct relation between the weight of the storage heat
      mass above the heating element, and the weight of the sole
      plate beneath the heating element. Upon this relation depends
      good ironing results.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>If heating element should be inset in sole plate with
      one-fourth inch margin, a direct heat connection between the
      two masses of metal could be secured at a consequent
      reduction of heat loss.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Cord connections to slip in and out easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Switch in plug connection or on cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Plug connection so heat insulated as to prevent conduction
      of heat, and overheating of cord at connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly if there was a prospective woman purchaser in
      that group in front of the window she left to become one of
      the hundreds of women who still are asking themselves the
      question "is a washing machine safe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not difficult to see how quickly this particular kind
      of demonstration becomes a boomerang to the manufacturer. It
      is as true of every type of spectacular appeal. The time has
      surely come to discontinue all such practices and to sell
      appliances: because they will do the work more quickly, more
      easily, or more cheaply, because they are so built that they
      will prove durable, and therefore, a satisfactory investment;
      and finally, because they are the only logical solution of
      comfortable, well-ordered present day family life.
    </p>

      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>
      WHAT THE PURCHASER LOOKS FOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      It has been amply proved that women are not especially
      interested in fine points of design unless that interest is
      implanted by competitive statements of the salesmen. They are
      not especially interested in form or color or detail, but
      they are supremely interested in dealer assurance that the
      machine is solidly built; that it will accomplish the work;
      and that its purchase will save them money, time or labor,
      perhaps all three. Let the appliance itself impress them with
      the strength of the materials used, the cleanness of its
      design and the perfection of work performed, and the sale is
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>
      COST IS CONSIDERED
    </h2>
    <p>
      The question of cost considered only from the woman's
      standpoint of expenditure is more difficult to discuss. In
      the case of small equipment priced under or around five
      dollars it is easy to make large sales upon the time or
      labor-saving qualities the devices may have. But repeat sales
      are affected by the quality of construction and materials
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all higher priced equipment the question of strength and
      quality seems uppermost in her mind, but a difference in
      price between two makes or two models of same manufacture,
      often results in the sale of the higher priced, because she
      has enjoyed the opportunity of discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seems to be no question that the woman purchaser is
      willing to pay <i>any added sum required to make construction
      better or convenience greater</i>&#8212;always provided that
      the salesman convinces her she is obtaining the quality she
      is paying for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      In selecting a Vacuum Cleaner, the woman looks for:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. A design that will prove efficient at low upkeep cost over
      a period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If motor driven brush type [Footnote: Her selection may
      include either motor driven brush type or air type machine,
      since properly designed, either will care for all kinds of
      soil, including thread and lint.], there must be correct
      relation between air suction power and brush sweeping action.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. As light a construction as is consistent with quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. If air type, a narrow floor nozzle so designed as to clean
      by small amount of air at high velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. If air and brush (geared to wheels) type, a broader nozzle
      with inset brush is permissible provided care is exercised in
      design to prevent air leakage. This type cleans by a larger
      volume of air with correspondingly lower velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Durable construction, either aluminum or steel casings, an
      assembly that secures tight joints and seams that won't leak
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Easy operation&#8212;weight of appliance not so important
      if weight is easily handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Convenient switch; handle designed long enough for
      comfortable operation at woman's height.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Bag, double seamed; strong, tight connections; easily
      emptied; durable material, preferably of cotton flannel type.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Winding posts for cord to be strong and conveniently
      placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Convenience in connecting attachments.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Elimination of noise, in so far as this is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, then, of attempting merely to learn the dealer's
      demand for selling points, put part of your effort into
      learning the demands of the user of the machine. Consumer
      suggestion or demands are apt to come only after a period of
      use. Obvious ones are sometimes reported by the dealer, but
      very often they never come to the manufacturer through the
      reports of the trade in time to be of service. It took a
      period of years for the dealer to realize the importance of
      enclosed moving parts. It finally came to him through the
      reaction developed by women using the machines. In the same
      way the manufacture and marketing of both gas and electric
      ranges, which has been uniformly efficient, has overlooked
      one very important detail. The broiler grids are often so
      placed that the steak is an inch and a half away from the
      flame instead of one-half inch. With such a broiler, perfect
      broiling is impossible. Again a kitchen cabinet may be made
      of high grade materials but the hardware proves too light to
      stand the constant closing and opening. Such a kitchen
      cabinet is handicapped in any neighborhood because constant
      use makes the minor annoyance a cumulative one, which reacts
      directly upon the manufacturer's product.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vacuum cleaner that is easily sold on the dealer's floor
      because it looks big and imposing oftentimes discloses its
      poor efficiency only after from four to six months of use.
      This is due to the fact that from time immemorial women have
      ordained a period devoted to housecleaning twice a year. And
      it is at this crucial time that they discover if the routine
      care of rugs and carpets by their vacuum cleaner has
      accomplished a work satisfactory to them. This conclusion is
      well borne out by a conversation we had with a large dealer
      in vacuum cleaners from the west coast. He freely told us of
      handling two vacuum cleaners, one a comparatively inexpensive
      and absolutely inefficient machine (as we had proved by
      test), the other a more expensive and a thoroughly efficient
      machine. He claimed that the first proved only a feeder for
      the second, since when the woman, after a longer or shorter
      period of use, realized that the first machine would not do
      the work, she returned to buy the more expensive and better
      machine. And the average time was six months! Now this dealer
      could have selected a machine no higher in price than his
      less expensive model which would have done good work and
      thoroughly satisfied the user. We leave you to draw your own
      conclusions as to the fate of the manufacturer's product in
      the first place, and the dealer's selling methods in the
      second place.

      It is easy to sell a refrigerator that has a sightly
      appearance, that is equipped with a sanitary seamless lining
      and that is marked with a price that spells to the woman good
      workmanship. But it is only actual use in storing food that
      develops the fact that the insulation is of sufficient
      quantity and is assembled with high grade construction, or
      that cheap material and workmanship have been substituted.
      The service that can be obtained from the appliance after it
      is marketed is of the utmost importance for the manufacturer
      to learn. <i>It is peculiarly impossible to sell and "forget"
      any product sold to women.</i>

    <h2>
      THE WOMAN'S VIEWPOINT ON MATERIALS USED IN CONSTRUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly a phase of manufacturing that acutely interests
      the average manufacturer deals with the selection of the
      materials that are to be used in the construction of his
      product. Too often the person who selects these materials
      fails to take into account the fact that women are almost
      fanatically intolerant of two things, rust and discoloration.
      It may be but one bolt that can rust, but women under our
      observation have utterly condemned a washing machine for
      which they paid from $125 to $165 because of this one bolt
      alone. We have heard them further condemn a machine because
      of the difficulty of keeping it polished.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not purpose, we are convinced, but it must be
      carelessness on the part of that manufacturer who allows the
      use of a rusting screw here or a bolt there when the rest of
      the equipment is safeguarded against such conditions. In one
      specific instance a single part of a machine intended to be
      used in connection with water was made up of five different
      metals. Each one of these metals had its own different
      reaction towards hard water in the presence of soap. That
      this manufacturer had intended no slight toward his product
      was indicated by the fact that the largest section of this
      part was constructed of the most expensive material. He
      probably fully believed that he had made that particular part
      of rustproof material but it was the selection of defective
      small parts that offset any advantage due to his use of fine
      materials for the major part of the machine.
    </p>

      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>
      THE RELATION OF SECTIONAL SELLING TO MATERIALS USED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Because a great deal of household equipment that is of
      interest to women must be used as a water container, the
      effect of water of varying degrees of hardness upon the
      several metals is of interest. Most metals have some
      electrolytic action. There are throughout the country water
      supplies of every known degree of hardness. There are water
      supplies whose hardness can be corrected and there are
      supplies of the type known as "permanent" hardness. In actual
      practice the salts in these hard waters react with soap of
      any variety to form a sticky gray precipitate. This
      precipitate is increased in quantity in direct proportion to
      the activity of the metal. Therefore, the material selected
      for the tub and cylinder of a washing machine, for the
      container of the dishwashing machine, or for the tea kettle
      that demands constant contact with water should be given the
      careful attention that its importance demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      In selecting a Refrigerator, the woman looks for:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Seamless lining.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Compartment beneath ice high enough to hold quart milk
      bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Generous insulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. A selection of wood and treatment of it that will prevent
      warping.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Heavy hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Positive-closing, lever locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Plain unpanelled trim&#8212;high leg base.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Dull, rather than highly finished wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Easily accessible drain.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Adjustable shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      A universal metal that can withstand any and all attacks of
      these several waters is difficult if not impossible to
      locate. In our judgment there is no perfect metal. Copper
      comes the nearest to it and yet copper must be tinned, and
      there is some slight consumer reaction against its use, in
      large containers, because they claim copper must be scoured
      in order to be sightly. However, enamel paint on the outside
      of such a container, leaving only a fair sized name-plate to
      be burnished, would overcome this objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galvanized iron, zinc, nickel, all have a disadvantage of
      inducing electrolytic action (producing whitish precipitate)
      and that should be taken into account in your selection of
      metals. In sections save those in which waters are of the
      "permanent hard" variety, this disadvantage can be overcome
      by including directions that the machine should not be
      scoured. Flush with rinsing water only. With such care, the
      whitish deposit acts as a film over the metal, and, once the
      latter is completely covered, reduces the precipitation. But
      in the presence of extremely hard waters, the quantity is so
      great that the precipitate snows a tendency to deposit on the
      linen itself, instead of being thrown solely to the sides of
      tub, cylinder, or suction cup. Once this does get on the
      fabric, it has all the sticky characteristics of chewing gum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bronze or brass rather than steel or iron should be used for
      any bearings that come in contact with water. Only thus can
      you fully safeguard against rust.

    <h2>
      LITTLE THINGS THAT OFTEN PROVE GREAT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Safety demands that every equipment involving an electric
      motor be so fully insulated from the machine frame by
      water-proof fittings and insulated shaft couplings, etc.,
      that a maximum of safety can be assured. It is indeed
      remarkable that this is not more often cared for in the
      original design. In one short period, at least three machines
      were forced into the disapproval group in the Department of
      Household Engineering of Good Housekeeping Institute with
      such lack of insulation as one of the causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thus clear that consumer needs, in this great
      classification of merchandise (household appliances) as
      reflected by consumer attitude are often ill-defined and
      extremely difficult for the manufacturer to interpret.
      Therefore, as a recognition of this condition, the basic
      purpose running throughout all of the testing work at Good
      Housekeeping Institute is to test every device so as to
      duplicate the conditions under which the device will be used
      by the ultimate consumer, be she intelligent or
      unintelligent. It has furthermore been the Institute's
      special province to express to each manufacturer the trend of
      consumer demand as seen, not only through the Institute's use
      of appliances, but through the thousands of consumers who
      report their experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an interesting and surprising fact that mechanical
      tests develop data which often interpret the results obtained
      under practical usage of the equipment, and the results
      obtained under the practical usage quite as often define the
      value of the mechanical data. Any effort a manufacturer may
      make to develop these two angles of testing will more than
      offset any money cost that may be added to the factory
      overhead. Complete testing of this character will also save
      ultimate consumer reactions against the completed
      manufactured product. It is not enough, as so many
      manufacturers have done, to place the appliance in a variety
      of homes and take the consequent "say-so." It must be
      remembered that it is only possible to compare an appliance
      when you have something to compare it with, and that
      something must be an appliance designed to do similar work.
      How many instances are there where manufacturers allow their
      products to go out without comparative information of this
      kind, just because such information is so extremely difficult
      to get?
    </p>
    <p>
      To all interested in or concerned with this great industry,
      there is one thing to be remembered above all
      else&#8212;study and test not only the mechanical
      construction and perfection of your product but know from
      every conceivable angle what the user or consumer is going to
      demand of it. If this be done, and done thoroughly, and
      exhaustively, you will build the appliance of the best
      materials obtainable, because it must wear well; of the most
      efficient design, because it must operate smoothly; and you
      cannot fail to so build it that it will do its work
      completely and well because you will have the measure of
      these values within the experience of your own investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of this care in manufacture will promptly be
      reflected when marketing your product in at least three
      ways,&#8212;first, increase of sales and repeat sales;
      second, a lowered overhead cost for servicing, repairing, and
      replacing defective machines, and third, a fairer and lower
      price to the consumer because it is based on the cost of her
      machine only since she is not burdened with a share of her
      neighbor's repairs in your "overhead."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is perhaps no household device operated by electricity
      that is more complicated in its oiling system than the
      old-fashioned sewing machine and yet the manufacturer managed
      to train the housewife to ninety per cent. efficiency in
      caring for the machine. Therefore, well defined and specified
      places for oiling should be provided for, and decalcomaniac
      or otherwise permanent directions placed on all enclosed
      gearings, in order that the user may continually have before
      her the correct places marked for oiling. It is not enough to
      supply a circular of directions: she loses it promptly as has
      been proved over and over again. All important service
      directions must be permanent.

    </p>
    <h2>
      SOME NEEDS OF THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is largely because there has not been a consumer demand
      that was well defined that we find few equipments designed
      with attention to the proper working heights. Moreover, we
      are convinced that it is a decidedly difficult question to
      settle. However, it is possible to group most exertions that
      women must practice into two classes: those that involve
      upper arm muscles, as work at a sink, range, washtub, or
      washing machine, etc., and secondly, exertions that involve
      the muscles of the forearm, as the mixing, stirring, and
      beating involved in cookery processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first case any variations in a woman's height makes
      comparatively little difference. A range of heights from five
      feet to six feet would be served equally well by a similar
      height of equipment. This makes it possible to lay down the
      rule that sinks should be designed and plumbers should
      provide for piping them at a height of thirty-five inches
      from the bottom of the sink to the floor. Ranges should be
      thirty-four inches in height to the working top, and both
      washing machines and tubs should be thirty-eight inches to
      their rims. This enables all work to be done with straight
      unstrained back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the forearm muscle is involved, however, it becomes a
      far more delicate question. The distance between work-table
      top and elbow must be the control on designing. For that
      reason it is not possible to establish a constant and ideal
      height for kitchen cabinets and working table surfaces,
      although in general most of these have been from one to two
      inches too low. "Adjustable in height" seems to be the only
      answer to this phase of the problem. Some one, sometime, will
      undoubtedly design a well made table (we have already seen
      one of poor construction) that will have strong, as well as
      adjustable leg support. Some one, sometime, will build a good
      refrigerator (as we have seen a poor one) constructed with
      the sanitary, high leg-base of the present day office desk.
      It will obviate stooping and it will enable one to get the
      refrigerator pan without groping provided there can be no
      drain. It will further allow for a refrigerator pan large
      enough to prevent the common accident of overflowing. Again,
      sometime, we believe the manufacturer of kitchen cabinets
      will see a picture of kitchens built with four, straight,
      clean walls and completely equipped with the pantry on one
      wall, consisting of kitchen cabinet and side units for
      storage cabinets, each one of these side cabinets to be only
      fourteen inches deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time will come&#8212;it is almost here&#8212;when the
      demand from women for the high sink we have already indicated
      is going to be strong enough so that the Plumber's standards
      for cutting pipe will be changed to meet her demand. It is
      difficult to realize, but it is nevertheless true, that every
      woman who wishes a properly placed sink in her kitchen or
      pantry has to overcome the inertia of the plumber not only
      because of his conservative unwillingness to do this unusual
      task, but because he is put to the extra expense and trouble
      of getting "specials" in pipe length, due to the fact that
      the plumbing trade, as yet, has not recognized an at least
      partially developed consumer demand.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
