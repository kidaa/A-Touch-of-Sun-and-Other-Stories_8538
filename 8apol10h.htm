<h1>Chapter I.</h1>

<p>Mrs. Sam Wyndham was generally at home after five
o&rsquo;clock. The established custom whereby the
ladies who live in Beacon Street all receive their
friends on Monday afternoon did not seem to her satisfactory.
She was willing to conform to the practice, but she
reserved the right of seeing people on other days
as well.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sam Wyndham was never very popular. That is to
say, she was not one of those women who are seemingly
never spoken ill of, and are invited as a matter of
course, or rather as an element of success, to every
dinner, musical party, and dance in the season.</p>

<p>Women did not all regard her with envy, all young
men did not think she was capital fun, nor did all
old men come and confide to her the weaknesses of
their approaching second childhood. She was not invariably
quoted as the standard authority on dress, classical
music, and Boston literature, and it was not an unpardonable
heresy to say that some other women might be, had
been, or could be, more amusing in ordinary conversation.
Nevertheless, Mrs. Sam Wyndham held a position in Boston
which Boston acknowledged, and which Boston insisted
that foreigners such as New Yorkers, Philadelphians
and the like, should acknowledge also in that spirit
of reverence which is justly due to a descent on both
sides from several signers of the Declaration of Independence,
and to the wife of one of the ruling financial spirits
of the aristocratic part of Boston business.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Mrs. Wyndham was about forty
years of age, as all her friends of course knew; for
it is as easy for a Bostonian to conceal a question
of age as for a crowned head. In a place where one
half of society calls the other half cousin, and went
to school with it, every one knows and accurately
remembers just how old everybody else is. But Mrs.
Wyndham might have passed for younger than she was
among the world at large, for she was fresh to look
at, and of good figure and complexion. Her black hair
showed no signs of turning gray, and her dark eyes
were bright and penetrating still. There were lines
in her face, those microscopic lines that come so
abundantly to American women in middle age, speaking
of a certain restless nervousness that belongs to them
especially; but on the whole Mrs. Sam Wyndham was fair
to see, having a dignity of carriage and a grace of
ease about her that at once gave the impression of
a woman thoroughly equal to the part she had to play
in the world, and not by any means incapable of enjoying
it.</p>

<p>For the rest, Mrs. Sam led a life very much like the
lives of many rich Americans. She went abroad frequently,
wandered about the continent with her husband, went
to Egypt and Algiers, stayed in England, where she
had a good many friends, avoided her countrymen and
countrywomen when away from home, and did her duty
in the social state to which she was called in Boston.</p>

<p>She read the books of the period, and generally pronounced
them ridiculous; she believed in her husband&rsquo;s
politics, and aristocratically approved the way in
which he abstained from putting theory into practice,
from voting, and in a general way from dirtying his
fingers with anything so corrupt as government, or
so despicable as elections; she understood Boston
business to some extent, and called it finance, but
she despised the New York Stock Market and denounced
its doings as gambling. She made fine distinctions,
but she was a woman of sense, and was generally more
likely to be right than wrong when she had a definite
opinion, or expressed a definite dislike. Her religious
views were simple and unobtrusive, and never changed.</p>

<p>Her custom of being at home after five o&rsquo;clock
was perhaps the only deviation she allowed herself
from the established manners of her native city, and
since two or three other ladies had followed her example,
it had come to be regarded as a perfectly harmless
idiosyncrasy for which she could not properly be blamed.
The people who came to see her were chiefly men, except,
of course, on the inevitable Monday.</p>

<p>A day or two before Christmas, then, Mrs. Sam Wyndham
was at home in the afternoon. The snow lay thick and
hard outside, and the sleigh bells tinkled unceasingly
as the sleighs slipped by the window, gleaming and
glittering in the deep red glow of the sunset. The
track was well beaten for miles away, down Beacon
Street and across the Milldam to the country, and
the pavements were strewn with ashes to give a foothold
for pedestrians.</p>

<p>For the frost was sharp and lasting. But within, Mrs.
Wyndham sat by the fire with a small table before
her, and one companion by her side, for whom she was
pouring tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about your summer, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo;
said she, teasing the flame of the spirit-lamp into
better shape with a small silver instrument.</p>

<p>Mr. Pocock Vancouver leaned back in his corner of
the sofa and looked at the fire, then at the window,
and finally at his hostess, before he answered. He
was a pale man and slight of figure, with dark eyes,
and his carefully brushed hair, turning gray at the
temples and over his forehead, threw his delicate,
intelligent face into relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not done much,&rdquo; he answered, rather
absently, as though trying to find something interesting
in his reminiscences; and he watched Mrs. Wyndham
as she filled a cup. He was not the least anxious to
talk, it seemed, and he had an air of being thoroughly
at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were in England most of the time, were
you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;I believe I was. Oh, by the bye, I met
Harrington in Paris; I thought he meant to stay at
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He often goes abroad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham
indifferently. &ldquo;One lump of sugar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two, if you please&ndash;no cream&ndash;thanks. Does
he go to Paris to convert the French, or to glean
materials for converting other people?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Vancouver languidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I cannot tell you,&rdquo; answered
the lady, still indifferently. &ldquo;What do you
go to Paris for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Principally to renew my acquaintance with civilized
institutions and humanizing influences. What does
anybody go abroad for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always talk like that when you come home,
Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham. &ldquo;But
nevertheless you come back and seem to find Boston
bearable. It is not such a bad place after all, is
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it were not for half a dozen people here,
I would never come back at all,&rdquo; said Mr. Vancouver.
&ldquo;But then, I am not originally one of you, and
I suppose that makes a difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray, who are the half dozen people who
procure us the honor of your presence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are one of them, Mrs. Wyndham,&rdquo; he
answered, looking at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged,&rdquo; she replied, demurely.
&ldquo;Any one else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;John Harrington,&rdquo; said Vancouver
with a little laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham, innocently;
&ldquo;I did not know you were such good friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Vancouver sipped his tea in silence for a moment
and stared at the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a great respect for Harrington,&rdquo;
he said at last. &ldquo;He interests me very much,
and I like to meet him.&rdquo; He spoke seriously,
as though thoroughly in earnest. The faintest look
of amusement came to Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s face for
a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Mr.
Harrington is a very good friend of mine. Do you mind
lighting those candles? The days are dreadfully short.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pocock Vancouver rose with alacrity and performed
the service required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham, watching
him, &ldquo;I have a surprise for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, an immense surprise. Do you remember Sybil
Brandon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charlie Brandon&rsquo;s daughter? Very well&ndash;saw
her at Newport some time ago. Lily-white style&ndash;all
eyes and hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to remember her. You used to rave
about her, and you nearly ruined yourself in roses.
You will have another chance; she is going to spend
the winter with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Vancouver,
in some surprise, as he again sat down upon the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; you know she is all alone in the world
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Is her mother dead too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She died last spring, in Paris. I thought you
knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Vancouver, thoughtfully. &ldquo;How
awfully sad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor girl,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham; &ldquo;I
thought it would do her good to be among live people,
even if she does not go out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is she coming?&rdquo; There was a show
of interest about the question. &ldquo;She is here
now,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Vancouver. &ldquo;May
I have another cup?&rdquo; His hostess began the usual
series of operations necessary to produce a second
cup of tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wyndham,&rdquo; began Vancouver again
after a pause, &ldquo;I have an idea&ndash;do not laugh,
it is a very good one, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not laughing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not marry Sibyl Brandon to John Harrington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham stared for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How perfectly ridiculous!&rdquo; she cried
at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would starve, to begin with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I am sure Mr. Harrington never had more
than five thousand a year in his life. You could not
marry on that, you know&ndash;possibly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but Miss Brandon is very well off&ndash;rich,
in fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought she had nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have thirty or forty thousand a year
from her mother, at the least. You know Charlie never
did anything in his life; he lived on his wife&rsquo;s
money, and Miss Brandon must have it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham did not appear surprised at the information;
she hardly seemed to think it of any importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew she had something,&rdquo; she repeated;
&ldquo;but I am glad if you are right. But that does
not make it any more feasible to marry her to Mr.
Harrington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that starvation was your objection,&rdquo;
said Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; not that only. Besides, he would not
marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would be very foolish not to, if he had
the chance,&rdquo; remarked Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he might not even have the chance&ndash;perhaps
she would not marry him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Besides, I do not think John
Harrington ought to marry yet; he has other things
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Vancouver seemed about to say something in answer,
but he checked himself; possibly he did not speak
because he saw some one enter the room at that moment,
and was willing to leave the discussion of John Harrington
to a future time.</p>

<p>In fact, the person who entered the room should have
been the very last to hear the conversation that was
taking place, for it was Miss Brandon herself, though
Mr. Vancouver had not recognized her at once.</p>

<p>There were greetings and hand-shakings, and then Miss
Brandon sat down by the fire and spread out her hands
as though to warm them. She looked white and cold.</p>

<p>There are women in the world, both young and old,
who seem to move among us like visions from another
world, a world that is purer and fairer, and more
heavenly than this one in which the rest of us move.
It is hard to say what such women have that marks
them so distinctly; sometimes it is beauty, sometimes
only a manner, often it is both. It is very certain
that we know and feel their influence, and that many
men fear it as something strange and contrary to the
common order of things, a living reproach and protest
against all that is base and earthly and badly human.</p>

<p>Most people would have said first of Sybil Brandon
that she was cold, and many would have added that
she was beautiful. Ill-natured people sometimes said
she was deathly. No one ever said she was pretty. Vancouver&rsquo;s
description&ndash;lily-white, all eyes and hair&ndash;certainly
struck the principal facts of her appearance, for
her skin was whiter than is commonly natural, her
eyes were very deep and large and blue, and her soft
brown hair seemed to be almost a burden to her from
its great quantity. She was dressed entirely in black,
and being rather tall and very slight of figure, the
dress somewhat exaggerated the ethereal look that was
natural to her. She seemed cold, and spread out her
delicate hands to the bright flame of the blazing
wood-fire. Mrs. Wyndham and Pocock Vancouver looked
at her in silence for a moment. Then Mrs. Wyndham
rose with a cup of tea in her hand, and crossed to
the other side of the fireplace where Sybil was sitting
and offered it to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Sybil, you are so cold. Drink some tea.&rdquo;
The elder woman sat down by the young girl, and lightly
kissed her cheek. &ldquo;You must not be sad, darling,&rdquo;
she whispered sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sad at all, really,&rdquo; answered
Miss Brandon aloud, quite naturally, but pressing
Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s hand a little, as though in acknowledgment
of her sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one can be sad in Boston,&rdquo; said Vancouver,
putting in a word. &ldquo;Our city is altogether too
wildly gay.&rdquo; He laughed a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not make fun of us to visitors, Mr.
Vancouver,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Wyndham, still holding
Sybil&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s ruling passion,
though he never acknowledges it,&rdquo; said Miss
Brandon, calmly. &ldquo;I remember it of old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am flattered at being remembered,&rdquo;
said Mr. Vancouver, whose delicate features betrayed
neither pleasure nor interest, however. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;I am not particularly flattered
at being called a scoffer at my own people&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not say that,&rdquo; interrupted Miss
Brandon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you said my ruling passion was making
fun of Boston to visitors; at least, you and Mrs.
Wyndham said it between you. I really never do that,
unless I give the other side of the question as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What other side?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Sam, who
wanted to make conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boston,&rdquo; said Vancouver with some solemnity.
&ldquo;It is not more often ridiculous than other
great institutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You simply take one&rsquo;s breath away, Mr.
Vancouver,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham, with a good deal
of emphasis. &ldquo;The idea of calling Boston &rsquo;an
institution!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly. The United States are only
an institution after all. You could not soberly call
us a nation. Even you could not reasonably be moved
to fine patriotic phrases about your native country,
if your ancestors had signed twenty Declarations of
Independence. We live in a great institution, and
we have every right to flatter ourselves on the success
of its management; but in the long run this thing will
not do for a nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Brandon looked at Vancouver with a sort of calm
incredulity. Mrs. Wyndham always quarreled with him
on points like the one now raised, and accordingly
took up the cudgels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see how you can congratulate yourself
on the management of your institution, as you call
it, when you know very well you would rather die than
have anything to do with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true. But then, you always say that gentlemen
should not touch anything so dirty as politics, Mrs.
Wyndham,&rdquo; retorted Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that just shows that it is not an institution
at all, and that you are quite wrong, and that we
are a great nation supported and carried on by real
patriotism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Irish and German votes,&rdquo; added
Vancouver, with that scorn which only the true son
of freedom can exhibit in speaking of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Irish vote! That is always the last
word in the argument,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see exactly what the Irish have to
do with it,&rdquo; remarked Miss Brandon, innocently.
She did not understand politics.</p>

<p>Vancouver glanced at the clock and took his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very simple,&rdquo; he said, rising to
go. &ldquo;It is the bull in the china shop&ndash;the Irish
bull amongst the American china&ndash;dangerous, you know.
Good evening, Mrs. Wyndham; good evening, Miss Brandon.&rdquo;
And he took his leave. Miss Brandon watched his slim
figure disappear through the heavy curtains of the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not changed much since I knew him,&rdquo;
she said, turning again to the fire. &ldquo;I used
to think he was clever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you changed your mind?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Wyndham, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite, but I begin to doubt. He has very
good manners, and looks altogether like a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mrs. &ldquo;Wyndham.&rdquo;
His mother was a Shaw, although his father came from
South Carolina. But he is really very bright; Sam always
says he is one of the ablest men in Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; inquired Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is a lawyer, don&rsquo;t you know?&ndash;great
railroad man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Brandon, and relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham rose and stood before the fire, and pushed
a log back with her small foot. Miss Brandon watched
her, half wondering whether the flames would not catch
her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been to see that Miss Thorn,&rdquo;
said Sybil presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sam, with sudden
interest, &ldquo;tell me all about her this minute,
dear. Is not she the most extraordinary creature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather like her,&rdquo; answered Miss Brandon.
&ldquo;She is very pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What style? Dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; not exactly. Brown hair, and lots of eyebrows.
She is a little thing, but very much alive, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awfully English, of course,&rdquo; suggested
Mrs. Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;yes, I suppose so. She is wild about
horses, and says she shoots. But I like her&ndash;I am
sure I shall like her very much. She does not seem
very pleased with her aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wonder,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sam. &ldquo;Poor
little thing&ndash;she has nobody else belonging to her,
has she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Sybil, with a little
tremor in her voice; &ldquo;she has a mother in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see her ever so much,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Sam. &ldquo;Bring her to luncheon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see her to-night, I think; she said
she was going to that party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to leave you alone,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wyndham. &ldquo;I really think I had better not go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Wyndham,&rdquo; said Sybil, rising,
and laying her hands on her hostess&rsquo;s shoulders,
half affectionately, half in protest, &ldquo;this idea
must be stopped from the first, and I mean to stop
it. You are not to give up any party, or any society,
or anything at all for me. If you do I will go away
again. Promise me, will you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, dear. But you know you are the dearest
girl in the world.&rdquo; And so they kissed, and
agreed that Mrs. Wyndham should go out, and that Sybil
should stay at home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham was really a very kind-hearted woman
and a loving friend. That might be the reason why
she was never popular. Popularity is a curious combination
of friendliness and indifference, but very popular
people rarely have devoted friends, and still more
rarely suffer great passions. Everybody&rsquo;s friend
is far too apt to be nobody&rsquo;s, for it is impossible
to rely on the support of a person whose devotion is
liable to be called upon a hundred times a day, from
a hundred different quarters. The friendships that
mean anything mean sacrifice for friendship&rsquo;s
sake; and a man or a woman really ready to make sacrifices
for a considerable number of people is likely to be
asked to do it very often, and to be soon spent in
the effort to be true to every one.</p>

<p>But popularity makes no great demands. The popular
man is known to be so busy in being popular that his
offenses of omission are readily pardoned. His engagements
are legion, his obligations are innumerable, and far
more than he can fulfill. But, meet him when you will,
his smile is as bright, his greeting as cordial, and
his sayings as universally good-natured and satisfactory
as ever. He has acquired the habit of pleasing, and
it is almost impossible for him to displease. He enjoys
it all, is agreeable to every one, and is never expected
to catch cold in attending a friend&rsquo;s funeral,
or otherwise to sacrifice his comfort, because he is
quite certain to have important engagements elsewhere,
in which the world always believes. There is probably
no individual more absolutely free and  untrammeled
than the thoroughly popular man.</p>

<h1>Chapter II.</h1>

<p>Fate, the artist, mixes her own colors. She grinds
them with a pestle in the fashion of the old masters,
and out of the most strange pigments she produces
often only soft neutral tints for background and shadow,
kneading a vast deal of bright colors away among the
grays and browns; but now and then she takes a palette
loaded with strong paint, and a great brush, and splashes
a startling full length portrait upon the canvas, without
much regard for drawing or general composition, but
with very startling effect. To paint well needs life-long
study; to paint so as merely to attract attention
needs courage and a heart hardened against artistic
sensitiveness.</p>

<p>John Harrington was a high light against the mezzotint
of his surroundings. He was a constant source of interest,
and not infrequently of terror, to the good town of
Boston. True, he was a Bostonian himself, a chip of
the old block, whose progenitors had lived in Salem,
and whose very name breathed Pilgrim memories. He
even had a teapot that had come over in the Mayflower.
This was greatly venerated, and whenever John Harrington
said anything more than usually modern, his friends
brandished the teapot, morally speaking, in his defense,
and put it in the clouds as a kind of rainbow&ndash;a promise
that Puritan blood could not go wrong. Nevertheless,
John Harrington continued to startle his fellow-townsmen
by his writings and sayings, so that many of the grave
sort shook their heads and swore that he sympathized
with the Irish and believed in Chinese labor.</p>

<p>As a matter-of-fact, he did not mince matters. Endowed
with unbounded courage and an extraordinary command
of language, when he got upon his feet he spoke his
mind in a way that was good to hear. Moreover, he had
the strong oratorical temperament that forces attention
and commands men in a body. He said that things were
wrong and should be put right; and when he had said
so for half an hour to a couple of thousand people,
most of them were ready to follow him out of the hall
and go and put things right on the spot, with their
own hands. As yet the opportunity had not offered
for proceeding in so simple a manner, but the aforesaid
Bostonians of the graver sort said that John Harrington
would some day be seen heading a desperate mob of
socialists in an assault upon the State House. What
he had to do with socialism, or to what end he should
thus fiercely invade the headquarters of all earthly
respectability, was not exactly apparent, but the
picture thus evoked in the minds of the solemn burghers
satisfactorily defined for them the personality of
the man, and they said it and said it again.</p>

<p>It was somewhat remarkable that he had never been
called clever. At first he was regarded as a fool
by most of his own class, though he always had friends
who believed in him. By and by, as it came to be seen
that he had a purpose and would be listened to while
he stated it, Boston said there was something in him;
but he was never said to be clever or &ldquo;bright&rdquo;&ndash;he
was John Harrington, neither more nor less. He was
never even called &ldquo;Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a friend of Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s; her keen
instincts had long ago recognized the true metal in
the man, and of all who came and went in her house
there was none more welcome than he. Sam Wyndham utterly
disagreed with him in politics, but always defended
him in private, saying that he would &ldquo;calm down
a lot when he got older,&rdquo; and that meanwhile
he was &ldquo;a very good fellow if you did not stir
him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was therefore very intimate at the Sam Wyndham
establishment; in fact, at the very hour when Pocock
Vancouver was drinking Mrs. Sam&rsquo;s tea, John
had intended to be enjoying the same privilege. Unfortunately
for his intention he was caught elsewhere and could
not get away. He was drinking tea, it is true, but
the position in which he found himself was not entirely
to his taste.</p>

<p>Old Miss Schenectady, whose niece, Miss Josephine
Thorn, had lately come over from England to pass the
winter, had asked John Harrington to call that afternoon.
The old lady believed in John on account of the Mayflower
teapot, and consequently thought him a desirable acquaintance
for her niece. Accordingly, John went to the house,
and met Miss Sybil Brandon just as she was leaving
it; which he regretted, suspecting that her society
would have been more interesting than that of Miss
Thorn. As it turned out, he was right, for his first
impression of the young English girl was not altogether
agreeable; and he found himself obliged to stay and
talk to her until an ancient lady, who had come to
gossip with Miss Schenectady, and was fully carrying
out her intentions, should go away and  make it possible
for him to take his leave without absolutely abandoning
Miss Thorn in the corner of the room she had selected
for the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that, of course, you know,&rdquo; said
Miss Thorn, in answer to some remark of John&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;but what sort of things do you really care for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People,&rdquo; answered John without hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; returned his companion, &ldquo;everybody
likes people. It is not very original. One could not
live without lots of society, could one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends on the meaning of society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not in the least learned about meanings,&rdquo;
answered Miss Thorn. &ldquo;I mean what one means
by society, you know. Heaps of men and women, and
tea-parties, and staying in the country, and that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a sketch indeed,&rdquo; said John,
laughing. &ldquo;But then it is rather different here.
We do not relapse into the country as you do in England,
and then come back to town like lions refreshed with
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because once in society here one is always
in it. At least, most people are. As soon as heat
begins Boston goes to New York; and by-and-by New
York goes to Saratoga, and takes Boston with it; and
then all three go to Newport, and the thing begins
again, until there is a general rush to Lenox, to
see the glories of the autumn; and by the time the
glories are getting a little thin it is time to be
in Beacon Street again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when do people shoot and ride?&ndash;do they
ever hunt?&rdquo; asked Miss Thorn, opening her wide
brown eyes in some astonishment at John Harrington&rsquo;s
description of society life in America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, they hunt at Newport with a drag and
a bagged fox. They do it in July and August, when
it is as hot as it can be, and the farmers turn out
with pitchforks and stones to warn them off the growing
crops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Josephine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is absurd, of course,&rdquo; said Harrington,
&ldquo;and cruel. But I must say they ride as though
there were no hereafter, and it is a stiff country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must, I should think; no one who believed
in a hereafter would hunt in summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wager that if you go to Newport this
summer you will hunt, just like everybody else,&rdquo;
said John boldly.</p>

<p>Josephine Thorn knew in her heart that it was true,
but she did not like the tone in which John said it.
There was an air of certainty about his way of talking
that roused her opposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would do nothing so foolish,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;You do not know me. And do you mean to
tell me that you like these people who rush madly about
the country and hunt in summer, and those sort of
things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;not always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said you liked people. How awfully
inconsistent you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I think not. I meant that I liked
people and having to do with them&ndash;with men and women&ndash;better
than I like things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are &rsquo;things&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired
Josephine, sarcastically. &ldquo;You are not very
clear in your way of expressing yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be as clear as you please,&rdquo; answered
John, looking across the room at Miss Schenectady
and her ancient friend, and devoutly wishing he could
get away. &ldquo;I mean by &lsquo;things&rsquo; the
study of the inanimate part of creation, of such sciences
as are not directly connected with man&rsquo;s thoughts
and actions, and such pursuits as hunting, shooting,
and sporting of all kinds, which lead only to the
amusement of the individual. I mean also the production
of literature for literature&rsquo;s sake, and of works
of art for the mere sake of themselves. When I say
I like &lsquo;people,&rsquo; I mean men and women,
their opinions and their relations to each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would get very tired of
them,&rdquo; said Miss Thorn scornfully. &ldquo;They
are all dreadfully alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She never forgot the look Harrington turned upon her
as he answered. His  calm, deep-set gray eyes gazed
steadily at her, and his square features assumed an
air of gravity that almost startled her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am never tired of men and women,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Has it ever struck you, Miss Thorn, that
the study of men and women means the study of government,
and that a knowledge of men and women may give the
power to influence the destiny of mankind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it like that,&rdquo; said
Josephine, very quietly. She was surprised at his
manner, and she suddenly felt that he was no ordinary
man.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, her aunt had informed her that
John Harrington was coming that afternoon, and had
told her he was an exceedingly able man, a statement
which at once roused Josephine&rsquo;s opposition to
its fiercest pitch. She thoroughly hated to be warned
about people, to be primed as it were with a dose
of their superiority beforehand. It always prepared
her to dislike the admirable individual when he appeared.
It seemed as though it were taken for granted that
she herself had not enough intelligence to discover
wit in others, and needed to be told of it with great
circumstance in order to be upon her good behavior.
Consequently Josephine began by disliking John. She
thought he was a Philistine; his hair was too straight,
and besides, it was red; he shaved all his face, whereas
the men she liked always had beards; she liked men
with black eyes, or blue&ndash; John&rsquo;s were gray
and hard; he spoke quietly, without expression, and
she liked men who were enthusiastic. After all, too,
the things he said were not very clever; anybody could
have said them.</p>

<p>She meant to show her Boston aunt that she had no
intention of accepting Boston genius on faith. It
was not her way; she liked to find out for herself
whether people were able or not, without being told,
and if she ascertained that John Harrington enjoyed
a fictitious reputation for genius it would amuse
her to destroy it&ndash;or at all events to write a long
letter home to a friend, expressing her supreme opinion
on that and other matters.</p>

<p>John, on his part, did not very much care what impression
he produced. He never did on such occasions, and just
now he was rendered doubly indifferent by the fact
that he was wishing himself somewhere else. True,
there was a certain novelty in being asked point-blank
questions about his tastes. Boston people knew what
he liked, and generally only asked him about what
he did. Perhaps, if he had met Josephine by daylight,
instead of in the dim shadows of Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s
front drawing-room, he might have been struck by her
appearance and interested by her manner. As it was,
he was merely endeavoring to get through his visit
with a proper amount of civility, in the hope that
he might get away in time to see Mrs. Sam Wyndham
before dinner.</p>

<p>Josephine thought John dull, probably well informed,
and utterly without interest in anything. She felt
inclined to do something desperate&ndash;to throw the cushions
at him, to do anything, in short, to rouse him from
his calmness. Then he made that remark about government,
and his voice deepened, and his gray eyes shone, and
she was aware that he had a great and absorbing interest
in life, and that he could be roused in one direction
at least. To do her justice, she had quick perceptions,
and the impression on her mind was instantaneous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it like that,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo; she added in a moment,
&ldquo;I should not have thought you took much interest
in anything at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John laughed. He was amused at the idea that he, who
knew himself to be one of the most enthusiastic of
mortals, should be thought indifferent; and he was
amused at the outspoken frankness of the girl&rsquo;s
remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that is just like me,&rdquo; continued
Miss Thorn quickly. &ldquo;I always say what I think,
you know. I cannot help it a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity all the world is not like you!&rdquo;
said John. &ldquo;It would save a great deal of trouble,
I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The frump is going at last,&rdquo; said Josephine,
in an undertone, as the ancient friend rose and showed
signs of taking leave of Miss Schenectady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is certainly no mistake about the frankness
of that speech,&rdquo; said John, rising to his feet
and laughing again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no mistaking its truth,&rdquo; answered
Josephine. &ldquo;She is the real thing&ndash;the real
old-fashioned frump&ndash;we have lots of them at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remind me of Heine,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;He
said he called a spade a spade, and Herr Schmidt an
ass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Thorn laughed. &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;that is the knowledge of men which you say
leads to power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose also, and there was a little stir as the
old lady departed. Josephine watched John as he bowed
and opened the door of the room to let the visitor
out. She wondered vaguely whether she would like him,
whether he might not really be a remarkable man&ndash;a
fact she doubted in proportion as her aunt assured
her of its truth; she liked his looks and tried to
determine whether he was handsome or not, and she watched
closely for any awkwardness or shyness of manner,
that being the fault in a man which she never pardoned.</p>

<p>He was very different from the men she had generally
known, and most completely different from those she
had known as her admirers. In fact she had never admired
her admirers at all,&ndash;except dear Ronald, of course.
They competed with her on her own ground, and she knew
well enough she was more than a match for any of them.
Ronald was different; she had known him all her life.
But all those other men! They could ride&ndash;but she rode
as well, or better. They could shoot, but so could
she, and allowing for the disadvantages of a woman
in field sports, she was as good a shot as they. She
knew she could do anything they could do, and understood
most things they understood. All in all, she did not
care for the average young Englishman. He was great
fun in his own way, but there were probably more interesting
things in the world than pheasants and fences. Politics
would be interesting, she thought; she had known three
or four men who were young and already prominent in
Parliament, and they were undeniably interesting;
but they were generally either ugly or clumsy,&ndash;the
unpardonable sin,&ndash;or perhaps they were vain. Josephine
could not bear vain men. John Harrington probably
had some one or more of these defects. He was certainly
no &ldquo;beauty man,&rdquo; to begin with, nevertheless,
she wondered whether he might not be called handsome
by stretching a point. She rather hoped, inwardly
and unconsciously, that her ultimate judgment would
decide in favor of his good looks. She always judged;
it was the first thing she did, and she was surprised,
on the present occasion, to find her judgment so slow.
People who pride themselves on being critical are
often annoyed when they find themselves uncertain of
their own opinion. As for his accomplishments, they
were doubtful, to say the least. Miss Thorn was not
used to considering American men as manly. She had
read a great many books which made game of them, and
showed how unused they were to all those good things
which make up the life of an English country gentleman;
she had met one or two Americans who turned up their
noses in impotent scorn of all field sports except
horse-racing, which they regarded from a financial
point of view. Probably John Harrington had never
killed a pheasant in his life. Lastly, he might be
vain. A man with such a reputation for ability would
most likely be conceited.</p>

<p>And yet, despite probability, she could not help thinking
John interesting. That one speech of his about government
had meant something. He was a man with a strong personality,
with a great interest in the world led by a dominant
aspiration of some sort; and Josephine, in her heart,
loved power and admired those who possessed it. Political
power especially had that charm for her which it has
for most English people of the upper class. There
is some quality in the English race which breeds an
inordinate admiration for all kinds of superiority:
it is certain that if one class of English society
can be justly accused of an over-great veneration
for rank, the class which is rank itself is not behindhand
in doing homage to the political stars of the day.
In favor of this peculiarity of English people it
may fairly be said that they love to associate with
persons of rank and power from a disinterested love
of those things themselves, whereas in most other
countries the society of noble and influential persons
is chiefly sought from the most cynical motives of
personal advantage.</p>

<p>Politics&ndash;that is, the outward and appreciable manifestations
of political life&ndash;must always furnish abundant food
for the curiosity of the many and the intelligent
criticism of the few. There is no exception to that
rule, be the state great or small. But politics in
England and politics in America, so far as the main
points are concerned, are as different as it is possible
for any two social functions to be. Roughly, Government
and the doings of Government are centripetal in England,
and centrifugal in America. In England the will of
the people assists the workings of Providence, whereas
in America devout persons pray that Providence may
on occasion modify the will of the people. In England
men believe in the Queen, the Royal Family, the Established
Church, and Belgravia first, and in themselves afterwards.
Americans believe in themselves devoutly, and a man
who could &ldquo;establish&rdquo; upon them a church,
a royalty, or a peerage, would be a very clever fellow.</p>

<p>Josephine Thorn and John Harrington were fair examples
of their nationalities. Josephine believed in England
and the English; John Harrington believed in America
and the Americans. How far England and America are
ever likely to believe in each other, however, is a
question of future history and not of past experience,
and any reasonable amount of doubt may be cast upon
the possibility of such mutual confidence.</p>

<p>But as Josephine stood watching John Harrington while
he opened the drawing-room door for the visitor to
go out, she thought of none of these things. She certainly
did not consider herself a type of her nation&ndash;a distinction
to which few English people aspire&ndash;and she as certainly
would have denied that the man before her was a type
of the modern American.</p>

<p>John remained standing when the lady was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do sit down,&rdquo; said Miss Schenectady,
settling herself once more in her corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I think I must be going now,&rdquo;
answered John. &ldquo;It is late.&rdquo; As he spoke
he turned toward Miss Thorn, and for the first time
saw her under the bright light of the old-fashioned
gas chandelier.</p>

<p>The young girl was perhaps not what is called a great
beauty, but she was undeniably handsome, and she possessed
that quality which often goes with quick perceptions
and great activity, and which is commonly defined by
the expression &ldquo;striking.&rdquo; Short, rather
than tall, she was yet so proportioned between strength
and fineness as to be very graceful, and her head
sat proudly on her shoulders&ndash;too proudly sometimes,
for she could command and she could be angry. Her
wide brown eyes were bright and fearless and honest.
The faint color came and went under the clear skin
as freely as the heart could send it, and though her
hair was brown and soft, there were ruddy tints among
the coils, that flashed out unexpectedly here and
there like threads of red gold twined in a mass of
fine silk.</p>

<p>John looked at her in some astonishment, for in his
anxiety to be gone and in the dimness of the corner
where they had sat, he had not realized that Josephine
was any more remarkable in her appearance than most
of the extremely young women who annually make their
entrance into society, with the average stock of pink
and white prettiness. They call them &ldquo;buds&rdquo;
in Boston&ndash;an abbreviation for rosebuds.</p>

<p>Fresh young roses of each opening year, fresh with
the dew of heaven and the blush of innocence, coming
up in this wild garden of a world, what would the
gardener do without you? Where would all beauty and
sweetness be found among the thorny bushes and the
withering old shrubs and the rotting weeds, were it
not for you? Maidens with clean hands and pure hearts,
in whose touch there is something that heals the ills
and soothes the pains of mortality, roses whose petals
are yet unspotted by dust and rain, and whose divine
perfume the hot south wind has not scorched, nor the
east wind nipped and frozen&ndash;you are the protest,
set every year among us, against the rottenness of
the world&rsquo;s doings, the protest of the angelic
life against the earthly, of the eternal good against
the eternal bad.</p>

<p>John Harrington looked at Miss Thorn, and looked at
her with pleasure, for he saw that she was fair&ndash;but
in spite of her newly discovered beauty he resisted
Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s invitation to sit down again,
and departed. Any other man would have stayed, under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Josephine,&rdquo; said Miss Schenectady,
when he was gone, &ldquo;now you have seen John Harrington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josephine looked at her aunt and laughed a little;
it seemed to her a very self-evident fact, since John
had just gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you call me Joe, aunt Zoruiah? They all do at home&ndash;even
Ronald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe? Boy&rsquo;s name. Well, if you insist
upon it. As I was saying, you have seen John Harrington,
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; repeated Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I mean, how does he strike you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clever I should think,&rdquo; answered the
young lady. &ldquo;Clever, you know&ndash;that sort of
thing. Not bad looking, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said Miss Schenectady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;but I expected ever so much more from
what you said,&rdquo; returned Joe, kneeling on the
rug before the fire and poking the coals with the tongs.
Miss Schenectady looked somewhat offended at the slight
cast upon her late guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very <i>difficile</i>, Josephi&ndash;I
mean Joe, I forgot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&ndash;es, very diffyseal&ndash;that sort of thing,&rdquo;
repeated Josephine, mimicking her aunt&rsquo;s pronunciation
of the foreign word, &ldquo;I know I am, I can&rsquo;t
possibly help it, you know.&rdquo; A dashing thrust
with the tongs finally destroyed the equilibrium of
the fire, and the coals came tumbling down upon the
hearth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious me!&rdquo; exclaimed the
old lady in great anxiety, &ldquo;you will have the
house on fire in no time! Give me the tongs right away,
my dear. You do not understand American fires!&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Chapter III.</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Ronald,&ndash;You can&rsquo;t imagine what
a funny place Boston is. I wish you were here, it
would be so nice to talk about them together&ndash;I mean
the people, of course, for they are much funnier than
the place they live in. But I think they are very
nice, too, particularly some of the men. I don&rsquo;t
understand the women in the least&ndash;they go in awfully
for sets, if you understand that kind of thing&ndash;and
art, too, and literature. The other day at a lunch
party&ndash;that is what they call it here&ndash;they sat and
talked about pictures for ever so long. I wonder what
you would have said if you had been there! but then
there were no men, and so you couldn&rsquo;t have been,
could you? And the sets, too. The girls who come out
together, all in a batch, like a hive of bees swarming,
spend the rest of their lives together; and they have
what they call sewing circles, that go on all their
lives. There are sewing circles of old frumps sixty
years old who have never been parted since they all
went to their first ball together. They sew for the
poor; they don&rsquo;t sew so very much, you know;
but then they have a tremendous lunch afterwards.
I sewed for the poor the other day, because one of
the sewing circles asked me to their meeting. I sewed
two buttons on to the end of something, and then I
ate six kinds of salad, and went to drive with Mr.
Vancouver. I dare say it does a lot of good in its
way, but I think the poor must be awfully good-natured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite too funny about driving, too. You
may go out with a man in a sleigh, but you couldn&rsquo;t
possibly go with him on wheels&ndash;on the same road,
at the same hour, same man, same everything, except
the wheels. You agree to go out next week in a sleigh
with Mr. Vancouver; but when the day comes, if it
has happened to thaw and there is no snow, and he comes
in a buggy, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly go with him,
because it would be quite too improper. But I mean
to, some day, just to see what they will say. I wish
you would come! We would do a lot of driving together,
and by and by, in the spring, they say one can ride
here, but only along the roads, for everything else
is so thick with steam-engines and Irishmen that one
could not possibly go across country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But although they are so funny, they are really
very nice, and awfully clever. I don&rsquo;t think
there are nearly so many clever men anywhere else in
society, when once you have got over their Americanisms.
Most of them would be in Parliament at home; but nobody
goes into Parliament here, except Mr. Harrington&ndash;that
is, into Congress, which is the same thing, you know.
They say politics in America are not at all fit for
gentlemen, and they spend an hour or two every day
in abusing all the politicians, instead of turning
them out and managing things themselves. But Mr. Harrington
is going to be a senator as soon as he can, and he
is so clever that I am sure he will make a great reform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of anything else to say
just now, but if I do I will write again&ndash;only it&rsquo;s
unfeminine to write two letters running, so you must
answer at once. And if you should want to travel this
winter you can come here; they will treat you ever
so much better than you deserve. So good-by. Yours
ever sincerely,</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Joe</i> <i>Thorn</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The precise nature of the friendship that existed
between Josephine Thorn and Ronald Surbiton could
not be accurately inferred from the above specimen
of correspondence; and indeed the letter served rather
to confuse than to enlighten the recipient as to the
nature of his relations with the writer. He was, of
course, very much in love with Joe Thorn; he knew it,
because he had always been in love with her since they
were children together, so there could be no possible
doubt in the matter. But whether she cared a jot for
him and his feelings he could not clearly make out,
from the style of the hurried, ungrammatical sentences,
crammed with abbreviations and unpermissible elisions.
True, she said three times that she hoped he would
come to America; but America was a long way off, and
she very likely reckoned on his laziness and dislike
to foreign traveling. It is so easy for a young woman
writing from Boston to say to a young man residing
in Scotland, &ldquo;Do come over for a few days&rdquo;&ndash;Surbiton
thought it would be a good joke to take her at her
word and go. The idea of seeing her again so much
sooner than he had expected was certainly uppermost
in his mind as he began to make his resolution; but
it was sustained and strengthened by a couple of allusions
Joe had made to men of her acquaintance in Boston,
not to say by the sweeping remark that there were
more clever men in Boston society than anywhere else,
which made his vanity smart rather unpleasantly. When
Josephine used to tell him, half in earnest, half
in jest, that he was &ldquo;so dreadfully stupid,&rdquo;
he did not feel much hurt; but it was different when
she took the trouble to write all the way from America
to tell him that the men there were much cleverer than
at home. He had a great mind to go and see for himself
whether it were true. Nevertheless, the hunting was
particularly good just at the time when he got the
letter, and being rather prudent of counsel, Ronald
determined to wait until a hard frost should spoil
his temper and give the necessary stimulus to his
activity, before he packed his boxes for a western
voyage.</p>

<p>As for Josephine, it was very natural that she should
feel a little homesick, and wish to have some one
of her own people with her. In spite of the favorable
views she expressed about America, Boston, and her
new acquaintances, her position was not without some
drawbacks in her own eyes. She felt herself out of
her natural element, and the very great admiration
she received in society, though pleasant enough in
itself, was not to her so entirely satisfactory as
it would have been to a woman older or younger than
she, or to a more thorough flirt. An older woman would
have enjoyed more keenly the flattery of it; a younger
girl would have found it more novel and fresh, and
the accomplished professional society flirt&ndash;there
is no other word to express her&ndash;would have rejoiced
exceedingly over a great holocaust of victims.</p>

<p>In writing to Surbiton and suggesting to him to come
to Boston, Joe had no intention of fanning his hopes
into flame. She never thought much about Ronald. She
had long been used to him, and regarded him in the
light of a marriage fixture, though she had never
exactly promised to marry him; she had been brought
up to suppose she would, and that was all. When or
where the marriage would actually take place was a
question she did not care to raise, and if ever Surbiton
raised it she repressed him ruthlessly. For the present
she would look about the world, seeing she had been
transported into a new part of it, and she found it
amusing. Only she would like to have a companion to
whom she could talk. Ronald would be so convenient,
and after all it was a great advantage to be able to
make use of the man to whom she was engaged. She never
had known any other girl who could do that, and she
rather prided herself on the fact that she was not
ridiculous, although she was in the most traditionally
absurd position, that of betrothal. She would like
to compare Ronald with the men she had met lately.</p>

<p>The desire for comparison had increased of late. A
fortnight had passed since she had first met John
Harrington, and she had made up her mind. He was handsome,
though his hair was red and he had no beard, and she
liked him; she liked him very much; it was quite different
from her liking for Ronald. She liked Ronald, she
said to herself that she loved him dearly, partly
because she expected to marry him, and partly because
he was so good and so much in love with herself. He
would take any amount of trouble for anything she
wanted. But John was different. She knew very well
that she was thinking much more of him than he of
her, if indeed he thought of her at all. But she was
a little ashamed of it, and in order to justify herself
in her own eyes she was cold and sarcastic in her manner
to him, so that people noticed it, and even John Harrington
himself, who never thought twice whether his acquaintances
liked him or disliked him, remarked one day to Mrs.
Wyndham that he feared he had offended Miss Thorn,
as she took such particular pains to treat him differently
from others. On the other hand Joe was always extremely
candid to Pocock Vancouver.</p>

<p>It was on a Monday that John made the aforesaid remark.
All Boston was at Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s, excepting
all the other ladies who lived in Beacon Street, and
that is a very considerable portion of Boston, as every
schoolboy knows. John was standing near the tea-table
talking to Mrs. Sam, when Joe entered the room and
came up to the hostess, who welcomed her warmly. She
nodded coldly to John without shaking hands, and joined
a group of young girls near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; said John to Mrs.
Wyndham. &ldquo;I wonder whether I can have done anything
Miss Thorn resents. I am not sensitive, but it is
impossible to mistake people when they look at one
like that. She always does it just in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham looked inquiringly at John for a moment,
and the quick smile of ready comprehension played
on her sensitive mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really quite sure you have not offended
her?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; John answered, in a tone
of conviction. &ldquo;Besides, I never offend any
one, certainly not ladies. I never did such a thing
in my whole life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not singly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham, laughing.
&ldquo;You offend people in large numbers when you
do it at all, especially newspaper people. Sam read
that ridiculous article in the paper to me last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which paper?&rdquo; asked John, smiling. &ldquo;They
have most of them been at me this week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>The</i> paper,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Sam, &ldquo;the <i>horrid</i> paper. You do not
suppose I would mention such a publication in my house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my old enemy,&rdquo; laughed John. &ldquo;I
do not mind that in the least. One might almost think
those articles were written by Miss Thorn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Wyndham.
&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she added, glancing at Josephine,
whom Pocock Vancouver had just detached from her group
of girls, &ldquo;really you may not be so very, very
far wrong.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s glance followed the
direction of her eyes, and he saw Vancouver. He looked
steadily at the man&rsquo;s delicate pale features
and intellectual head, and at the end of half a minute
he and Mrs. Wyndham looked at each other again. She
probably regretted the hint she had carelessly dropped,
but she met Harrington&rsquo;s gaze frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to say it,&rdquo; she said,
for John looked so grave that she was frightened.
&ldquo;It was only a guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But have you any reason to think it might be
the truth?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatever&ndash;really none, except that he
differs so much from you in every way, politically
speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew very well that Vancouver hated John, and
she had often thought it possible that the offensive
articles in question came from the pen of the former.
There was a tone of superior wit and a ring of truer
English in them than are generally met with in the
average office work of a daily newspaper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe Vancouver writes them,&rdquo;
said John, slowly. &ldquo;He is not exactly a friend,
but he is not an enemy either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham, who knew better than that, held her
peace. She was not a mischief-maker, and moreover
she liked both the men too well to wish a quarrel
between them. She busied herself at the tea-table for
a moment, and John stood near her, watching the moving
crowd. Now and then his eyes rested on Josephine Thorn&rsquo;s
graceful figure, and he noticed how her expressive
features lighted up in the conversation. John could
hear something of their conversation, which was somewhat
noisy. They were talking in that strain of objectless
question and answer which may be stupid to idiocy
or clever to the verge of wit, according to the talkers.
Joe called it &ldquo;chaff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have learned America,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Vancouver. &ldquo;You have
not been long about it; but then, you will say there
is not much to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never believe in places till I have lived
in them,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor in people till you have seen them, I suppose,&rdquo;
returned Vancouver. &ldquo;But now that you have learned
America, of course you believe in us all without exception.
We are the greatest nation on earth&ndash;I suppose you
have heard that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; you told me so the other day; but it needs
all the faith I have in your judgment to believe it.
If any one else had said it, you know, I should have
thought there was some mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no; it is pretty true, taking it all round,&rdquo;
returned Vancouver, with a smile. &ldquo;But I am
tremendously flattered at the faith you put in my
sayings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you? That is odd, you know, because
if you are so much flattered at my believing you,
you would not be much disappointed if I doubted you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg to differ. Excuse me&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; answered Joe, laughing.
&ldquo;Only we have old-fashioned prejudices at home.
We begin by expecting to be believed, and are sometimes
a good deal annoyed if any one says we are telling
fibs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you put it in that way,&rdquo;
said Vancouver. &ldquo;But I suppose it is not a very
bad fib to say one&rsquo;s country is the greatest
on earth. I am sure you English say it quite as often
and as loudly as we do, and, you see, we cannot both
be right, possibly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly. But suppose two men, any two,
like you and Mr. Harrington for instance, each made
a point of telling every one you met that you were
the greatest man on earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is conceivable that we might both be wrong,&rdquo;
said Vancouver, laughing at the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But one of you might be right,&rdquo; objected
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;that is not conceivable,&rdquo; retorted
Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? Let us ask Mr. Harrington. Mr. Harrington!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe turned towards John and called him. He was only
a step from her, and joined the two instantly. He
looked from one to the other inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a great question to be decided, Mr.
Harrington,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I was saying to
Mr. Vancouver that, supposing each of you asserted
that he was the greatest man on earth, it would&ndash;I
mean, how could the point be settled?&rdquo; John
stared for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you insist upon raising such a very remarkable
point of precedence, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; he answered
calmly, &ldquo;I am sure Vancouver will agree with
me to leave the decision to you also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe looked slightly annoyed. She had brought the retort
on herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Vancouver, quickly,
&ldquo;I object to the contest. The match is not a
fair one. Mr. Harrington means to be the greatest man
on earth, or in the water under the earth, whereas
I have no such aspiration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of being grateful to Vancouver for coming
to her rescue in the rather foolish position in which
she was placed, Joe felt unaccountably annoyed. She
was willing to make sure of John herself, if she could,
but she was not prepared to allow that privilege to
any one else. Accordingly she turned upon Vancouver
before John could answer.  &ldquo;The question began
in a foolish comparison, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo; she
said coldly. &ldquo;I think you are inclined to make
it personal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it became personal from the moment
you hit upon Mr. Harrington and me as illustrations
of what you were saying, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; retorted
Vancouver, very blandly, but with a disagreeable look
in his eyes. He was angry at Joe&rsquo;s rebuke.</p>

<p>John stood calmly by without exhibiting the least
shade of annoyance. The chaff of a mere girl, and
the little satirical thrusts of a lady&rsquo;s man
like Vancouver, did not seem to him of much importance.
Joe, however, did not vouchsafe any answer to Vancouver&rsquo;s
last remark, and it devolved on John to say something
to relieve the awkwardness of the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you become reconciled to our methods of
amusement, Miss Thorn?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;or
shall we devise something different from the everlasting
sleighing and five o&rsquo;clock tea, and dinner parties
and &rsquo;dancing classes&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do not remind me of all that,&rdquo; said
Joe. &ldquo;I did not mean half of it, you know.&rdquo;
She turned to John, and Vancouver moved away in pursuit
of Sybil Brandon, who had just entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Joe, when Pocock was gone,
&ldquo;do you like Mr. Vancouver? You are great friends,
are you not?&rdquo; John looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not say we were very great friends,&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;because we are not intimate; but
we have always been on excellent terms, as far as I
know. Vancouver is a very clever fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I
fancy he is. You do not mind my having asked, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said John, quietly.
His face had grown very grave again, and he seemed
suddenly absorbed by some thought. &ldquo;Let us sit
down,&rdquo; he said presently, and the two installed
themselves on a divan in a corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not in the least inquisitive,&rdquo;
remarked Joe, as soon as they were settled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was such a silly thing, you know, and you
never asked what it was all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you called me? No&ndash;I did not hear what
led up to it, and I supposed from what you said afterwards
that I understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you? What did you think?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought from the question about Vancouver
that you wanted to put us into an awkward position
in order to find out whether we were friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe, with a little laugh, &ldquo;I
am not so clever as that. It was pure silliness&ndash;chaff,
you know&ndash;that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; ejaculated John, still quite unmoved,
&ldquo;then it was not of any importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very silly things sometimes turn out to be
very important. Saul, you know&ndash;was not it he?&ndash;was
looking for asses and he found a kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John laughed suddenly. &ldquo;And so it is clear which
part Vancouver and I played in the business,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But where is the kingdom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean that,&rdquo; said Joe, seriously.
&ldquo;I am not making fun any more. I have not been
successful in my chaff to-day. I should think that
in your career it would be very important for you
to know who are your friends. Is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said John, looking at her
curiously. &ldquo;It is very important; but I think
political life is generally much simpler than people
suppose. It is rather like fighting. The man who hits
you is your enemy. The man who does not is practically
your friend. Do you mean in regard to Vancouver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vancouver never hit me, that I can swear,&rdquo;
said John, &ldquo;and I am very sure I never hit him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say I am mistaken,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;You ought to know best. Let us leave him alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; answered John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you have been doing, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo;
said Joe, after a moment&rsquo;s pause; &ldquo;all
the papers are full of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been rather in the passive mood
during the last week. I have been standing up to be
shot at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without shooting back? What are they so angry
about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth,&rdquo; said John, calmly. &ldquo;They
do not like to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is truth&ndash;in this instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently something so unpleasant that the
mere mention of it has roused the bile of every penny-a-liner
in the Republican press. I undertook to demonstrate
that one of the fifteen millions of the &rsquo;ablest
men in the country,&rsquo; whom you are always hearing
about, is a swindler. He is, but he does not like
to be told so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I wonder
if any one likes unpleasant truths. But what do you
mean to do now? Are you going to fight it out? I hope
so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, in good time. One can hardly retire
from such a position as mine; they would make an end
of me in a week and quarrel over my bones. But the
real fight will be fought by and by, when the elections
come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How exciting it must all be,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;I wish I were a man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And an American?&rdquo; asked John, smiling.
&ldquo;How are the mighty fallen! You were laughing
at us and our politics the day before yesterday, and
now you are wishing you were one of us yourself. I
think you must be naturally fond of fighting&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fond of a row?&rdquo; suggested Miss Thorn,
with a laugh. &ldquo;Yes, I fancy I am. I am fond
of all active things. Are not you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I never
thought much about it. But I suppose I should be called
rather an active person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not she beautiful?&rdquo; ejaculated Miss
Thorn, looking across the room at Sybil Brandon, whose
fair head was just visible between two groups of people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked John, who was looking at
his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brandon,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Look
at her, over there. I think she is the most beautiful
thing I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;she is very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Chapter IV.</h1>

<p>All sorts and conditions of men and women elbowed
and crowded each other under the dim gaslight at the
three entrances to the Boston Music Hall. The snow
was thick on the ground outside, and it had been thawing
all the afternoon. The great booby sleighs slid and
slipped and rocked through the wet stuff, the policemen
vociferated, the horse-car drivers on Tremont Street
rang their bells furiously, and a great crowd of pedestrians
stumbled and tumbled about in the mud and slush and
snow of the crossings, all bent on getting inside
the Music Hall in time for the beginning of the lecture.</p>

<p>The affair was called a &ldquo;lecture&rdquo; in accordance
with the time-honored custom of Boston, and unless
it were termed an oration, it would be hard to find
a better name for it. A &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; implies
a number of orators, or at least a well-filled row
of chairs upon the platform. A &ldquo;lecture,&rdquo;
on the other hand, does not convey to the ordinary
mind the idea of a political speech, and critical
persons with a taste for etymology say that the word
means something which is read.</p>

<p>John Harrington had determined to speak in public
on certain subjects connected with modern politics,
and had caused the fact to be extensively made known.
His name alone would have sufficed to draw a large
audience, but the great attention he had attracted
by his doings for some time past, and the severe criticisms
lately made upon him by the local press, rendered
the interest even greater than it would otherwise have
been. Moreover, the lecture was free. Harrington was
a poor man, as fortunes go in Boston, but it was his
chiefest principle that a man had no right to be paid
for speaking the truth, even though it might sometimes
be just that people should pay something for hearing
it. Accordingly the lecture was free, and at the appointed
hour the house was full to overflowing.</p>

<p>In the front row of the first gallery sat old Miss
Schenectady, and by her side was Josephine Thorn.
A little colony of &ldquo;Beacon Street&rdquo; had
collected there, and Pocock Vancouver was not far
off. It is not often that Beacon Street goes to such
lectures, but John was one of themselves, and had too
many friends and enemies among them not to be certain
of a large attendance.</p>

<p>Miss Schenectady was there, partly because she believed
in John Harrington, and partly because Joe insisted
upon going; and, generally speaking, what Joe insisted
upon was done. The old lady did not understand why
her niece was so very anxious to be present, but as
the proposition fell in with her own desires, she
made no objection. The fact was that Joe&rsquo;s interest
in John had very greatly increased of late, and her
curiosity to hear the man she met so often speak to
a great audience was excited to its highest pitch.
She fancied, too, from many things she had heard said,
that a large proportion of his audience would be hostile
to him, and that she would see him roused to his greatest
strength and eloquence. She did not consider her impulse
in the least, for though she felt a stronger interest
in Harrington than she had ever before felt in any
individual, it had not struck her that she was beginning
to care overmuch for the sight of his face and the
sound of his voice. She could not have believed she
was beginning to love him; and if any secret voice
had suggested to her conscience that it was so, she
could have silenced it at once to her own satisfaction
by merely remembering the coldness with which she
generally treated him. She had got into the habit of
treating him in that way from the first, when she
had been prejudiced against him and the annoyance
she often felt at his indifference made her think that
she ought to be consistent and never allow her formal
manner to change. Unfortunately she now and then forgot
herself, as she had done after the little skirmish
with Vancouver at Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s, and then she
talked to him and asked him questions of himself almost
as though he were an intimate friend.</p>

<p>John, who was a man of the world as well as a man
of talent, thought she was capricious, and since he
was infinitely removed from falling in love with her,
or indeed with any other woman, he found it agreeable
to talk to her when she was in a good humor, and when
she was ungracious he merely kept out of her way.
If he had deliberately made up his mind to attract
her attention and interest, he could have chosen no
surer way than this.  But although he admired her
beauty and vivacity, and now and then took a real
pleasure in her conversation, his mind was too full
of other matters to receive any lasting impression
of such a kind. Besides, she was capricious, and he
hated mere caprice.</p>

<p>And now there was a hush in the house, and then a
short burst of applause, and Josephine, looking down,
saw John standing alone upon the platform in front
of the great bronze statue of Beethoven. He looked
exactly as he did when she met him in society; there
was no change in the even color of his face, nor any
awkwardness or self-consciousness in his easy attitude
as he stood there, broad-shouldered and square, his
strong hand just resting on the plain desk that had
been placed in the middle of the stage. He waited
a few seconds for silence in the audience, and then
began to speak. His voice sounded as natural and his
accent as unaffected as though he were talking alone
with a friend, saving only that every syllable he uttered
was audible in the furthest gallery. Josephine leaned
forward upon the red leather cushion of the railing
before her, watching and listening intently.</p>

<p>She did not understand the subject well. John Harrington
was a reformer, she knew; or, to speak more accurately,
he desired to be one. He believed great changes were
necessary. He believed in an established Civil Service,
in something which, if not exactly Free Trade, was
much nearer to it than the existing tariff. Above
all, he believed in truth and freedom instead of lying
and bribery. As he spoke and cleared the way to his
main points, his voice never quavered or faltered.
He was perfectly sure of himself, and he reserved
all his strength for the time when it should be most
required. For a quarter of an hour he proceeded, and
the people sat in dead silence before him. Then he
paused a moment, and shifted his position a little,
moving a step forward as though to gain a better hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am coming to the point,&rdquo; he said,&ndash;&ldquo;the
point that I must come to sooner or later. I am a
Democrat, as perhaps some of you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here there was an uneasy movement in the house. &ldquo;Yes,
I guess you are!&rdquo; cried a voice from somewhere,
in a tone of high nasal irony. Some one laughed, and
some one hissed, and then there was silence again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; continued John, unmoved by
the interruption. &ldquo;I am a Democrat, and though
the sight does not astonish you so much as it might
have done twenty years ago, it is worthy of remark,
nevertheless. But I have a peculiarity which I think
you will allow to be extremely novel. I do not begin
by saying that salvation is only to be found with
Democrats, and I will not believe any man who says
it belongs exclusively to Republicans. If we were
suddenly put in great danger of any kind, war, famine,
or revolution, I think that in some way or other we
should manage to save the country between us, Republicans
and Democrats, for the common good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; said more than one
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we should. Is there any one among
us all who would not give up his individual views
about a local election rather than see the country
go to pieces? Would any man be such a coward as to
be afraid to change his mind in order to prevent another
Rebellion, another Civil War? No, no, we are more
civilized than that. We want our own men in Congress,
our own friends in office, just so long as they are
serviceable&ndash;just so long as the country can stand
it, if you like it in that way. But if it comes to
be a question between the public good and having your
cousin made postmaster in a country village, I think
there is enough patriotism in the average Democrat
or Republican to send the country cousin about his
business. If worst comes to worst, we can save the
country between us, depend upon it. We have done it
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here there was a burst of willing applause. It is
a great point to bring an audience into the position
of applauding themselves.</p>

<p>Joe watched John&rsquo;s every gesture, and listened
intently to every word. His voice rang clear and strong
through the great hall, and he was beginning to be
roused. He had gained a decided advantage in the success
of his last words, and as he gathered his strength
for the real effort which was to come, his cheek paled
and his gray eyes grew brighter. He spoke out again
through the subsiding clamor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I say that the country is in danger. It
is in very great danger, the greatest danger that
can threaten any community. The institutions of a
nation are like the habits of a man, except that they
are harder to improve and easier to spoil. We have
got into bad habits, and if we do not mend them they
will take us to a more certain destruction than revolution,
famine, or war,&ndash;or all three together. It is easier
to fight a thing that has a head to it and a name,
than a thing that is everywhere and has no name, because
no one has the courage to christen it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are like a man who has grown from being
a peddler of tape and buttons to be the greatest dry-goods-man
in his town, and then to being a great dealer for
many towns. When he was a peddler he could carry the
profit and loss on his buttons and tape in his head,
because the profits were literally in his pocket,
and the losses were literally out of it. But when
he has grown into a great merchant he must keep books,
and he must keep a great many of them, and they must
be kept accurately, or he will get into trouble and
go to ruin. That is true, is it not? And when he was
a peddler he could buy his stock-in-trade himself,
and be sure that it was what he wanted; but when he
is one of the great merchants he must employ other
people to help him, and unless they are the right people
and understand the business, he will be ruined. Nobody
can deny that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. We began in a small way as a nation,
without much stock-in-trade, and we kept our accounts
by rule of thumb. But it seems to me we are doing
a pretty large business as a nation just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a laugh, and sundry remarks to the effect
that the audience understood what John was driving
at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are doing a great business, and to
all intents and purposes we are doing it on false
business principles, and with an absolutely incompetent
staff of clerks. What would you think of a merchant
who dismissed all his book-keepers every four years,
and engaged a set of shoemakers, or tailors, or artists,
or musicians to fill up the vacancies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low murmur ran through the hall, a murmur of disapprobation.
Probably a large number out of the three thousand
men and women present had cousins in country post
offices. But John did not pause; his voice grew full
and clear, ringing high above the dull sounds in the
house. From her place in the gallery Josephine looked
down, never taking her eyes from the face of the orator.
She too was pale with excitement; had she been willing
to acknowledge it, it was fear. That deep-toned beginning
of a protest from the great concourse was like an
omen of failure to her sensitive ear. She longed to
see John Harrington succeed and carry his hearers with
him into an access of enthusiasm. John expected no
such thing. He only wanted the people to understand
thoroughly what he meant, for he was sure that if
once they knew the truth clearly they would feel for
it as he himself did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I
tell you that is what we are doing, what we have been
doing for years, from the very beginning. And if we
go on doing it we shall get into trouble. We choose
schoolboys to do the work of men, we expect that by
the mere signature of the head of the executive any
man can be turned into an accomplished public officer
fit to be compared with one whose whole life has been
spent in the public service. We wish to be represented
abroad among foreign nations in a way becoming to our
dignity and very great power, and we select as our
ministers a number of gentlemen who in most cases
have never read a diplomatic dispatch in their  lives,
and who sometimes are not even acquainted with any
language save their own. Perhaps you will say that
our dignity is not of much importance provided our
power is great enough. I do not think you will say
it, but there are communities in our country where
it would most certainly be said. Very well, so be
it. But where do you think our power comes from? Do
you think there is a boundless store of some natural
product called power, of which we need only take as
much as we want in order to stand a head and shoulders
higher than any other nation in the world? What is
power? Can a man be strong if he has an internal disease,
or is his strength any use to him if his arms and
legs are out of joint? Would you believe in the strength
of a great firm that hired a company of actors from
a theatre, and made the tragedian cashier and the
low-comedy man head book-keeper?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sick man may live for years with his sickness,
and the man whose limbs are all distorted may still
deal a formidable blow with his head, if it is thick
enough. The firm may prosper for a time with its staff
of theatrical clerks, provided there is enough business
to pay for all their mistakes and leave a margin of
profit. But the sick man does not live because he
is diseased, but in spite of it. The distorted joints
of the cripple do not help him to fight. The firm
is not rich because its business is done by tragedians
and walking-gentlemen, but in spite of them. If the
doctor fails to give his medicine, if the fighting
grows too rough for the cripple, if business grows
slack, or if some good business man with competent
assistants starts a strong opposition&ndash;what happens?
What must inevitably happen? Why, the sick man dies,
the cripple gets the worst of it, and the theatrical
firm of merchants goes straight into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I tell you that we are in danger. We
are sick with the foul disease of office seeking;
we are crippled hand and foot not only for fighting
but for working, because our public officers are inexperienced
men who spend four years in learning a trade not theirs,
and are very generally turned out before they have
half learnt it; we are doing a political business
which will succeed fairly well just so long as we are
rich enough to provide funds for any amount of extravagance
and keep enough in our pockets to buy bread and cheese
with afterwards. Just so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we have been lanced here in Boston and
the blood is running freely, we can still cut a slice
out of the West and use it like court-plaster to stop
the bleeding. Some day there will be no more slices
to be had. It will be a bad day in State Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This remark raised a laugh and a good deal of noise
for a moment. But the audience were soon silent again.
Whether they meant to approve or disapprove, they
kept their opinions to themselves. Miss Thorn did not
comprehend the allusion, but she was listening with
all her ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understand that,&rdquo; John went on. &ldquo;Then
understand it about the rest of the country as well.
Understand that we are all the time patching our income
with our capital; and it answers pretty well because
there is a good deal of capital and not so very many
of ourselves, as yet. There will be twice as many
of us in a few years, and very much less than half
as much capital. Understand above all that we are
getting into bad habits&ndash; habits we should despise
in a corporation, and condemn by very bad names in
any individual man of our acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when you have understood it, look at matters
as they stand. Look at the incompetence of our public
officers, look at our ruined carrying trade, at those
vile enactions of fools, and worse than fools, the
Navigation Laws of the United States, and tell me whether
things are as they should be. Tell me what has become
of liberty if you cannot buy a ship where you can
get her best and cheapest, and hoist your own flag
upon her, and call her your own? You may pay for her
and bring her home with you, but though she were ten
times paid for, you cannot hoist the American flag,
nor register her in your own port, nor claim the protection
of your country for your own property&ndash;because, forsooth,
the ship was not built on American stocks, where she
would cost three times her value, and put a job into
the hands of a set of builders of river steamboats
and harbor mudscows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud murmurs ran through the audience, and cries of
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; and counter cries of
&ldquo;Freetrader!&rdquo; were heard on all sides.
John&rsquo;s great voice rang out like a trumpet.
He knew the sensitiveness of his townsmen on the point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not speaking against protection,&rdquo;
he said, and at the magic word &ldquo;protection&rdquo;
a dead silence again fell over the vast crowd. &ldquo;I
say to you,  &lsquo;Protect!&rsquo; Protect, all of
you, merchants, tradesmen, the great body of the commerce
of this country; protect whatever you all decide together
needs protection. But by the greatness and the power
you have, by the Heaven that gave us this land of
ours to till and to enjoy, protect also yourselves
and your liberties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A patriotic phrase in the mouth of a man who has the
golden gift of speech, coupled with the statement
of a principle popular with his audience, is a sure
point in an oration. Something in John&rsquo;s tone
and gesture touched the sympathetic chord, and the
house broke out in a great cry of applause.</p>

<p>An orator cannot always talk in strict logical sequence.
He must search about for the right nail till he has
found it, and then drive it home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, that is the point,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
men of Boston here, look to your harbors, crowded
with English craft, and think of what is gone, lost
to you forever, unless you will strike a blow for
it. Many of you are old enough to remember how it
used to be. Look at Salem Harbor, at Marblehead. Where
are the fleets of noble ships that lay side by side
along the great docks, the ships that did half the
carrying trade of the world? Where are the great merchantmen
that used to sail so grandly away to the East and
that came home so richly laden? They are sunk or gone
to pieces, or sold as old timber and copper and nails
to the gentlemen who build mudscows. What are the
great merchants doing who owned those fleets? They
are employing their time in building railroads with
English iron and foreign labor into desolate deserts
in the West, which they hope to sell for a handsome
profit, and probably will. But when there are no more
desolate deserts and English iron and foreign labor
to be had, they will wish they had their ships again,
and that in all these years they had got possession
of the carrying trade of the world, as they might have
done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I am here to say. The time is
come to give up the shifts and unstable expedients
that we needed, or thought we needed, in our early
beginnings. Let us pull down all these scaffoldings
and stages that have helped us to build, and let us
see whether our fabric will stand upon its base, erect,
without the paltry support of a few rotting timbers.
Let us substitute the permanent for the transitory,
the stable for the unstable, and the reality for the
sham. Let us have a Civil Service in fact as well
as in name, a service of men trained to their duties,
and who shall spend their lives in fulfilling them;
a service of competent men to represent us abroad,
and a service of honest men to do the country&rsquo;s
business at home, instead of making the country do
theirs and being paid for it into the bargain. Let
us put men into Congress who will cover the seas with
our ships again, as well as make our harbors impassable
with a competition of cheap ferry-boats. Begin here,
as you began here more than a hundred years ago, and
as you succeeded then you will succeed now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin, and go on, and God prosper you; and
when the work is done, when bribery and extortion
and all corruption are crushed forever out of our
public life, when the Navigation Act is a thing of
the past, and you are again the carriers of the world&rsquo;s
commerce as well as the greatest sharers in it, then
it will be time enough to give a name to the men who
shall have done all these things, Republicans and
Democrats together, a new party, the last and the
greatest of all parties that the country has ever
seen. You will find a name, surely enough, that will
answer the purpose then; but whatever that name may
be, it will not be forgotten that, for the third time
in the history of our land, Massachusetts has struck
the first and the strongest blow in the struggle for
liberty, honor, and truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few men in public life had as good a right as John
Harrington to denounce all manner of dishonesty. Many
a speaker would have raised a sneering laugh by that
last phrase, but even John&rsquo;s enemies admitted
that his hands were clean. Coming from one of themselves
it was a strong appeal, and the applause was long
and loud. With a courteous inclination John turned
and left the platform through the door at the back.</p>

<p>He was well enough satisfied. His hearers had been
moved for a moment to enthusiasm. They would go home
and on mature reflection would not agree with him;
but a blow struck is a point in the fight so long as
it is felt at all, and John was well pleased at the
reception he had met with. He had avoided every detail,
and had confined himself to the widest generalities,
but his homely illustrations would not be forgotten,
and his strong individuality had created a sincere
desire in many who had been there that night to hear
him speak again.</p>

<p>For some minutes after John had left the platform,
Josephine sat unmoved in her seat beside her aunt,
lost in thought as she watched the surging crowd below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Schenectady, &ldquo;you
have heard John Harrington now.&rdquo; Joe started.
She had grown used to the implied interrogation her
aunt usually conveyed in that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a great man, Aunt Zo&euml;,&rdquo; she said
quietly, and looked round. There was a moisture in
her beautiful brown eyes that told of great excitement.
She was very pale too, and looked tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; said Aunt Zoruiah. &ldquo;But
we had better go home right away, Joe darling. You
are so pale, I suppose you must be a good deal used
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me to see you to your carriage,&rdquo;
said Pocock Vancouver in dulcet tones, coming up to
the two ladies as they rose.</p>

<h1>Chapter V.</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you get in, Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo;
inquired Miss Schenectady, when she and Joe were at
last packed into the deep booby. It was simply a form
of invitation. There was no reason why Mr. Vancouver
should not get in, and with a word of thanks he did
so. Ten minutes later the three were seated round
the fire in Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was very fine, was it not, Miss Thorn?&rdquo;
said Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe, staring at the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some people,&rdquo; said Miss Schenectady,
&ldquo;it does not seem to make much difference what
they say, but it is always fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that ironical?&rdquo; asked Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, goodness gracious no! Of course not! I
am John Harrington&rsquo;s very best friend. I only
mean to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Aunt Zo&euml; ?&rdquo; inquired Joe, not yet
altogether accustomed to the peculiar implications
of her aunt&rsquo;s language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what I said, of course; it sounds very
fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you do not believe it all?&rdquo; asked
Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand politics,&rdquo; said
the old lady. &ldquo;You might ring the bell, Joe,
and ask Sarah for some tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody understands politics,&rdquo; said Vancouver.
&ldquo;When people do, there will be an end of them.
Politics consist in one half of the world trying to
drive paradoxes down the throats of the other half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe laughed a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know anything about politics here,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;though I do at home, of course. I
must say, though, Mr. Harrington did not seem so very
paradoxical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; answered Vancouver, blandly,
&ldquo;I did not mean in this case. Harrington is
very much in earnest. But it is like war, you see.
When every one understands it thoroughly, it will
stop by universal consent. Did you ever read Bulwer&rsquo;s
&rsquo;Coming Race&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I always read
those books. <i>Vril</i>, and that sort of thing,
you mean? Oh yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Approximately,&rdquo; answered Vancouver. &ldquo;It
was an allegory, you know. A hundred years hence people
will write a book to explain what Bulwer meant. <i>Vril</i>
stands for the cumulative power of potential science,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Bulwer&rsquo;s word shorter, and a
good deal easier to understand,&rdquo; said Joe, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a great thing to be great,&rdquo; remarked
Miss Schenectady. &ldquo;Sarah, I think you might
bring us some tea, please, and ask John if he couldn&rsquo;t
stir the furnace a little. And then to have people
explain you. Goethe must be a good deal amused, I
expect, when people write books to prove that Byron
was Euphorion.&rdquo; Miss Schenectady was fond of
German literature, and the extent of her reading was
a constant surprise to her niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lot of things you know, Aunt Zo&euml; !&rdquo;
said Joe. &ldquo;But what had Bulwer to do with war,
Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, in the book&ndash;the &lsquo;Coming Race,&rsquo;
you know&ndash;they abolished war because they could kill
each other so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How nice that would be!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe,
looking at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you perfectly shock me, Joe,&rdquo; cried
Miss Schenectady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, to have no war,&rdquo; returned Joe,
sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh; I belonged to the Peace Conference myself,&rdquo;
said her aunt, immediately pacified. &ldquo;Well,
yes. Perhaps you could bring us a little cake, Sarah?
War is a terrible thing, my dear, as Mr. Vancouver
will tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vancouver, however, was silent. He probably did not
care to have it remembered that he was old enough
to carry a musket in the Rebellion. Joe understood
and asked no Questions about it, and Vancouver was
grateful for her tact. She rose and began to pour
out some tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You began talking about Mr. Harrington&rsquo;s
speech,&rdquo; said she presently, &ldquo;but we got
away from the subject. Is it all true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is scarcely a fair question, Miss Thorn,&rdquo;
answered Vancouver. &ldquo;You see, I belong to the
opposite party in politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Harrington said he wanted both parties
to combine. Besides, you do not take any active part
in it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have very strong opinions, nevertheless,&rdquo;
replied Pocock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strong opinions and activity ought to go together,&rdquo;
said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you have strong opinions and disagree
with Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; persisted Miss Thorn,
&ldquo;then you have a strong opinion against your
two parties acting together for the common good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that,&rdquo; said Vancouver, embarrassed
between the directness of Joe&rsquo;s question and
a very strong impression that he had better not say
anything against John Harrington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what do you believe? Will you please give
this cup to Miss Schenectady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vancouver rose quickly to escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cream and sugar, Miss Schenectady?&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Ah, Miss Thorn has already put them in.
It is such celebrated tea of yours! Do you know, I
always look forward to a cup of it as one of the greatest
pleasures in life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you have quite done praising the tea,
will you please tell me what you believe about Mr.
Harrington&rsquo;s speech?&rdquo; said the inexorable
Joe, drowning her aunt&rsquo;s reply to Vancouver&rsquo;s
polite remark.</p>

<p>Thus cornered, Vancouver faced the difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it was a very good speech,&rdquo;
he said mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe what he said was true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great deal of it was true, but I assure you
that Harrington is very enthusiastic. Much of it was
extremely imaginative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say; all that about making a Civil Service,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly. I think all good Republicans
hope to have a regular Civil Service some day. It
is necessary, or will be so before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then it is what he said about that ridiculous
Navigation Act that you object to?&rdquo; pursued
Joe, without mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I think it would be an advantage to
repeal it. It is only kept up for the sake of a few
builders who have influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; exclaimed Joe triumphantly,
&ldquo;you think the hope he expressed that bribery
and that sort of thing might be suppressed was altogether
imaginary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not, Miss Thorn. But I am sure there
is not nearly so much of it as he made out. It was
a very great exaggeration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there? Really, he only used the word once
in the most general way. I remember very well, at
the end; he said, &rsquo;when bribery, corruption,
and all extortion are crushed forever;&rsquo; anybody
might say that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make out a wonderfully good case, Miss
Thorn,&rdquo; said Vancouver, who was not altogether
pleased; &ldquo;was the speech printed before Harrington
spoke it this evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. &ldquo;I have a very
good memory, in that way, just to remember what I
hear. I could repeat word for word everything he said,
and everything you have said since during the evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a terrible person you are!&rdquo; said
Vancouver, smiling pleasantly. &ldquo;Well, then,
now that you have proved every word of Harrington&rsquo;s
speech out of an opponent&rsquo;s evidence, I will
tell you frankly how it is that I do not agree with
him. He is a Democrat, I am a Republican. That is the
whole story. I do not believe, nor shall I ever believe,
that any large number of the two parties can work
together. I cannot help my belief in the least; it
is a matter of conscience. Nevertheless, I have a very
great respect for Harrington, and as I take no active
part whatever in any political contest, my opinion
of his politics will never interfere with my personal
feeling for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frankness seemed to be Mr. Vancouver&rsquo;s strong
point. Joe was obliged to admit that he spoke clearly,
even if she did not greatly respect his logic. During
all this time, Miss Schenectady had been sipping her
tea in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;you are
a perfect Socrates for questions. You ought to have
been a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I were,&rdquo; said Joe, laughing, &ldquo;or
Socrates himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you ought to have been. Here you know
nothing at all about this thing, and you have been
talking like anything for half an hour. I think Socrates
was perfectly horrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Vancouver, laughing aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Joe asked, turning to her aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be always stopping people in the street,
and button-holing them with his questions. Of course
it was very clever, as Plato makes it out; but I do
wish he could have met me&ndash;when I was young, my dear.
I would have answered him once and for all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try me, Aunt Zo&euml;, for practice,&rdquo; said
Joe, &ldquo;until you meet him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I expect you would do almost as well.
Look at Mr. Vancouver, he is quite used up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The case was not so serious with Mr. Vancouver as
the old lady made it out to be. He was silent and
to all intents vanquished for the present, but it
was not long before he turned the conversation to other
things, and succeeded in making himself very agreeable.
He admired Josephine very much, and though she occasionally
made him feel very uncomfortable, he always returned
to the charge with renewed intelligence and sweetness.
Joe liked him too, in spite of an unfounded suspicion
she felt that he was dangerous. He was always ready
when she needed anything at a party; he never bored
her, but whenever he saw she was wearied by any one
else he came up and saved her, clearing a place for
himself at her side with an ease that bespoke long
and constant experience of the world. Women, especially
young women, always like men of that description; they
are flattered at the attention of a man who is so
evidently able to choose, and they enjoy the immunity
from all annoyance and weariness that such men are
able to carry with them.</p>

<p>Consequently Joe accepted the attentions of Pocock
Vancouver with a certain amount of satisfaction, and
she had not been displeased that he should come to
Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s house for tea. The evening
passed quickly, and Vancouver took his leave. As he
opened the front door to let himself out he nearly
fell over a small telegraph messenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thorn here?&rdquo; inquired the boy, laconically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take it in,&rdquo; said Vancouver
quickly. He went back with the telegram, and the boy
stood inside the door waiting for the receipt. He
noticed the stamp of the Cable Office on the envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thorn,&rdquo; said Vancouver, entering
the drawing-room again, hat in hand, &ldquo;I just
met this telegram on the steps, so I brought it in.
It may need an answer, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, so much,&rdquo; said Joe, tearing open
the pale yellow cover. She was startled, not being
accustomed to receive telegrams. Her brow contracted
as she read the contents, and she tapped her small
foot on the carpet impatiently.</p>

<blockquote><span class="smallcaps">Thorn</span>, care Schenectady,<br>
Beacon, Boston.<br>
Sailed to-day.<br>
<span class="smallcaps">Ronald</span>.</blockquote>

<p>Josephine crushed the paper in her hand and signed
the receipt with the pencil Vancouver offered her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, so much,&rdquo; she said again, but
in a different tone of voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any answer?&rdquo; suggested Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, no,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;Good-night
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo; And Vancouver departed,
wondering what the message could have been.</p>

<p>Miss Schenectady had looked on calmly throughout the
little scene, and nodded to Pocock as he left the
room; her peculiarities were chiefly those of diction;
she was a well-bred old lady, not without wisdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong, Joe?&rdquo; she inquired, when
alone with her niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;Ronald
has just sailed from England. I suppose he will be
here in ten days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business here?&rdquo; asked Miss Schenectady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no! He knows nothing about business.
I wish he would stay at home. What a bore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was evident that Joe had changed her mind since
she had written to Ronald a fortnight before. It seemed
to her now, when she looked forward to Surbiton&rsquo;s
coming, that he would not find his place in Boston
society so easily as she had done. Of course he would
expect to see her every day, and to spend all his
leisure hours at Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s house. Whatever
she happened to be doing, it would always be necessary
to take Ronald into consideration, and the prospect
did not please her at all.</p>

<p>Ronald was a dear good fellow, of course, and she
meant to marry him in the end&ndash;at least, she probably
would. But then, she intended to marry him at a more
convenient season, some time in the future. She knew
him well, and she was certain that when he saw her
surrounded by her Boston acquaintances, his British
nature would assert itself, and he would claim her,
or try to claim her, and persuade her to go away. She
bid Miss Schenectady good night, and went to her room;
and presently, when she was sure every one was in
bed in the house, she stole down to the drawing-room
again, and sat alone by the remains of the coal-fire,
thinking what she should do.</p>

<p>Josephine Thorn was young and more full of life and
activity than most girls of her age. She enjoyed what
came in her way to enjoy with a passionate zest, and
she had the reputation of being somewhat capricious
and changeable. But she was honest in all her thoughts,
and very clear-sighted. People often said she spoke
her mind too freely, and was not enough in awe of
the veiled deity known in society as &ldquo;The  Thing.&rdquo;
How she hated it! How many times she had been told
that what she said and did was not quite &ldquo;The
Thing.&rdquo; She knew now what Ronald would say when
he came, if he found her worshiped on all sides by
Pocock Vancouver and his younger and less accomplished
compeers. Ronald would say &ldquo;it was rather rough,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sat by the fire and thought the matter over, and
when she came to formulating in her mind the exact
words that Ronald would say, she paused to think of
him and how he would look. He was handsome&ndash;far handsomer
than Vancouver or&ndash;or John Harrington. He was very
nice; much nicer than Vancouver. John Harrington was
different, &ldquo;nice&rdquo; did not describe him;
but Ronald was nicer than all the other men she knew.
He would make a charming husband. At the thought Joe
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband!&rdquo; she repeated aloud to herself
in the silence. Then she rose quickly to her feet
and leaned against the smooth white marble mantelpiece,
and buried her face in her small white hands for an
instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, no, no!&rdquo; she cried aloud.
&ldquo;It is impossible; oh no! never! I never really
meant it; did I?&rdquo; She stared at herself in the
glass for a few seconds, and her face was very pale.
Then she bent over her hands again, and the tears
came and wetted them a little, and at last she sat
down as she had sat before, and stared vacantly at
the fire.</p>

<p>It would be very wrong to break Ronald&rsquo;s heart,
she thought. He would come to her so full of hope
and gladness; how could she tell him she did not love
him?</p>

<p>But how was it possible that in all these years she
had never before understood that she could not marry
him? It had always seemed so natural to marry Ronald.
And yet she must have always really felt just as she
did to-night; only she had never realized it, never
at all. Why had it come over her so suddenly too?
It would have been so much better if she could  have
seen the truth at home, before she parted from him;
for it would be so hard for him to bear it now, after
coming across the ocean to see her &ndash;so cruelly hard.
Dear Ronald; and yet he must be told.</p>

<p>Yes, there was no doubt about it, the very first meeting
must explain it to him. He would say&ndash;what would he
say? He would tell her she liked some one else better.</p>

<p>Some one else! Some one who had stolen away her heart;
of course he would say that. But he would be wrong,
for there was no one else, not one of all these men
she had seen, who had so much as breathed a word of
love to her. None whom she liked nearly so much as
Ronald, no, not one.</p>

<p>For a long time she sat very quietly, following a
train of thought that was half unconscious. Her lips
moved now and then, as though she were repeating something
to herself, and gradually the pained and anxious expression
of her face melted away into a look of peace.</p>

<p>The old gilt clock upon the chimney-piece struck twelve
in its shrill steel tones. Josephine started at the
sound, and passed one hand over her eyes as though
to rouse herself, and at the same time a deep blush
spread over her delicate cheek. For with the voice
of midnight there was also the voice of a man ringing
in her ears, and she heard the two together, so that
it seemed as though all the world must hear them also,
and her gentle maiden&rsquo;s soul was shamed at the
thought.</p>

<p>So it is that our loves are always with us, and though
we search ourselves diligently to find them and rebuke
them, we find them not; but if we give up searching
they come upon us unawares, and speak very soft words.
Love also is a gentle thing, full of sweetness and
peace, when he comes to us so; and though the maiden
blushes at his speaking, she would not stop the ears
of her heart against him for all the world; and although
the boy trembles and turn pale, and forgets to be
boyish when, the fit is on him, nevertheless he goes
near and worships, and loses his heart in learning
a  new language. So kind and soft is love, so tender
and sweet-spoken, that you would think he would not
so much as ruffle the leaf of a rose, nor breathe
too sharply on a violet, lest he should hurt the flower-soul
within; and if you treat him hospitably he is kind
to the last, so that when he is gone there is still
a sweet savor of him left. But if you would drive
him roughly away with scorn and rude language, he will
stand at your door and will not leave you. Then his
wings drop from him, and he grows strong and fierce,
and deadly and beautiful, as the fallen archangel of
heaven, crying aloud bitter things to you by day and
night; till at the last he will break down bolt and
bar and panel, and enter your chamber, and drag you
out with him to your death in the wild darkness.</p>

<p>But Josephine blushed deeply there in the old-fashioned
drawing-room at midnight, and as she turned away she
wondered at herself, for she could not believe nor
understand what was happening.</p>

<p>Poor girl! She had talked of love so often as an abstract
thing, she had seen so many love-makings of others,
and so many men had tried to make love to her in her
short brilliant life, and she had always thought it
could not come near her, because, of course, she really
loved Ronald. She had marveled, indeed, at what people
were willing to do, and at what they were ready to
sacrifice, for a feeling that seemed to her of such
little importance as that. It had been an illusion,
and the waking had come at last very suddenly. Whoever
it might be whom she was destined to take, it was
not Ronald. It was madness to think she could be bound
forever to him, however much she might admire him
and desire him as a friend.</p>

<p>When the clock struck she was thinking of John, and
the words he had said that night to his great audience
were ringing again in her ears. She blushed indeed
at the idea that she was thinking so much of him, but
it was not that she believed she loved him. If as
yet she really did, she was herself most honestly
unconscious of it; and so the blush was not accounted
for in the reckoning she made.</p>

<p>She lay awake long, trying to determine what was best
to be done, but she could not. One thing she must
do; she must explain to Ronald, when he  came, that
she could never, never marry him.</p>

<p>If only she had a sister, or some one! Dear Aunt Zoruiah
was so horrid about such things that it was impossible
to talk to her!</p>

<h1>Chapter VI.</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know how to skate?&rdquo; Sybil Brandon
asked of Joe as the two young girls, clad in heavy
furs, walked down the sunny side of Beacon Street two
days later. They were going from Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s
to a &ldquo;lunch party&rdquo;&ndash; one of those social
institutions of Boston which had most surprised Joe
on her first arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;I do
not know anything, but I can do everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How nice!&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;Then you
can go with us to-night. That will be too lovely!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all going skating on Jamaica Pond. Nobody
has skated for so long here that it is a novelty.
I used to be so fond of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We always skate at home, when there is ice,&rdquo;
said Joe. &ldquo;It will be enchanting though, with
the full moon and all. What time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sam Wyndham will arrange that,&rdquo;
said Sybil. &ldquo;She is going to matronize us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dreadful, to have to be chaperoned!&rdquo;
ejaculated Joe. &ldquo;But Mrs. Wyndham is very jolly
after all, so it does not much matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe they used to have Germans here without
any mothers,&rdquo; remarked Sybil, &ldquo;but they
never do now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little things, how awfully lonely for
them!&rdquo; laughed Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Germans&ndash;without their mothers. Oh, I forgot
the German was the cotillon. You mean cotillons, without
tapestry, as we say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly. But about the skating party.
It will be very select, you know; just ourselves.
You know I never go out,&rdquo; Sybil added rather
sadly, &ldquo;but I do love skating so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are &rsquo;ourselves&rsquo;&ndash;exactly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you and I, and the Sam Wyndhams, and the
Aitchison girls, and Mr.<br>
Topeka, and Mr. Harrington, and Mr. Vancouver&ndash;let
me see&ndash;and Miss St.<br>
Joseph, and young Hannibal. He is very nice, and is
very attentive to Miss<br>
St. Joseph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it nice, like that, skating about in couples?&rdquo;
asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; that is the disagreeable part; but the
skating is delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us stay together all the time,&rdquo; said
Joe spontaneously, &ldquo;it will be ever so much
pleasanter. I would not exactly like to be paired off
with any of those men, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil looked at Joe, opening her wide blue eyes in
some astonishment. She did not think Joe was exactly
one of those young women who object to a moonlight
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, if properly chaperoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
would like it much better myself, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Sybil,&rdquo; said Joe, looking
up at her taller companion, &ldquo;I should not think
you would care for skating and that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not look strong enough. You are not
a bit like me, brought up on horseback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am very strong,&rdquo; answered Sybil,
&ldquo;only I am naturally pale, you see, and people
think I am delicate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the north wind kissed her fair face and the faint
color came beneath the white and through it, so that
Joe looked at her and thought she was the fairest
woman in the world that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was a little girl,&rdquo; said Joe,
&ldquo;mamma used to tell me a story about the beautiful
Snow Angel: she must have been just like you, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the story?&rdquo; asked Sybil, the
delicate color in her cheek deepening a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you to-night when we are skating,
we have not time now. Here we are.&rdquo; And the
two girls went up the steps of the house where they
were going to lunch.</p>

<p>On the other side of the street Pocock Vancouver and
John Harrington met, and stopped to speak just as
Joe and Sybil had rung the bell, and stood waiting
at the head of the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us look at each other so long
as we can look at them,&rdquo; said Vancouver, shaking
hands with John, but looking across the street at the
two girls. John looked too, and both men bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are pretty enough for anything, are they
not?&rdquo; continued Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;they are very
pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a nod and a smile Joe and Sybil disappeared into
the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you marry her?&rdquo; asked
Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which? The English girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Sybil Brandon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I am not thinking of being married,&rdquo;
said John, a half-comic, half-contemptuous look in
his strong face. &ldquo;Miss Brandon could do better
than marry a penniless politician, and besides, even
if I wanted it, I care too much for Miss Brandon&rsquo;s
friendship to risk losing it by asking her to marry
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Vancouver,
&ldquo;she would accept you straight off. So would
the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to know,&rdquo; said John, eyeing
his companion calmly.</p>

<p>Vancouver looked away; it was generally believed that
he had been refused by Miss Brandon more than a year
previous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can take my word for it, you could
not do better,&rdquo; he answered, ambiguously. &ldquo;There
is no knowing how the moonlight effects on Jamaica
Pond may strike you this evening. I say, though, you
were pretty lucky in having such warm weather the
night before last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;The house was
full. Were you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. If I were not a Republican I would
congratulate you on your success. It is a long time
since any one has made a Boston audience listen to
those opinions. You did it surprisingly well; that
sentence about protection was a masterpiece. I wish
you were one of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no use arguing with you,&rdquo; said
John. &ldquo;If it were, I could make a Democrat of
you in an afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I make a pretty good thing of arguing, though,&rdquo;
answered the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my trade, you
see, and it is not yours. You lay down the law; it
is my business to make a living out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I <i>could</i> lay it down, as
you say, and lay it down according to my own ideas,&rdquo;
said John. &ldquo;I would have something to say to
you railroad men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for that, I should not care. Railroad law
is stronger than iron and more flexible than india-rubber,
and the shape of it is of no importance whatever.
So long as there is enough of it to work with, you
can twist it and untwist it as much as you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would simplify matters to untwist it and
cut it up into lengths,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
then your occupation would be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think my occupation will last my life-time,&rdquo;
answered Vancouver, laughing in his turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it,&rdquo; returned John.
&ldquo;But we can provide you with another. Good-by.
I am going to Cambridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They shook hands cordially, and John Harrington turned
down Charles Street, while Vancouver pursued his way
up the hill. He had been going in the opposite direction
when he met Harrington, but he seemed to have changed
his mind. He was not seen again that day until he went
to dine with Mrs. Sam Wyndham.</p>

<p>There was no one there but Mr. Topeka and young John
C. Hannibal, well-dressed men of five-and-thirty
and five-and-twenty respectively, belonging to good
families of immense fortune, and educated regardless
of expense. No homely Boston phrase defiled their
anglicized lips, their great collars stood up under
their chins in an ecstasy of stiffness, and their shirt-fronts
bore two buttons, avoiding the antiquity of three and
the vulgarity of one. Well-bred Anglo-maniacs both,
but gentlemen withal, and courteous to the ladies.
Mr. Topeka was a widower, John C. Hannibal was understood
to be looking for a wife.</p>

<p>They came, they dined, and they retired to Sam Wyndham&rsquo;s
rooms to don their boots and skating clothes. At nine
o&rsquo;clock the remaining ladies arrived, and then
the whole party got into a great sleigh and were driven
rapidly out of town over the smooth snow to Jamaica
Pond. John Harrington had not come, and only three
persons missed him&ndash;Joe Thorn, Mrs. Sam, and Pocock
Vancouver.</p>

<p>The ice had been cut away in great quantities for
storing and the thaw had kept the pond open for a
day or two. Then came the sharpest frost of the winter,
and in a few hours the water was covered with a broad
sheet of black ice that would bear any weight. It
was a rare piece of good fortune, but the fashion
of skating had become so antiquated that no one took
advantage of the opportunity; and as the party got
out of the sleigh and made their way down the bank,
they saw that there was but one skater before them,
sweeping in vast solitary circles out in the middle
of the pond, under the cold moonlight. The party sat
on the bank in the shadow of some tall pine trees,
preparing for the amusement, piling spare coats and
shawls on the shoulders of a patient groom, and screwing
and buckling their skates on their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What beautiful ice!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, when
Vancouver had done his duty by the straps and fastenings.
She tapped the steel blade twice or thrice on the
hard black surface, still leaning on Vancouver&rsquo;s
arm, and then, without a word of warning, shot away
in a long sweeping roll. The glorious vitality in
her was all alive, and her blood thrilled and beat
wildly in utter enjoyment. She did not go far at first,
but seeing the others were long in their preparations,
she turned and faced them, skating away backwards,
leaning far over to right and left on each changing
stroke, and listening with intense pleasure to the
musical ring of the clanging steel on the clean ice.
Some pride she felt, too, at showing the little knot
of Bostonians how thoroughly at home she was in a
sport they seemed to consider essentially American.</p>

<p>Joe had not noticed the solitary skater, and thought
herself alone, but in a few moments she was aware
of a man in an overcoat bowing before her as he slackened
his speed. She turned quickly to one side and stopped
herself, for the man was John Harrington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, where did you come from, Mr. Harrington?&rdquo;
she asked in some astonishment. &ldquo;You were not
hidden under the seats of the sleigh, were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said John, looking about
for the rest of the party. &ldquo;I was belated in
Cambridge this afternoon, so I borrowed a pair of skates
and walked over. Splendid ice, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you came,&rdquo; said Joe. She
was in such high spirits and was so genuinely pleased
at meeting John that she forgot to be cold to him.
&ldquo;It would have been a dreadful pity to have
missed this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would indeed,&rdquo; said John, skating
slowly by her side.</p>

<p>For down by the pine trees two or three figures began
to move on the ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to thank you, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo;
said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for, Miss Thorn?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the pleasure you gave me the other night,&rdquo;
she answered. &ldquo;I have not seen you since to
speak to. It was splendid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I saw you
there, in the gallery on my left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but how could you have time to look about
and recognize people? You must have splendid eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all a habit,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;When
one has been before an audience a few times one does
not feel nervous, and so one has time to look about.
Do you care for that sort of thing, Miss Thorn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ever so much. But I was frightened once,
when they began to grumble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was nothing to fear,&rdquo; said John,
laughing. &ldquo;Audiences of that kind do not punctuate
one&rsquo;s speeches with cabbages and rotten eggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do sometimes in England,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;But here come the others!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two and two, in a certain grace of order, the little
party came out from the shore into the moonlight.
The women&rsquo;s faces looked white and waxen against
their rich furs, and the moonbeams sparkled on their
ornaments. A very pretty sight is a moonlight skating
party, and Pocock Vancouver knew what he was saying
when be hinted at the mysterious and romantic influences
that are likely to be abroad on such occasions. Indeed,
it was not long before young Hannibal was sliding
away hand in hand with Miss St. Joseph at a pace that
did not invite competition. And Mr. Topeka decided
which of the Aitchison girls he preferred, and gave
her his arm, so that the other fell to the lot of
Sam Wyndham, while Mrs. Sam and Sybil Brandon came
out escorted by Vancouver, who noticed with some dismay
that the party was &ldquo;a man short.&rdquo; The
moment he saw Joe talking to the solitary skater,
he knew that the latter must be Harrington, who had
gone to Cambridge and come across. John bowed to every
one and shook hands with Mrs. Wyndham. Joe eluded
Vancouver and put her arm through Sybil&rsquo;s, as
though to take possession of her.</p>

<p>Joe would have been well enough pleased at first to
have been left with John, but the sight of Vancouver
somehow reminded her of the compact she had made in
the morning with Sybil, and in a few moments the two
girls were away together, talking so persistently
to each other that Vancouver, who at first followed
them and tried to join their conversation, was fain
to understand that he was not wanted, so that he returned
to Mrs. Wyndham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want so much to talk to you,&rdquo; Joe began,
when they were alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear?&rdquo; said Sybil half interrogatively,
as they moved along. &ldquo;We can talk here charmingly,
unless Mr. Vancouver comes after us again. But you
do skate beautifully, you know. I had no idea you could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I told you I could do everything,&rdquo;
said Joe, with some pride. &ldquo;Where <i>did</i>
you get that beautiful fur, my dear? It is magnificent.
You are just like the Snow Angel now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Russia. Everybody wears white fur there,
you know. We were in St. Petersburg some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. We cannot get it in England. If one
could I would have told Ronald to bring me some when
he comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Ronald?&rdquo; asked Sybil innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is the dearest boy,&rdquo; said Joe,
with a little sigh, &ldquo;but I do so wish he were
not coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he has not got the white fur?&rdquo;
suggested Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! But because&rdquo;&ndash;Joe lowered her
voice and spoke demurely, at the same time linking
her arm more closely in Sybil&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You see,
dear, he wants to marry me, and I am afraid he is
coming to say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you do not want to marry him? Is that it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s small mouth closed tightly, and she merely
nodded her head gravely, looking straight before her.
Sybil pressed her arm sympathetically and was silent,
expecting more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was such a long time ago, you see,&rdquo;
said Joe, after a while. &ldquo;I was not out when
it was arranged, and it seemed so natural. But now&ndash;it
is quite different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of course, if you do not love him, you
must not think of marrying him,&rdquo; said Sybil,
simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Joe, with sudden
emphasis. &ldquo;But I shall have to tell him, you
know,&rdquo; she added despondently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very hard to say those things,&rdquo;
said Sybil, in a tone of reflection. &ldquo;But of
course it must be done&ndash;if you were really engaged,
that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, almost really,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite?&rdquo; suggested Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not quite; but I know he thinks it
is quite quite, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but perhaps he is not so certain, after
all. Do you know, I do not think men really care so
much; do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course not,&rdquo; said Joe scornfully.
&ldquo;But it does not seem quite honest to let a
man think you are going to marry him if you do not
mean to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did mean to, dear, until you found
out you did not care for him enough. And just think
how dreadful it would be to be married if you did
not care enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;It
would be dreadful for him too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is he coming?&rdquo; asked Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think next week. He sailed the day before
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is plenty of time to settle on what
you want to say,&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;If you
make up your mind just how to put it, you know, it
will be ever so much easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;I will trust
to luck. I always do; it is much easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Miss Brandon,&rdquo; said the voice
of Vancouver, who came up behind them at a great pace,
and holding his feet together let himself slide rapidly
along beside the two girls,&ndash;&ldquo;excuse me, but
do you not think you are very unsociable, going off
in this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I give you my arm, Miss Thorn?&rdquo; asked
Harrington, coming up on the other side.</p>

<p>Without leaving each other Joe and Sybil took the
proffered arms of the two men, and the four skated
smoothly out into the middle of the ice, that rang
again in the frosty air under their joint weight. Mrs.
Wyndham had insisted that Vancouver and Harrington
should leave her and follow the young girls, and they
had obeyed in mutual understanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which do you like better, Miss Brandon, boating
in Newport or skating on Jamaica Pond?&rdquo; asked
Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is better than the Music Hall, is it not?&rdquo;
remarked John to Miss Thorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jamaica Pond, by far,&rdquo; Sybil answered,
and her hold on Joe&rsquo;s arm relaxed a very little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! I would a thousand times rather be in
the Music Hall!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, and her hand
slipped away from Sybil&rsquo;s white fur. And so the
four were separated into couples, and went their ways
swiftly under the  glorious moonlight. As they parted
Sybil turned her head and looked after Joe, but Joe
did not see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather be here,&rdquo; said John quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is enough fighting in life to make peace
a very desirable thing sometimes,&rdquo; John answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man cannot be always swinging his battle-axe.&rdquo;
There was a very slight shade of despondency in the
tone of his voice. Joe noticed it at once.</p>

<p>Women do not all worship success, however much they
may wish their champion to win when they are watching
him fight. In the brilliant, unfailing, all-conquering
man, the woman who loves him feels pride; if she be
vain and ambitious, she feels wholly satisfied, for
the time. But woman&rsquo;s best part is her gentle
sympathy, and where there is no room at all for that,
there is very often little room for love. In the changing
hopes and fears of uncertain struggles, a woman&rsquo;s
love well given and truly kept may turn the scale
for a man, and it is at such times, perhaps, that
her heart is given best, and most loyally held by him
who has it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could do anything to help him to succeed,&rdquo;
thought Joe, in the innocent generosity of her half-conscious
devotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anything gone wrong?&rdquo; she asked aloud.</p>

<h1>Chapter VII.</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Has anything gone wrong?&rdquo;  There was
so much of interest and sympathy in her tone, as Joe
put the simple question, that John turned and looked
into her face. The magic of moonlight softens the
hardest features, makes interest look like friendship,
and friendship like love; but it can harden too at
times, and make a human face look like carved stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there is nothing wrong,&rdquo; John answered
presently; &ldquo;what made you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke a little regretfully,&rdquo; answered
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I? I did not mean to. Perhaps one is less
gay and less hopeful at some times than at others.
It has nothing to do with success or failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;One can
be dreadfully depressed when one is enjoying one&rsquo;s
self to any extent. But I should not have thought you
were that sort of person. You seem always the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I try to be. That is the great difference between
people who live to work and people who live to amuse
and be amused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;that people
who work, especially people who have to do with large
ideas and great movements, need to be more or less
monotonous. The men who succeed are the men of one
idea or at least they are the men who only have one
idea at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereas people who live to amuse and be amused
must have as many ideas as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to play with,&rdquo; said John, completing
the sentence. &ldquo;Their life is play, their ideas
are their playthings, and so soon as they have spoiled
one toy they must have another. The people who supply
ideas to an idle public are very valuable, and may
have great power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Novel-writers, and that sort of people,&rdquo;
suggested Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All producers of light literature and second-rate
poetry, and a very great variety of other people besides.
A man who amuses others may often be a worker himself.
He raises a laugh or excites a momentary interest by
getting rid of his superfluous ideas and imaginations,
reserving to himself all the time the one idea in
which he believes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all a bad theory,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are more men of that sort with you in
Europe than with us. You need more amusement, and
you will generally give more for it. You English, who
are uncommonly fond of doing nothing, give yourselves
vast trouble in the pursuit of pleasure. We Americans,
who are ill when we are idle, are content to surround
ourselves with the paraphernalia of pleasure when
office hours are over; but we make very little use
of our opportunities for amusement, being tired out
at the end of the day with other things which we think
more important. The result is that we have no such
thing as what you denominate &lsquo;Society,&rsquo;
because we lack the prime element of aristocratic
social intercourse, the ingrained determination to
be idle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very hard on us,&rdquo; remarked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; returned John, &ldquo;you
are compensated by having what we have not. Europeans
are the most agreeable people in the world, wherever
mutual and daily conversation and intercourse are
to be considered. The majority of you, of polite European
society, are not troubled with any very large ideas,
but you have an immense number of very charming and
attractive small ones. In America there are only two
ideas that practically affect society, but they are
very big ones indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Joe laconically, growing
interested in John&rsquo;s queer lecture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money and political influence,&rdquo; answered
John Harrington. &ldquo;They are the two great motors
of our machine. All men who are respected among us
are in pursuit of one or the other, or have attained
to one or the other by their own efforts. The result
is, that European society is amusing and agreeable;
whereas Americans of the same class are more interesting,
less polished, better acquainted with the general
laws that govern the development of nations.&rdquo;
 &ldquo;Really, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;you
are making us out to be very insignificant. And I
think it would be very dull if we all had to understand
ever so many general laws. Besides, I do not agree
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what, Miss Thorn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About Americans. They talk better than Englishmen,
as a rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am comparing Americans with the whole
mass of Europeans,&rdquo; John objected. &ldquo;The
English are a rather silent race, I should say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cold, you think?&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not cold. Perhaps less cold than we are;
but less demonstrative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;I
like people to feel more than they show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked John. &ldquo;Why should not
people be perfectly natural, and show when they feel
anything, or be cold when they do not?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I
think when you know some one feels a great deal and
hides it, that gives one the idea of reserved strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached a distant part of the ice, and were
slowly skating round the limits of a little bay, where
the slanting moonbeams fell through tall old trees
upon the glinting black surface. They were quite alone,
only in the distance they could hear the long-drawn
clang and ring of the other skaters, echoing all along
the lake with a tremulous musical sound in the still
bright night.  &ldquo;You must be very cold yourself,
Mr. Harrington,&rdquo; Joe began again after a pause,
stopping and looking at him.</p>

<p>John laughed a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No, indeed, I am
the most enthusiastic man alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are when you are speaking in public,&rdquo;
said Joe. &ldquo;But that may be all comedy, you know.
Orators always study their speeches, with all the
gestures and that, before a glass, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Of
course I know by heart what I am going to say, when
I make a speech like that of the other evening, but
I often insert a great deal on the spur of the moment.
It is not comedy. I grow very much excited when I
am speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never at any other time?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seldom; why should I? I do not feel other things
or situations so strongly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; replied Joe, &ldquo;it
is just as I said; you are generally very cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; John acquiesced, &ldquo;since
you will not allow the occasions when I am not cold
to be counted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe looked down as she stood, and moved her skates
slowly on the ice; the shadows hid her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;you
lose a great deal; you must, you cannot help it. You
only like people in a body, so as to see what you can
do with them. You only care for things on a tremendously
big scale, so that you may try to influence them.
When you have not a crowd to talk to, or a huge scheme
to argue about, you are bored to extinction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;I am not bored
at present, by any means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you are talking about big things. Most
men in your place would be talking about the moonlight,
and quoting Shelley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To oblige you, Miss Thorn, I could quote a
little now and then,&rdquo; said John, laughing. &ldquo;Would
it please you? I dare say you have seen elephants
stand upon their hind legs and their heads alternately.
I should feel very much like one; but I will do anything
to oblige you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is frivolous,&rdquo; said Joe, who did
not smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is. I am heavy by nature. You
may teach me all sorts of tricks, but they will not
be at all pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you are very interesting as you are,&rdquo;
said Joe quietly. &ldquo;But I do not think you will
be happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a question of happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Usefulness,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not care to be happy, you only care
to be useful?&rdquo; Joe asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But my ideas of usefulness include many
things. Some of the people who listen to me would
be very much astonished if they knew what I dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing would astonish me,&rdquo; said Joe,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Of course you must think of everything
in a large way&ndash;it is your nature. You will be a great
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John looked at his companion. She had struck the main
chord of his nature in her words, and he felt suddenly
that thrill of pleasure which comes from the flattery
of our pride and our hopes. John was not a vain man,
but he was capable of being intoxicated by the grandeur
of a scheme when the possibility of its realization
was suddenly thrust before him. Like all men of exceptional
gifts who are constantly before the public, he could
estimate very justly the extent of the results he could
produce on any given occasion, but his enthusiastic
belief in his ideas could see no limit to the multiplication
of those results. His strong will and natural modesty
about himself constantly repressed any desire he might
have to speak over-confidently of ultimate success,
so that the prediction of ultimate success by some
one else was doubly sweet to him. We Americans have
said of ourselves that we are the only nation who accomplish
what we have boasted of. Rash speech and rash action
are our national characteristics, and lead us into
all manner of trouble, but in so far as such qualifications
or defects imply a positive conviction of success,
they contribute largely to the realization of great
schemes. No one can succeed who does not believe in
himself, nor can any scheme be realized which has
not gained the support of a sufficient number of men
who believe in it and in themselves.</p>

<p>John was gratified by Miss Thorn&rsquo;s speech, for
he saw that it was spontaneous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to be great,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
the sake of what I think is great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a short pause, and the pair by common consent
skated slowly out of the shadow into the broad moonlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I believe you will be happy if you
think of nothing else,&rdquo; said Joe presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order to do anything well, one must think
of nothing else,&rdquo; answered John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many great men find time to be great and to
do many other things,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Look
at Mr. Gladstone; he has an immense private correspondence
about things that interest him, quite apart from the
big things he is always doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a man has reached that point he may find
plenty of time to spare,&rdquo; answered Harrington.
&ldquo;But until he has accomplished the main object
of his life he must not let anything take him from
his pursuit. He must form no ties, he must have no
interests, that do not conduce to his success. I think
a man who enters on a political career must devote
himself to it as exclusively as a missionary Jesuit
attacks the conversion of unbelievers, as wholly as
a Buddhist ascetic gives himself to the work of uniting
his individual intelligence with the immortal spirit
that gives it life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not agree with you,&rdquo; said Joe decisively,
and in her womanly intelligence of life she understood
the mistake John made. &ldquo;I cannot agree with
you. You are mixing up political activity, which deals
with the government of men, with spiritual ideas and
immortality, and that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked John, in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;that
to govern man a man must be human, and the imaginary
politician you tell me of is not human at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet I aspire to be that imaginary politician,&rdquo;
said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not think me too dreadfully conceited,&rdquo;
Joe answered, &ldquo;in talking about such things.
Of course I do not pretend to understand them, but
I am quite sure people must be like other people&ndash;I
mean in good ways&ndash;or other people will not believe
in them, you know. You are not vexed, are you?&rdquo;
She looked up into John&rsquo;s face with a little
timid smile that might have done wonders to persuade
a less prejudiced person than Harrington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No indeed! why should I be vexed? But perhaps
some day you will believe that I am right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, never!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, in a tone
of profound conviction. &ldquo;You will never persuade
me that people are meant to shut themselves from their
fellow-creatures, and not be human, and that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you were so good as to say that you
thought I might attain greatness,&rdquo; said John,
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you will. But you will change
your mind about a great many things before you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John&rsquo;s strong face grew thoughtful, and the
white moonlight made his features seem harder and
sterner than ever. Slowly the pair glided over the
polished black ice, now marked here and there with
clean white curves from the skates, and in a few minutes
they were once more within hail of the remainder of
their party.</p>

<h1>Chapter VIII.</h1>

<p>Eight days after the skating party, Ronald Surbiton
telegraphed from New York that he would reach Boston
the next morning, and Josephine Thorn knew that the
hour had come. She was not afraid of the scene that
must take place, but she wished with all her heart
that it were over.</p>

<p>As Sybil Brandon had told her, there had been time
to think of what she should say, and although she
had answered recklessly that she would &ldquo;trust
to luck,&rdquo; she knew when the day was come that
she had in reality thought intensely of the very words
which must be spoken. To Miss Schenectady she had
said nothing, but on the other hand she had become
very intimate with Sybil, and to tell the truth, she
hoped inwardly for the support and sympathy of her
beautiful friend.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, since her long evening with John Harrington
on the ice, she had made every effort to avoid his
society. Like many very young women with a vivid love
of enjoyment and a fairly wide experience, she was
something of a fatalist. That is to say, she believed
that her evil destiny might spring upon her unawares
at any moment, and she felt something when she was
with Harrington that warned her. For the first time
in her life she knew what it was to have moods of
melancholy; she caught herself asking what was really
the end and object of her gay life, whether it amounted
to anything worthy in comparison with the trouble
one had to take to amuse one&rsquo;s self, whether
it would not be far better in the end to live like
Miss Schenectady, reading and studying and caring nothing
for the world.</p>

<p>Not that Josephine admired Miss Schenectady, or thought
that she herself could ever be like her. The old lady
was a type of her class; intelligent and well versed
in many subjects&ndash;even learned she might have been
called by some. But to Joe&rsquo;s view, essentially
European by nature and education, it seemed as though
her aunt, like many Bostonians, judged everything&ndash;literature, music, art of all kinds, history and the
doings of great men&ndash; by one invariable standard.
Her comments on what she heard and read were uniformly
delivered from the same point of view, in the same
tone of practical judgment, and with the same assumption
of original superiority. It was the everlasting &ldquo;Carthago
delenda&rdquo; of the Roman orator. Whatever the world
wrote, sang, painted, thought, or did, the conviction
remained unshaken in Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s mind
that Beacon Street was better than those things, and
that of all speeches and languages known and spoken
in the world&rsquo;s history, the familiar dialect
of Boston was the one best calculated by Providence
and nature to express and formulate all manner of
wisdom.</p>

<p>It is a strange thing that where criticism is on the
whole so fair, and cultivation of the best faculties
so general, the manner of expressing a judgment and
of exhibiting acquired knowledge should be such as
to jar unpleasantly on the sensibilities of Europeans.
Where is the real difference? It probably lies in
some subtle point of proportion in the psychic chemistry
of the Boston mind, but the analyst who shall express
the formula is not yet born; though there be those
who can cast the spectrum of Boston existence and
thought upon their printed screens with matchless
accuracy.</p>

<p>Joe judged but did not analyze. She said Miss Schenectady
was always right, but that the way she was right was
&ldquo;horrid.&rdquo; Consequently she did not look
to her aunt for sympathy or assistance, and though
they had more than once talked of Ronald Surbiton
since receiving his cable from England, Joe had not
said anything of her intentions regarding him. When
the second telegram arrived from New York, saying that
he would be in Boston on the following morning, Joe
begged that Miss Schenectady would be at home to receive
him when he came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you insist upon it, I expect I shall
have to,&rdquo; said Miss Schenectady. She did not
see why her niece should require her presence at the
interview; young men may call on young ladies in Boston
without encountering the inevitable chaperon, or being
obliged to do their talking in the hearing of a police
of papas, mammas, and aunts. But as Joe &ldquo;insisted
upon it,&rdquo; as the old lady said, she &ldquo;expected
there were no two ways about it.&rdquo; Her expectations
were correct, for Joe would have refused absolutely
to receive Ronald alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the value of a stern aunt, my dear,&rdquo;
she had said to Sybil the day previous. When matters
were arranged, therefore, they went to bed, and in
the morning Miss Schenectady sat in state in the front
drawing-room, reading the life of Mr. Ticknor until
Ronald should arrive. Joe was up-stairs writing a
note to Sybil Brandon, wherein the latter was asked
to lunch and to drive in the afternoon. Ronald could
not come before ten o&rsquo;clock with any kind of
propriety, and they could have luncheon early and
then go out; after which the bitterness of death would
be past.</p>

<p>It was not quite ten o&rsquo;clock when Ronald Surbiton
rang the bell, and was turned into the drawing-room
to face an American aunt for the first time in his
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Schenectady?&rdquo; said he, taking the
proffered hand of the old lady and then bowing slightly.
He pronounced her name Schenectady, with a strong
accent on the penultimate syllable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sche<i>nec</i>tady,&rdquo; corrected his
hostess. &ldquo;I expect you are Mr. Surbiton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A&ndash;exactly so,&rdquo; said Ronald, in some
embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we are glad to see you in Boston, Mr.
Surbiton.&rdquo; Miss Schenectady resumed her seat,
and Ronald sat down beside her, holding his hat in
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your hat down,&rdquo; said the old lady.
&ldquo;What sort of a journey did you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very fair, thanks,&rdquo; said Ronald, depositing
his hat on the floor beside him, &ldquo;in fact I
believe we came over uncommonly quick for the time
of year. How is&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What steamer did you come by?&rdquo; interrupted
Miss Schenectady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Gallia. She is one of the Cunarders. But
as I was going to ask&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, an old boat, I expect. So you came on
right away from New York without stopping?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; answered Ronald. &ldquo;I took
the first train. The fact is, I was so anxious&ndash;so
very anxious to&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What hotel are you at here?&rdquo; inquired
Miss Schenectady, without letting him finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brunswick. How is Miss Thorn?&rdquo; Ronald
succeeded at last in putting the question he so greatly
longed to ask&ndash;the only one, he supposed, which would
cause a message to be sent to Joe announcing his arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe? She is pretty well. I expect she will
be down in a minute. Are you going to stay some while,
Mr. Surbiton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald thought Miss Schenectady the most pitiless
old woman he had ever met. In reality she had not
the most remote intention of being anything but hospitable.
But her idea of hospitality at a first meeting seemed
to consist chiefly in exhibiting a great and inquisitive
interest in the individual she wished to welcome.
Besides, Joe would probably come down when she was
ready, and so it was necessary to talk in the mean
time. At last Ronald succeeded in asking another question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse the anxiety I show,&rdquo; he said simply,
&ldquo;but may I ask whether Miss Thorn is at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if you rang the bell I could send for
her,&rdquo; remarked the old lady in problematic answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly!&rdquo; exclaimed Ronald, springing
to his feet, and searching madly round the room for
the bell. Miss Schenectady watched him calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think if you went to the further side of
the fire-place you would find it&ndash;back of the screen,&rdquo;
she suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks; here it is,&rdquo; cried Ronald, discovering
the handle in the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have found it now,&rdquo; said Miss
Schenectady with much indifference. &ldquo;Perhaps
you find it cold here?&rdquo; she continued, observing
that Ronald lingered near the fire-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no, thanks, quite the contrary,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if it is you might&ndash;Sarah, I think
you could tell Miss Josephine that Mr. Surbiton is
in the parlor, could not you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if it is any inconvenience&rdquo;&ndash;Ronald
began, misunderstanding the form of address Miss Schenectady
used to her handmaiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Miss Schenectady, in some
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Ronald, looking rather
confused; &ldquo;I did not quite catch what you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence, and the old lady and the young
man looked at each other.</p>

<p>Ronald was a very handsome man, as Joe knew. He was
tall and straight and deep-chested. His complexion
was like a child&rsquo;s, and his fine moustache like
silk. His thick fair hair was parted accurately in
the middle, and his smooth, white forehead betrayed
no sign of care or thought. His eyes were blue and
very bright, and looked fearlessly at every one and
everything, and his hands were broad and clean-looking.
He was perfectly well dressed, but in a fashion far
less extreme than that affected by Mr. Topeka and
young John C. Hannibal. There was less collar and more
shoulder to him, and his legs were longer and straighter
than theirs. Nevertheless, had he stood beside John
Harrington, no one would have hesitated an instant
in deciding which was the stronger man. With all his
beauty and grace, Ronald Surbiton was but one of a
class of handsome and graceful men. John Harrington
bore on his square brow and in the singular compactness
of his active frame the peculiar sign-manual of an
especial purpose. He would have been an exception
in any class and in any age. It was no wonder Joe
had wished to compare the two.</p>

<p>In a few moments the door opened, and Joe entered
the drawing-room. She was pale, and her great brown
eyes had a serious expression in them that was unusual.
There was something prim in the close dark dress she
wore, and the military collar of most modern cut met
severely about her throat. If Ronald had expected
a very affectionate welcome he was destined to disappointment;
Joe had determined not to be affectionate until all
was over. To prepare him in some measure for what
was in store, she had planned that he should be left
alone for a time with Miss Schenectady, who, she thought,
would chill any suitor to the bone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Ronald,&rdquo; said Joe, holding out
her hand, &ldquo;I am so glad to see you.&rdquo; Her
voice was even and gentle, but there was no gladness
in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not half so glad as I am to see you,&rdquo;
said Ronald, holding her hand in his, his face beaming
with delight. &ldquo;It seems such an age since you
left!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only two months, though,&rdquo; said
Joe, with a faint smile. &ldquo;I ought to apologize,
but I suppose you have introduced yourself to Aunt
Zo&euml;.&rdquo; She could not call her Aunt Zoruiah, even
for the sake of frightening Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you think when you got my telegram?&rdquo;
asked the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was very foolish of you to run
away just when the hunting was so good,&rdquo; answered
Joe with decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are glad, are you not?&rdquo; he asked,
lowering his voice, and looking affectionately at
her. Miss Schenectady was again absorbed in the life
of Mr. Ticknor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe, gravely. &ldquo;It is
as well that you have come, because I have something
to say to you, and I should have had to write it. Let
us go out. Would you like to go for a walk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald was delighted to do anything that would give
him a chance of escaping from Aunt Zoruiah and being
alone with Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had best be back to lunch,&rdquo;
remarked Miss Schenectady as they left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Aunt Zo&euml;,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;Besides,
Sybil is coming, you know.&rdquo; So they sallied
forth.</p>

<p>It was a warm day; the snow had melted from the brick
pavement, and the great icicles on the gutters and
on the trees were running water in the mid-day sun.
Joe thought a scene would be better to get over in
the publicity of the street than in private. Ronald,
all unsuspecting of her intention, walked calmly by
her side, looking at her occasionally with a certain
pride, mixed with a good deal of sentimental benevolence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Joe began presently, &ldquo;when
your cable came I felt very guilty at having written
to you that you might come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Ronald, innocently. &ldquo;You
know I would come from the end of the world to see
you. I have, in fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Joe wearily, wishing
she knew exactly how to say what she was so thoroughly
determined should be said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Joe?&rdquo; asked Ronald,
suddenly. He smiled rather nervously, but his smooth
brow was a little contracted. He anticipated mischief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something the matter, Ronald,&rdquo;
she said at last, resolved to make short work of the
revelation of her feelings. &ldquo;There is something
very much the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Surbiton, beginning to be
alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Ronald dear, somehow I think you
have thought&ndash;honestly, I know you have thought for
a long time that you were to marry me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ronald with a forced laugh,
for he was frightened. &ldquo;I have always thought
so; I think so now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no use to think it, Ronald dear,&rdquo;
said Joe, turning very pale. &ldquo;I have thought
of it too&ndash;thought it all over. I cannot possibly marry
you, dear boy. Honestly, I cannot.&rdquo; Her voice
trembled violently. However firmly she had decided
within herself, it was a very bitter thing to say;
she was so fond of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Ronald hoarsely. But he
turned red instead of pale. It was rather disappointment
and anger that he felt at the first shock than sorrow
or deep pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not make me say it again,&rdquo; said Joe,
entreatingly. She was not used to entreating so much
as to commanding, and her voice quavered uncertainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said Ronald, speaking
loudly in his anger, and then dropping his voice as
he remembered the passers-by,&ndash;&ldquo;do you mean to
tell me, Joe, after all this, when I have come to
America just because you told me to, that you will
not marry me? I do not believe it. You are making fun
of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ronald,&rdquo; Joe answered sorrowfully,
but regaining her equanimity in the face of Surbiton&rsquo;s
wrath, &ldquo;I am in earnest. I am very, very fond
of you, but I do not love you at all, and I never
can marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald was red in the face, and he trod fast and angrily,
tapping the pavement with his stick. He was very angry,
but he said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is much better to be honest about it,&rdquo;
said Joe, still very pale; and when she had spoken,
her little mouth closed tightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Ronald, who was serious
by this time; &ldquo;it is much better to be honest,
now that you have brought me three thousand miles to
hear what you have to say&ndash;much better. By all means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, Ronald,&rdquo; Joe answered.
&ldquo;I really did not mean you to come, and I am
very sorry,&ndash;oh, more sorry than I can tell you,&ndash;but
I cannot do it, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t, of course you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Will you please tell me who he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&ndash;what?&rdquo; asked Joe, coldly. She was
offended at the tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fellow you have pitched upon in my place,&rdquo;
he said roughly.</p>

<p>Joe looked up into his face with an expression that
frightened him. Her dark eyes flashed with an honest
fire, He stared angrily at her as they walked slowly
along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made a mistake,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I
am not sorry. I am glad. I would be ashamed to marry
a man who could speak like that to any woman. I am
sorry for you, but I am glad for myself.&rdquo; She
looked straight into his eyes, until he turned away.
For some minutes they went on in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Joe,&rdquo; said Ronald
presently, in a subdued tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Ronald dear, I was angry,&rdquo;
Joe answered. But her eyes were full of tears, and
her lips quivered.</p>

<p>Again they went on in silence, but for a longer time
than before. Joe felt that the blow was struck, and
there was nothing to be done but to wait the result.
It had been much harder than she had expected, because
Ronald was so angry; she had expected he would be
pained. He, poor fellow, was really startled out of
all self-control. The idea that Joe could ever ultimately
hesitate about marrying him had never seemed to exist,
even among the remotest possibilities. But he was
a gentleman in his way, and so he begged her pardon,
and chewed the cud of his wrath in silence for some
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; he said at last, with something
of his usual calm, though he was still red, &ldquo;of
course you are really perfectly serious? I mean, you
have thought about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;I am quite sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps it is better we should go home,&rdquo;
he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Indeed,
it would be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to see you again, Joe,&rdquo;
he said in a somewhat broken fashion. &ldquo;I mean,
by and by, when I am not angry, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe smiled at the simple honesty of the proposition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ronald dear, whenever you like. You are
very good, Ronald,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not good at all,&rdquo; said Ronald
sharply, and they did not speak again until he left
her at Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s door. Then she gave
him her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be at home until three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he answered; so they parted.</p>

<p>Joe had accomplished her object, but she was very
far from happy. The consciousness of having done right
did not outweigh the pain she felt for Ronald, who
was, after all, her very dear friend. They had grown
up together from earliest childhood, and so it had
been settled; for Ronald was left an orphan when almost
a baby, and had been brought up with his cousin as
a matter of expediency. Therefore, as Joe said, it
had always seemed so very natural. They had plighted
vows when still in pinafores with a ring of grass,
and later they had spoken more serious things, which
it hurt Joe to remember, and now they were suffering
the consequence of it all, and the putting off childish
illusions was bitter.</p>

<p>It was not long before Sybil Brandon came in answer
to Joe&rsquo;s invitation. She knew what trouble her
friend was likely to be in, and was ready to do anything
in the world to make matters easier for her. Besides,
though Sybil was so white and fair, and seemingly
cold, she had a warm heart, and had conceived a very
real affection for the impulsive English girl. Miss
Schenectady had retired to put on another green ribbon,
leaving the life of Mr. Ticknor open on the table,
and the two girls met in the drawing-room. Joe was
still pale, and the tears seemed ready to start from
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Sybil&ndash;it is so good of you to come,&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>Sybil kissed her affectionately and put her arm round
her waist. They stood thus for a moment before the
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have seen him?&rdquo; Sybil asked presently.
Joe had let her head rest wearily against her friend&rsquo;s
shoulder, and nodded silently in answer. Sybil bent
down and kissed her soft hair, and whispered gently
in her ear,&ndash;&ldquo;Was it very hard, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&ndash;indeed it was!&rdquo; cried Joe, hiding
her face on Sybil&rsquo;s breast. Then, as though
ashamed of seeming weak, she stood up boldly, turning
slightly away as she spoke. &ldquo;It was dreadfully
hard,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;but it is all over,
and it is very much better&ndash;very, very much, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; said Sybil, looking thoughtfully
at the fire. &ldquo;And now we will go out into the
country and forget all about it&ndash;all about the disagreeable
part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Joe, who had recovered
her equanimity, &ldquo;Ronald may come too. You see
he is so used to me that after a while it will not
seem to make so very much difference after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, if he would,&rdquo; said Sybil,
&ldquo;it would be very nice. He will have to get
used to the idea, and if he does not begin at once,
perhaps he never may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be just the same as ever when he gets
over his wrath,&rdquo; answered Joe confidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he very angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dreadfully! I never saw him so angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better when men are angry than when they
are sorry,&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;Something like
this once happened to me, and he got over it very well.
I think it was much more my fault, too,&rdquo; she
added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am sure you never did anything bad in
your life,&rdquo; said Joe affectionately. &ldquo;Nothing
half so bad as this&ndash;my dear Snow Angel!&rdquo; And
so they kissed again and went to lunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you went to walk,&rdquo; remarked
Miss Schenectady, when they met at table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;we walked a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all Englishmen walk, of course,&rdquo;
continued her aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of them can,&rdquo; said Joe, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, it is a great deal the right thing
there. Perhaps you might pass me the pepper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before they had finished their meal the door opened,
and Ronald Surbiton entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;excuse me,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I did
not know&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad you have come, Ronald,&rdquo;
cried Joe, rising to greet him, and taking his hand.
&ldquo;Sybil, let me introduce Mr. Surbiton&ndash;Miss Brandon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil smiled and bent her head slightly. Ronald bowed
and sat down between Sybil and Miss Schenectady.</p>

<h1>Chapter IX.</h1>

<p>Josephine Thorn never read newspapers, partly because
she did not care for the style of literature known
as journalistic, and partly, too, because the papers
always came at such exceedingly inconvenient hours.
If she had possessed and practiced the estimable habit
of &ldquo;keeping up with the times,&rdquo; she would
have observed an article which appeared on the morning
after the skating party, and which dealt with the speech
John Harrington had made in the Music Hall two days
previous. Miss Schenectady had read it, but she did
not mention it to Joe, because she believed in John
Harrington, and wished Joe to do likewise, wherefore
she avoided the subject; for the article treated him
roughly. Nevertheless, some unknown person sent Joe
a copy of the paper through the post some days later,
with a bright red pencil mark at the place, and Joe,
seeing what the subject was, read it with avidity.
As she read, her cheek flushed, her small mouth closed
like a vise, and she stamped her little foot upon the
floor.</p>

<p>It was evident that the writer was greatly incensed
at the views expressed by John, and he wrote with
an ease and a virulence which proclaimed a practiced
hand. &ldquo;The spectacle of an accomplished Democrat,&rdquo;
said the paper, &ldquo;is always sufficiently unusual
to attract attention: but to find so rare a bird among
ourselves is indeed a novel delight. The orator who
alternately enthralled and insulted a considerable
audience at the Music Hall, two nights ago, laid a
decided claim both to accomplishment and to democracy.
He himself informed his hearers that he was a Democrat;
and, indeed, it was necessary that he should state
his position, for it would have been impossible to
decide from the tone and quality of his opinions whether
he were a socialist, a reformer, a conservative, or
an Irishman. Perchance he has discovered the talisman
by which it is possible for a man to be all four,
and yet to be a man, Furthermore, he claims to be an
orator. No one could listen to the manifold intonations
of his voice, or witness the declamatory evolutions
of his body, without feeling an inward conviction
that the gentleman on the platform intended to present
himself to us as an orator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lest we be accused of partiality and prejudice,
we will at once state that we believe it possible
for a man to be singular in his manner and quaint
in his mode of phrasing, and yet to utter an opinion
in some one direction which, if neither novel nor
interesting, nor even tenable, shall yet have the
one redeeming merit of representing a conceivable point
of view. But when a man begins by stating that he
belongs to the Democrats and then claims as his own
the views of his political opponents, winding up by
demanding the sympathy and support of a third party,
the obvious conclusion is that he is either a lunatic,
a charlatan, or both. A man cannot serve God and Mammon,
neither can any man serve both the Irish and Chinese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Harrington has made a great discovery.
He has discovered that we require a Civil Service.
This is apparently the ground on which he states himself
to be a Democrat. If we remember rightly, the Civil
Service Convention, which sat in discussion of the
subject in the summer of 1881, was presided over by
a prominent member of the Republican party. As some
time has elapsed since then, and the gentlemen connected
with the movement are as active and as much interested
in it as ever, our orator will pardon us for questioning
his right of discovery on the one hand, and his claim
to be considered a Democrat on the strength of it,
on the other. A Civil Service is doubtless a good
thing, even a very good thing, and in due time we
shall certainly have it; but that the Constitution
of the United States is on the verge of dissolution
at the hands of our corrupt public officers, that
our finance is only another name for imminent bankruptcy,
or that the new millennium of Washington morals will
be organized by Mr. John Harrington&ndash;these things
we deny <i>in toto</i>, from beginning to end.
So wide and deep is our skepticism, that we even doubt
whether &rsquo;war, famine, revolution, or all three
together&rsquo; would have instantly ensued if Mr.
John Harrington had not delivered his speech on Wednesday
evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In illustration&ndash;or rather, in the futile attempt
to illustrate&ndash;Mr. Harrington put forth a series of
similes that should make any dead orator turn in his
grave. The nation was successively held up to our admiration
in the guise of a sick man, a cripple, a banker, a
theatrical company, and a peddler of tape and buttons.
We were bankrupt, diseased; and our bones, like those
of the Psalmist, were all out of joint; and if our
hearts did not become like melting wax in the midst
of our bodies, it was not the fault of Mr. John Harrington,
but rather was it due to the hardening of those organs
against the voice of the charmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Navigation Act called down the choicest
of the orator&rsquo;s vessels of wrath. Fools had
made it, worse than fools submitted to it, and the
reason why the Salem docks were no longer crowded
with the shipping of the Peabody family was that there
were ferry-boats in Boston harbor, a train of reasoning
that must be clear to the mind of the merest schoolboy.
Mr. Harrington further stated that these same ferry-boats&ndash;not
to mention certain articles he terms &lsquo;mudscows,&rsquo;
with which we have no acquaintance&ndash; are built of
old timber, copper, and nails, obtained by breaking
tip the fleets of the Peabody family, which is manifestly
a fraud on the nation. As far as the ferry-boats are
concerned, we believe we are in a position to state
that they are not built of old material; as regards
the aforesaid &lsquo;mudscows&rsquo; we can give no
opinion, not having before heard of the article, which
we presume is not common in commerce, and may therefore
be regarded as an exception to the universal rule
that things in general should not be made of old timber,
copper, and rusty nails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not weary our readers with any further
attempt at unraveling the opinions, illustrations,
and rhetoric of Mr. John Harrington, Democrat and
orator. The possession of an abundant vocabulary without
any especial use for it in the shape of an idea will
not revolutionize modern government, whatever may
be the opinion of the individual so richly gifted;
nor will any accomplished Democrat find a true key
to success in following a course of politics which
consists in one half of the world trying to drive
paradoxes down the throat of the other half. It will
not do, and Mr. Harrington will find it out. He will
find out also that the differences which exist between
the Republican and the Democratic parties are far
deeper and wider than he suspects, and do not consist
in such things as the existence or non-existence of
a Civil Service, free trade, or mudscows; and when
these things are forever crushed out of his imagination
it will be time enough to give him a name, seeing he
is neither Republican nor Democrat, nor Tammany, nor
even a Stalwart, nor a three-hundred-and-sixer&ndash;seeing,
in fact, that he is not an astronomical point in any
political heaven with which the world is acquainted,
but only the most nebulous of nebulae which have yet
come within our observation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe read the article rapidly, and then read the last
paragraph again and threw the paper aside. She sat
by the fire after breakfast, and Miss Schenectady
had come into the room several times and had gone out
again, busied with much housekeeping. For Miss Schenectady
belonged to the elder school of Boston women, who
&ldquo;see to things&rdquo; themselves in the intervals
of literature, gossip, and transcendental philosophy.
But Joe sat still for nearly half an hour after she
had done reading and nursed her wrath, while she toasted
her little feet at the fire. At last she made up her
mind and rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to see Sybil, Aunt Zo&euml;,&rdquo; she
said, meeting the old lady at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if she is up at this time of day,&rdquo;
answered Miss Schenectady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I fancy so,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sam Wyndham&rsquo;s establishment was of the
modern kind, and nobody was expected to attend an
early breakfast of fish, beefsteaks, buckwheat cakes,
hot rolls, tea, coffee, and chocolate at eight o&rsquo;clock
in the morning. Visitors did as they pleased, and
so did Mrs. Sam, and they met at luncheon, a meal
which Sam Wyndham himself was of course unable to
attend. Joe knew this, and knew she was certain to
find Sybil alone. It was Sybil she wanted to see,
and not Mrs. Wyndham. But as she walked down Beacon
Street the aspect of affairs changed in her mind.</p>

<p>Joe had not exaggerated when she said to Vancouver
that she had a very good memory, and it would have
been better for him if he had remembered the fact.
Joe had not forgotten the conversation with him in
the evening after Harrington&rsquo;s speech, and in
reading the article that had been sent to her she
instantly recognized a phrase, word for word as Vancouver
had uttered it. In speaking to her he had said that
politics &ldquo;consisted in one half of the world
trying to drive paradoxes down the throat of the other
half.&rdquo; It was true that in the article John Harrington
was warned that he would discover the fallacy of this
proposition, but in Joe&rsquo;s judgment this did
not constitute an objection. Vancouver had written
the article, and none other; Vancouver, who professed
a boundless respect for John, and who constantly asserted
that he took no active part whatever in politics. It
was inconceivable that the coincidence of language
should be an accident. Vancouver had made the phrase
when making conversation, and had used it in his article;
Joe was absolutely certain of that, and being full
of her discovery and of wrath, she was determined
to consult with her dearest friend as to the best
way of revenging the offense on its author.</p>

<p>But as she walked down Beacon Street she reflected
on the situation. She was sure Sybil would not understand
why she cared so much, and Sybil would form hasty
ideas as to the interest Joe took in Harrington. That
would never do. It would be better to speak to Mrs.
Sam Wyndham, who was herself so fond of John that
she would seize with avidity on the information, from
whatever source it came. But then Mrs. Wyndham was
fond of Vancouver also. No, she was not. When Joe
thought of it she was sure that though Vancouver was
devoted to Mrs. Sam, Mrs. Sam did not care for him
excepting as an agreeable person of even temper, who
was useful in society. But for Harrington she had
a real friendship. If it came to the doing of a service,
Mrs. Wyndham would do it. Joe&rsquo;s perceptions were
wonderfully clear and just.</p>

<p>But when she reached the house she was still uncertain,
and she passed on, intending to turn back and go in
as soon as she had made up her mind. In spite of all
that she could argue to herself it seemed unsafe&ndash;unwise,
at least. Sybil might laugh at her, after all; Mrs.
Wyndham might possibly tell Vancouver instead of telling
John. It would be better to tell John herself; she
remembered having once spoken to him about Vancouver,
and she could easily remind him of the conversation.
She would probably see him that evening at a party
she was going to; and yet it was so hard to have to
keep it all to herself for so many hours, instead of
telling. Nevertheless she would go and see Sybil,
taking care, of course, to say nothing about the article.</p>

<p>At the time Joe was walking up and down Beacon Street
in the effort to come to a decision, John Harrington
found himself face to face with a very much more formidable
problem. He stood before the fire-place in his rooms
in Charles Street, with an extinguished cigar between
his teeth, his face paler than usual, and a look of
uncertainty on his features that was oddly out of
keeping with his usual mood. He wore an ancient shooting
coat, and his feet were trust into a pair of dingy
leather slippers; his hands were in his pockets, and
he was staring vacantly at the clock.</p>

<p>On the oak writing-table that filled the middle of
the room lay an open telegram. It was dated from Washington,
and conveyed the simple information that Senator Caleb
Jenkins had died at five o&rsquo;clock that morning.
It was signed by an abbreviation that meant nothing
except to John himself. The name of the senator was
itself fictitious, and stood for another which John
knew.</p>

<p>The table was covered with Government reports, for
when the message came John was busy studying a financial
point of importance to him. The telegram had lain
on the table for half an hour, and John still stood
before the fire-place, staring at the clock.</p>

<p>The senator had not been expected to live, in fact
it was remarkable that he should have lived so long.
But when a man has been preparing for a struggle during
many months, he is apt to feel that the actual moment
of the battle is indefinitely far off. But now the
senator was dead, and John meant to stand in his place.
The battle was begun.  No one who has not seen some
of the inside workings of political life can have any
idea of what a man feels who is about to stand as
a candidate in an election for the first time in his
life. For months, perhaps for years, he has been engaged
with political matters; his opinions have been formed
by himself or by others into a very definite shape;
it may be that, like Harrington, he has frequently
spoken to large audiences with more or less success;
he may have written pamphlets and volumes upon questions
of the day, and his writings may have roused the fiercest
criticism and the most loyal support. All this he
may have done, and done it well, but when the actual
moment arrives for him to stand upon his feet and address
his constituents, no longer for the purpose of making
them believe in his opinions, but in order to make
them believe in himself, he is more than mortal if
he does not feel something very unpleasantly resembling
fear.</p>

<p>It is one thing to express a truth, it is another
to set one&rsquo;s self upon a pedestal and declare
that one represents it, and is in one&rsquo;s own person
the living truth itself. John was too honest and true
a man not to feel a positive reluctance to singing
his own praises, and yet that is what most electioneering
consists in.</p>

<p>But to be elected a senator in Massachusetts is a
complicated affair. A man who intends to succeed in
such an enterprise must not let the grass grow under
his feet. In a few hours the whole machinery of election
must be at work, and before night he would have to
receive all sorts and conditions of men and electioneering
agents. The morning papers did not contain any notice
of the senator&rsquo;s death, as they had already gone
to press when the news reached them, if indeed it
was as yet public property. But other papers appeared
at mid-day, and by that time the circumstances would
undoubtedly be known. John struck a match and relit
his cigar. The moment of hesitation was over, the
last breathing-space before the fight, and all his
activity returned. Half an hour later he went out with
a number of written telegrams in his hand, and proceeded
to the central  telegraph office.</p>

<p>The case was urgent. In the first place the governor
of the state would, according to law and custom, immediately
appoint a senator <i>pro tempore</i> to act until
the legislature should elect the new senator in place
of the one deceased. Secondly, the legislature, which
meets once a year, was already in session, and the
election would therefore take place immediately, unless
some unusual delay were created, and this was improbable.</p>

<p>In spite of the article which had so outraged Josephine
Thorn&rsquo;s sense of justice, there were many who
believed in John Harrington as the prophet of the
new faith, as the senator of reform and the orator
of the future, and his friends were numerous and powerful,
both in the electing body and among the non-official
mass of prominent persons who make up the aggregate
of public opinion. It had long been known that John
Harrington would be brought forward at the next vacancy,
which, in the ordinary course of things, would have
occurred in about a year&rsquo;s time, at the expiration
of the senior senator&rsquo;s term of office, but
which had now been suddenly caused by the death of
his colleague. John was therefore aware that his success
must depend almost immediately upon the present existing
opinion of him that prevailed, and as he made his
way through the crowded streets to the telegraph office,
he realized that no effort of his own would be likely
to make a change in that opinion at such short notice.
At first it had seemed to him as though he were on
a sudden brought face to face with a body of men whom
he must persuade to elect him as their representative,
and in spite of his great familiarity with political
proceedings, the idea was extremely disagreeable to
him. But on more mature reflection it was clear to
him that he was in the hands of his friends, that he
had said his say and had done all he would now be
able to do in the way of public speaking or public
writing, and that his only possible sphere of present
action lay in exerting such personal influence as he
possessed.</p>

<p>John Harrington was ambitious, or, to speak more accurately,
he was wholly ruled by a dominant aspiration. He was
convinced by his own study and observation, as well
as by a considerable amount of personal experience,
that great reforms were becoming necessary in the government
of the country, and he was equally sure that a man
was needed who should be willing to make any sacrifice
for the sake of creating a party to inaugurate such
changes. In his opinion the surest step towards obtaining
influence in the affairs of the country was a seat
in the senate, and with an unhesitating belief in
the truth and honesty of the principles he desired
to make known, he devoted every energy he possessed
to the attainment of his object.</p>

<p>To him government seemed the most important function
of society, the largest, the broadest, and the noblest;
to help, if possible, to be a leader in the establishment
of what was good for the country, and to be the very
foremost in destroying that which was bad, were in
his view the best objects and aims for a strong man
to follow. And John Harrington knew himself to be
strong, and believed himself to be right, and thus
armed he was prepared for any struggle.</p>

<p>The quality of vanity exists in all men, not least
in those whose chief profession is modesty; and seeing
that it is a universal element, created and inherent
in every one, it is impossible to say it is bad in
itself. For it is impossible to conceive any human
creature without it. A recent philosopher of reputation
has taught that by vanity, by the desire to appear
attractive to the other sex, man has changed his own
person from the form of a beast to the image of God.
Vanity is a mighty power and incentive, as great as
hunger and thirst, and much more generally active
in the affairs of civilized humanity. And yet its very
name means hollowness. &ldquo;The hollowness of hollowness,
all things are hollowness,&rdquo; said the preacher,
and his translators have put the word vanity in his
mouth, because it means the same thing. But in itself,
being hollow, it is neither bad nor good; its badness
or goodness lies in those things whereof a man makes
choice to fill the void, the inexpressible and indefinable
craving within his soul; as also hunger is only bad
when it is satisfied by bad things, or not satisfied
at all, so that in the one case it leads to disease,
and in the other to the committing of crimes in the
desire for satisfaction. Many a poor fellow was hung
by the neck in old times for stealing a loaf to stop
his hunger, and many a man of wit goes to the mad-house
nowadays because the void of his vanity is unfilled.</p>

<p>But vanity is called by yet another name when its
disagreeable side is hidden, and when its emptiness
has come to crave for great things. It is pride, then
honorable pride, then ambition, and perhaps at the
last it is called heroic sacrifice. Vanity is an unsatisfied
desire, hollow in itself, but capable of holding both
bad and good. It is not identical with self-complacency,
nor yet with conceit.</p>

<p>Probably John Harrington had originally possessed
as much of this mysterious quality as most men who
are conscious of strength and talent. It had never
manifested itself in small things, and its very extent
had made many things seem small which were of the
highest importance to other men. He had worked as
a boy at all manner of studies like other boys, but
the idea of laboring in distasteful matters for the
sake of being first among his companions seemed utterly
absurd to him. From the time he had begun to think
for himself&ndash;and he was young when he reached that
stage&ndash; he had formed a rooted determination to be
first in his country, to be a great reformer or a
great patriot, and he cared to study nothing that was
not connected with this idea. When his name was first
heard in public life, it was as the author of a pamphlet
advocating certain sweeping measures of which no one
else had ventured to dream as yet. He would have smiled
now had he taken the trouble to read again some of
those earlier productions of his. It had seemed so
easy to move the world then, and it seemed so hard
now. But nevertheless he meant to move it, and as each
year brought him increased strength and wider experience,
it brought with it also the conviction of ultimate
success. He had long forgotten to hope for the sudden
and immediate power to stir the world, for he had discovered
that it was a labor of years, the work of a lifetime;
but if he had ever had any doubts as to the result
of that work, he had forgotten them also.</p>

<p>And now his strength, his aspirations, his vanity,
and his intellect were roused together to the highest
activity of which they were capable, the hour having
come for which he had longed through half his lifetime,
and though it was but the first trial, in which he
might fail, it had for him all the importance of the
supreme crisis of his existence.  No wonder that his
face was pale and his lips set as he walked back to
his lodgings from the telegraph office. As he walked
down the hill by the railings of the Common he came
upon Josephine Thorn, standing at the entrance of one
of the boarded walks, as though hesitating whether
to go in. He was close to her as he bowed, and something
in her face made him stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; he said. She
nodded gravely and hesitated. He was about to go on,
thinking she was in one of those moods which he called
capricious. But she stopped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harrington, I want to speak to you,&rdquo;
she said quickly, seeing that her opportunity was
on the point of slipping away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said John, smiling faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harrington&ndash;did you read that article about
you, the day after the skating party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;It was not complimentary,
if I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was vile,&rdquo; said Joe, the angry color
rising to her temples again. &ldquo;It was abominable.
It was written by Mr. Vancouver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John started slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you must be mistaken,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not mistaken. There were things in
it, word for word as he said them to me just after
the speech. I am perfectly sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John looked very gravely at Joe, as though to be sure
of her honesty. There was no mistaking the look in
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thorn,&rdquo; John said, &ldquo;Vancouver
may have said those very things to some one else,
who wrote them and printed them. But in any case, I
am exceedingly obliged to you for the information&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not angry?&rdquo; Joe began, already
repenting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;how could I be? It may be important. The
junior senator for Massachusetts died this morning,
and there may be an election at any moment. I have
not told any one else, but it will be known everywhere
in an hour&rsquo;s time. Good-by, and many thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be senator, of course?&rdquo; said
Joe, in great excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; John answered. &ldquo;Are
you going down the hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;thanks&ndash;I am going home,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Chapter X.</h1>

<p>Joe had been mistaken in thinking that Ronald would
be less well received than herself. There was of course
the usual amount of gossip concerning him, but as
he refrained from eccentricities of dress when asked
to dinner, and did not bet that he would ride his
horse into the smoking-room of the Somerset Club,
the gossip soon lost ground against the list of his
good qualities. Moreover, he was extremely good-looking,
and his manner was modesty itself. He admired everything
he saw, partly because it was new to him, and partly
because there was a good deal to admire.</p>

<p>For a day or two after the final scene with Joe he
had avoided seeing her. He had not been able to resist
the temptation to go back on the same day, and he
had spent some hours in considering that human affairs
are extremely mutable. But the scenes about him were
too new, and very many of the faces he saw were too
attractive, to allow of his brooding for long over
his misfortune. His first impulse had been to go away
again on the very evening of his arrival. He had gone
to see Joe, arriving during luncheon, in the expectation
of seeing her alone again. There would be a scene
of solemn farewell, in which he would bid her be happy
in her own way, in a tone of semi-paternal benevolence,
after which he would give her his blessing, and bid
farewell to the pomps and vanities of society. He
would naturally retire gloomily from the gay world,
and end his miserable existence in the approved Guy
Livingstone fashion of life, between cavendish tobacco,
deep drinking, and high play. Joe would then repent
of the ruin she had caused, and that would be a great
satisfaction. There was once a little boy in Boston
whose hands were very cold as he went to school. But
he blew on them savagely, saying, &ldquo;I am glad
of it! It serves my father right for not buying me
my gloves.&rdquo; That was Ronald&rsquo;s state of
mind. He had led the most sober of lives, and the wildest
dissipation he remembered was the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
supper to the Oxford and Cambridge crews, when he
himself had been one of the winners. But surely, for
a disappointed lover there could be no course so proper
as a speedy death by dissipation&ndash;which would serve
Joe right. Therefore, on his return to his hotel,
he ordered whiskey, in a sepulchral tone of voice.
He tasted it, and thought it detestable.</p>

<p>On reflection, he would put off the commencement of
his wild career until the evening after he had seen
Joe again. The ravages of drink would not be perceptible
so soon, after all. He changed his tie for one of a
darker hue, ate sparingly of a beefsteak, and went
back to bid Joe a last farewell.</p>

<p>Sybil Brandon and Miss Schenectady were elements in
the solemn leave-taking which Ronald had not anticipated.
Sybil, moreover, made a great effort, for she was
anxious to help Joe as much as possible in her difficulties.
She talked to Ronald with a vivacity that was unusual,
and Joe herself was astonished at the brilliance of
her conversation. She had always thought Sybil very
reserved, if not somewhat shy.</p>

<p>Perhaps Sybil pitied Ronald a little. He was very
quiet in his manner, though after the first few minutes
he found himself talking much as usual. True, he often
looked at Joe, and then was silent; but then again
he looked at Sybil, and his tongue was unloosed. He
was grateful after a time, and he was also flattered.
Besides, he could not help noticing that his new acquaintance
was extremely beautiful. His conscience smote him as
he realized that he was thinking of her appearance,
and he immediately quieted the qualm by saying that
it was but natural admiration for an artistic object.
Ronald did not know much about artists and that sort
of people, but the expression formed itself conveniently
in his mind.</p>

<p>The consequence was that he accepted an invitation
to drive with the two girls after luncheon, and when
they left him at his hotel, a proceeding against which
he vehemently protested on the score of propriety,
he reluctantly acknowledged to himself that he had
enjoyed the afternoon very much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and see us after five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
said Sybil. &ldquo;I will present you to Mrs. Wyndham.
Nine hundred and thirty-six, Beacon Street,&rdquo;
she added, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With great pleasure&ndash;thanks,&rdquo; said Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Ronald dear,&rdquo; said Joe pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he answered in a doubtful tone
of voice, as he raised his hat; and the two girls
drove away.</p>

<p>Sybil was apparently in very good spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be frightened, Joe dearest,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;We will manage it very well. He is not
hurt in the least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I do not believe he is&ndash;so very much,
you know,&rdquo; Joe answered. But she was thoughtful,
and did not speak again for some time.</p>

<p>It was on the morning after this that Joe read the
article on John&rsquo;s speech, and met him by the
Common. Ronald did not call during the day, and in
the evening Joe went to her party as she had intended;
but neither Sybil nor John Harrington were there.
Sybil did not go to parties, and John probably had
too much to do. But at supper Joe chanced to be standing
near Mrs. Sam Wyndham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I so much wanted to see you, Miss Thorn,&rdquo;
said the latter. &ldquo;I wanted to tell you how much
we like your cousin, Mr. Surbiton. He came today, and
I have asked him to dinner to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Joe, turning a shade paler.
&ldquo;I am so glad you like him. He is a very nice
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is perfectly lovely,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sam,
enthusiastically. &ldquo;And he is so natural, you
would not know he was English at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Joe, raising her eyebrows
a little, but laughing at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham, &ldquo;I
always forget you are not one of us. Besides, you
are, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham rarely said a tactless thing, but this
evening she was in such good spirits that she said
what came uppermost in her thoughts. Joe was not offended;
she was only bored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not come and dine too, to-morrow night?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Wyndham, who was anxious to atone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, awfully,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;but
I have to dine with the Aitchisons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pocock Vancouver, pale and exquisite as ever, came
up to the two ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I get you anything, Mrs. Wyndham?&rdquo;
he inquired, after a double bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. Johnny Hannibal is taking care
of me,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Sam, coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thorn, what can I get you?&rdquo; he asked,
turning to Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, thanks,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;Mr.
Biggielow is getting me something.&rdquo; She did
not look at Vancouver as she answered, and the angry
color began to rise to her temples. Vancouver, who
was not used to repulses such as these, and was too
old a soldier to give up a situation so easily, stood
a moment playing with his coat tails. A sudden thought
passed through Joe&rsquo;s mind. It struck her that,
considering the situation of affairs, it would be
unwise to break off her acquaintance with Vancouver
at the present time. Her first honest impulse was
to cut him and never speak to him again. But it was
better to act with more deliberation. In the first
place, there might be more to be learnt which might
be of service to John; secondly, people would talk
about it if she cut him, and would invent some story
to the effect that he had proposed to marry her, or
that she had proposed to marry him. It was contrary
to her nature to pretend anything she did not feel,
but it would nevertheless be a mistake to quarrel openly
with Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On second thoughts&ndash;if you would get me a glass
of water&rdquo;&ndash;she said, speaking to him. He instantly
disappeared; but even in the moment before he departed
to execute her command he had time to express by his
look a sense of injury forgiven, which did not escape
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a hypocrite the man is!&rdquo; she thought.</p>

<p>Vancouver on his part could form no conception of
the cause of the coldness the two ladies had shown
him. He could not know that Joe had discovered in
him the writer of the article, still less could he
have guessed that Joe had told John, and that John
had told Mrs. Sam. He could only suppose that the
two had been talking of something, and were annoyed
at being interrupted.</p>

<p>When he came back with the glass of water Mr. Biggielow
had just brought Joe some salad. The usual struggle
began between the two men. Mr. Bonamy Biggielow was
a little poet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to thank you, Miss Thorn, instead of
you thanking me,&rdquo; said Vancouver, in a seductive
voice, on one side of Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not the most crowded supper you ever
saw?&rdquo; remarked Mr. Biggielow on the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Joe, eating her salad and
looking straight before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to send me away. I
was so glad when you condescended to make use of me,&rdquo;
answered Vancouver.</p>

<p>Mr. Biggielow also answered Joe&rsquo;s interrogation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I mean it is thronged
with people. There is a decided &rsquo;sound of revelry
by night&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Youth and beauty? That sort of thing?&rdquo;
said Joe to Biggielow. Then turning to Vancouver,
she added, &ldquo;Why should I send you away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope there is no reason,&rdquo; he said gravely.
&ldquo;In fact, I am sure there is none, except that
you would of course always do exactly as you pleased
about that and everything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Joe answered, and her lip
curled a little proudly, &ldquo;you are quite right
about that. But then, you know, I did not send you
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, again,&rdquo; said Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do let me get you something more, Miss Thorn,&rdquo;
suggested Mr. Biggielow. &ldquo;No? There is any amount
of <i>p&acirc;t&eacute;s</i>. You always like&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you have heard about Harrington?&rdquo;
said Vancouver in a low voice close to Josephine&rsquo;s
ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, really,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Will
you take my plate? And the glass&ndash; thanks.&rdquo;
Mr. Bonamy Biggielow was obliged to retire. &ldquo;You
mean about the senatorship?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The senator died this morning. Harrington
will make a fight for it. He has many friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among whom you count yourself, doubtless,&rdquo;
remarked Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not politically, of course. I take no active
part&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; Joe knew the remainder
of the sentence by heart. &ldquo;Then you will have
a glorious opportunity for maintaining an armed neutrality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if it comes to that,&rdquo; said Vancouver
mildly, &ldquo;I would rather see Harrington senator
than some of our own men. At all events, he is honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events!&rdquo; Joe repeated. &ldquo;You
think, perhaps, that some man of your own party may
be elected who will not turn out to be honest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the thing is possible. You see, politics
are such a dirty business &ndash;all kinds of men get in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe laughed in a way that made Vancouver nervous.
He was beginning to know her, and he could tell when
some sharp thrust was coming by the way she laughed.
Nevertheless, he was fascinated by her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not long since you told me that Mr. Harrington&rsquo;s
very mild remark about extinguishing bribery and corruption
was a piece of gross exaggeration,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;Why do you say politics are dirty work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a great difference,&rdquo; answered
Vancouver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What difference? Between what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between saying that the business of politics
is not clean, and saying that all public officers
are liars, like the Cretans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is exaggerating now?&rdquo; asked Joe scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is I,&rdquo; answered Vancouver,
submissively. &ldquo;If it is not a rude question,
did not that dress come from Egypt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The garment in question was made
of a kind of soft white, fluted material over a rose-colored
silk ground. The raised flutings followed the exquisite
lines of Joe&rsquo;s figure, and had the double merit
of accentuating its symmetry, and of so leading the
eye as to make her height seem greater than it really
was. Cut square at the neck, it showed her dazzling
throat at its best advantage, and a knot of pink lilies
at the waist harmonized delicately with the color
of the whole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just like you,&rdquo; said Vancouver,
&ldquo;to have something different from everybody
else. I admire Eastern things so much, and one gets
so tired of the everlasting round of French dresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you like it,&rdquo; said Joe, indifferently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so anxious to meet your cousin, Miss Thorn,&rdquo;
said Vancouver, trying a new subject. &ldquo;I hear
there is to be a dinner for him to-morrow night at
Mrs. Sam Wyndham&rsquo;s. But of course I am not asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why &rsquo;of course&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired
Joe quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe Mrs. Wyndham thinks I dislike Englishmen,&rdquo;
said Vancouver at random. &ldquo;But she is really
very much mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;I should be willing to like any number
of Englishmen for the sake of being liked by one Englishwoman.&rdquo;
He looked at Joe expressively as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes. Do you not believe me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Why should
I not believe you?&rdquo; Her voice was calm, but
that same angry flush that had of late so often shown
itself began to rise slowly at her temples. Vancouver
saw it, and thought she was blushing at what he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust you will,&rdquo; said Vancouver. &ldquo;I
trust that some day you will let me tell you who that
Englishwoman is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was horrible; he was making love to her, this wretch,
whom she despised. She turned her head away to hide
the angry look in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks&ndash;no, if you do not mind,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;I do not care to receive confidences,&ndash;I
always forget to forget them.&rdquo; It was not in
order that Pocock Vancouver might make love to her
that she had sent away Bonamy Biggielow, the harmless
little poet. She wished him back again, but he was
embarked in an enterprise to dispute with Johnny Hannibal
a place near Miss St. Joseph. Mrs. Wyndham had long
since disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please take me back to my aunt?&rdquo;
said Joe. As they passed from the supper-room they
suddenly came upon John Harrington, who was wandering
about in an unattached fashion, apparently looking
for some one. He bowed and stared a little at seeing
Joe on Vancouver&rsquo;s arm, but she gave him a look
of such earnest entreaty that he turned and followed
her at a distance to see what would happen. Seeing
her sit down by her aunt, he came up and spoke to
her, almost thrusting Vancouver aside with his broad
shoulders. Vancouver, however, did not dispute the
position, but turned on his heel and went away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad,&rdquo; said Joe, with a sigh
of relief. &ldquo;I thought I should never get away
from him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is amazing what a difference the common knowledge
of a secret will make in the intimacy of two people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was rather taken aback at seeing you with
him,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Not that it can make
any difference to you,&rdquo; he added quickly, &ldquo;only
you seemed so angry at him this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it does&rdquo;&ndash;Joe began, impulsively.
&ldquo;That is, I began by meaning to cut him, and
then I thought it would be a mistake to make a scandal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;it would be a
great mistake. Besides, I would not for all the world
have you take a part in this thing. It would do no
good, and it might do harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have taken a part already,&rdquo;
said Joe, somewhat hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. I am very grateful, but I hope
you will not think any more about it, nor allow it
to influence you in any way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is the use of friends if they do not
take a part in one&rsquo;s quarrels?&rdquo; asked
Joe.</p>

<p>John looked at her earnestly for a few seconds, and
saw that she was perfectly sincere. He had grown to
like Josephine of late, and he was grateful to her
for her friendship. Her manner that morning, when she
told him of her discovery, had made a deep impression
on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Thorn,&rdquo; he said earnestly,
in a low voice, &ldquo;you are too good and kind,
and I thank you very heartily for your friendship.
But I think you were very wise not to cut Vancouver,
and I hope you will not quarrel with anybody for any
matter so trivial.&rdquo; The color came to Joe&rsquo;s
face, but not for anger this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trivial!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, trivial,&rdquo; John repeated. &ldquo;Remember
that it is the policy of that paper to abuse me, and
that if Vancouver had not written the article, the
editor could have found some one else easily enough
who would have done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is such a dastardly thing!&rdquo; said
Joe. &ldquo;He always says to every one that he has
the greatest respect for you, and then he does a thing
like this. If I were you I would kill him&ndash;I am sure
I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would not be the way to win an election
nowadays,&rdquo; said John, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would not care about that,&rdquo; said
Joe, hotly. &ldquo;But I dare say it is very silly
of me,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;You do not seem to
mind it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not worth while to lose one&rsquo;s temper
or one&rsquo;s soul for the iniquities of Mr. Pocock
Vancouver,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;The man may do
me harm, but as I never expected his friendship or
help, he neither falls nor rises in my estimation
on that account. Blessed are they who expect nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed indeed,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;But
one cannot help expecting men who have the reputation
of being gentlemen to behave decently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vancouver has a right to his political opinions,
and a perfect right to express them in any way he
sees fit,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Joe, impatiently.
&ldquo;This is a free country, and that sort of thing.
But if he means to express political opinions he should
not cry aloud at every tea-party in town that he is
neutral and takes no active part in politics. I think
that writing violent articles in a newspaper is a
very active part indeed. And he should not go about
saying that he has the highest reverence for a man,
and then call him a lunatic and a charlatan in print,
unless he is willing to sign his name to it, and take
the consequences. Should he? I think it is vile, and
horrid, and abominable, and nasty, and I hate him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the exception of the peroration to that
speech,&rdquo; said John, who was very much amused,
&ldquo;I am afraid I must agree with you. A man certainly
ought not to do any of those things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you defend him?&rdquo; asked Joe,
with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, on general principles, I do not think
a man is so much worse than his fellows because he
does things they would very likely do in his place.
There are things done every day, all over the world,
quite as bad as that, and no one takes much notice
of them. Almost every businessman is trying to get
the better of some other business man by fair means
or foul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not seem to have a very exalted idea
of humanity,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A large part of humanity is sick,&rdquo; said
John, &ldquo;and it is as well to be prepared for
the worst in any illness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you were not so tremendously calm, you
know,&rdquo; said Joe, looking thoughtfully into John&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;I am afraid it will injure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why in the world should it injure me?&rdquo;
asked John, much astonished at the remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a presentiment&rdquo;&ndash;she checked herself
suddenly. &ldquo;I do not like to tell you,&rdquo;
she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to hear what you think, if you
will tell me,&rdquo; said John, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do not be angry. I have a presentiment
that you will not be made senator. Are you angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No indeed. But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just for that very reason; you are too calm.
You are not enough of a partisan. Every one is a partisan
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John was silent, and his face was grave and thoughtful.
The remark was profound in its way, and showed a far
deeper insight into political matters than he imagined
Joe possessed. He had long regarded Mrs. Wyndham as
a woman of fine sense and judgment, and had often asked
her opinion on important questions. But in all his
experience she had never said anything that seemed
to strike so deeply at the root of things as this simple
remark of Josephine&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are angry,&rdquo; said Joe,
seeing that he was grave and silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have set me thinking, Miss Thorn,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I may be right?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea is quite new to me, I think it is
perhaps the best definition of the fact that I ever
heard. But it is not what ought to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Joe answered. &ldquo;Nothing
is just what it ought to be. But one has to take things
as they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And make them what they should be,&rdquo; added
John, and the look of strong determination came into
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Joe, softly. &ldquo;Make
things what they should be. That is the best thing
a man can live for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we might go home, Joe,&rdquo; said
Miss Schenectady, who had been conversing for a couple
of hours with another old lady of literary tastes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Zo&euml;,&rdquo; said Joe, rousing herself,
&ldquo;I think we might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I see you to-morrow night at Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s
dinner?&rdquo; asked John, as they parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I refused. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Joe sat by her aunt&rsquo;s side in the deep dark
carriage on the way home, her hands were cold and
she trembled from head to foot. And when at last she
laid her head upon her pillow there were tears in her
eyes and on her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that I can be so heartless?&rdquo;
she murmured to herself.</p>

<h1>Chapter XI.</h1>

<p>Ronald went to see Sybil Brandon at five o&rsquo;clock,
and as it chanced he found her alone. Mrs. Wyndham,
she said, had gone out, or rather she had not yet
come home; but if Ronald would wait, she would certainly
be in.</p>

<p>Ronald waited, and talked to Miss Brandon in the mean
while. He had a bereaved air when he arrived, which
was calculated to excite sympathy, and his conversation
was subdued in tone, and grave in subject. But Sybil
did her best to cheer him, and in the fullness of
her sympathy did perhaps more than was absolutely
necessary. Ronald&rsquo;s wound was not deep, but he
had a firm conviction that it ought to be.</p>

<p>Any man would have thought the same in his place.
Certainly, few people would have understood what they
felt in such a position. He had grown up believing
he was to marry a young and charming woman of whom
he was really exceedingly fond, and now he was suddenly
told that the whole thing was a mistake. It was enough
to break a man&rsquo;s heart, and yet Ronald&rsquo;s
heart was not broken, and to his great surprise beat
nearly as regularly the day after his disaster as
it had done during the whole two-and-twenty years of
his life. He could not understand his own calmness,
and he was sure that he ought to be profoundly grieved
over the whole affair, so that his face was drawn
into an expression of solemnity somewhat out of keeping
with its singular youthful freshness of color and
outline.</p>

<p>The idea of devoting himself to the infernal gods
as a sacrifice to the blighted passion had passed
away in the course of the drive on the previous afternoon.
He had felt no inclination to drown his cares in drink
during the evening, but on the contrary he had gone
for a brisk walk in Beacon Street, and had ascertained
by actual observation, and the assistance of a box
of matches, the precise position of No. 936. This had
occupied some time, as it is a peculiarity of Boston
to put the number of the houses on the back instead
of the front, so that the only certain course to follow
in searching for a friend, is to reach the rear of
his house by a circuitous route through side streets
and back alleys, and then, having fixed the exact
position of his residence by astronomical observation,
to return to the front and inquire for him. It is true
that even then one is frequently mistaken, but there
is nothing else to be done.</p>

<p>It was perhaps not extraordinary that Ronald should
be at some pains to find out where Mrs. Wyndham lived,
for Sybil was the only person besides  Joe and Miss
Schenectady whom he had yet met, and he wanted company,
for he hated and dreaded solitude with his whole heart.
Having traveled all the night previous, he went home
and slept a sounder sleep than falls to the lot of
most jilted lovers.</p>

<p>The next day he rose early and &ldquo;did&rdquo; Boston.
It did not take him long, and he said to himself that
half of it was very jolly, and half of it was too
utterly beastly for anything. The Common, and the Gardens,
and Commonwealth Avenue, you know, were rather pretty,
and must have cost a deuce of a lot of money in this
country; but as for the State House, and Paul Revere&rsquo;s
Church, and the Old South, and the city generally,
why, it was simply disgusting, all that, you know.
And in the afternoon he went to see Sybil Brandon,
and began talking about what he had seen.</p>

<p>She was, if anything, more beautiful than ever, and
as she looked at him, and held out her hand with a
friendly greeting, Ronald felt himself actually blushing,
and Sybil saw it and blushed too, a very little. Then
they sat down by the window where there were plants,
and they looked out at the snow and the people passing.
Sybil asked Ronald what he had been doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been doing Boston,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of
course it was the proper thing. But I am afraid I
do not know much about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you like it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It
is much more important, I think, to know whether you
like things or dislike them, than to know everything
about them. Do not you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;But
I like Boston very much; I mean the part where you
live. All this, you know&ndash;Commonwealth Place, and the
Public Park, you know, and Beacon Avenue, of course,
very much. But the city &ldquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not like the city?&rdquo; suggested
Sybil, seeing he hesitated, and smiling at his strange
confusion of names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;I think it is
so cramped and ugly, and all little narrow streets.
But then, of course, it is such a little place. You
get into the country the moment you walk anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems very big to the Bostonians,&rdquo;
said Sybil, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. You have lived here all your
life, and so it is quite different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? Dear me no! I am not a Bostonian at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Ronald, &ldquo;I thought you
were. That was the reason I was not sure of abusing
the city to you. But it is not a bad place, I should
think, when you know lots of people, and that was
such a pretty drive we went yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it must seem very new to you. Everything
must, I should think, most of all this casual way
we have of receiving people. But there really is a
Mrs. Wyndham, with whom I am staying, and she will
be in before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;don&rsquo;t&ndash;don&rsquo;t mention her,&rdquo;
said Ronald, hastily, &ldquo;I mean it&ndash;it is of no
importance whatever, you know.&rdquo; He blushed violently.</p>

<p>Sybil laughed, and Ronald blushed again, but in all
his embarrassment lie could not help thinking what
a silvery ring there was in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid Mrs. Wyndham would not like it,
if she heard you telling me she was not to be mentioned,
and was not of any importance whatever. But she is
a very charming woman, and I am very fond of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is your aunt, I presume, Miss Brandon?&rdquo;
said Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My aunt?&rdquo; repeated Sybil. &ldquo;Oh no,
not at all&ndash;only a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought all unattached young ladies lived
with aunts here, like Miss Schenectady.&rdquo; Ronald
smiled grimly at the recollections of the previous
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; said Sybil, laughing.
&ldquo;Mrs. Wyndham is not the least like Miss Schenectady.
She is less clever and more human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I am so glad,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;And
she talks so oddly&ndash;Joe&rsquo;s&ndash;Miss Thorn&rsquo;s
aunt. Could you tell me, if it is not a rude question,
why so many people here are never certain of anything?
It strikes me as so absurdly ridiculous, you know.
She said yesterday that &rsquo;perhaps, if I rang the
bell, she could send a message.&rsquo; And the man
at the hotel this morning had no postage stamps, and
said that perhaps if I went to the General Post Office
I might be able to get some there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sybil, &ldquo;it is absurd,
and one catches it so easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would it not be ridiculous if the guard
called out at a station, &lsquo;Perhaps this is Boston!&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Perhaps this is New York?&rsquo; It would
be too utterly funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that if you begin to make a list
of our peculiarities yon will find funnier things
than that,&rdquo; said Sybil, laughing. &ldquo;But
then we always laugh at you in England, so that it
is quite fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are very absurd, I know,&rdquo; said
Ronald, &ldquo;but I think we are much more comfortable.
For instance, we do not have niggers about who call
us &lsquo;Mister.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not use such words in Boston, Mr.
Surbiton,&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;Seriously, there
are people who would be very much offended. You must
speak of &lsquo;waiters of color,&rsquo; or &lsquo;the
colored help;&rsquo; you must be very careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;Thanks.
Is everything rechristened in that way? I am afraid
I shall always be in hot water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, there are no men and women here. They
are all ladies and gentlemen, or &lsquo;the gurls,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;the fellows.&rsquo; But it is very soon
learnt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can imagine,&rdquo; said Ronald, very
much amused. &ldquo;But&ndash;by the bye, this is the season
here, is not it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they chattered together for nearly an hour about
the merest nothings, not saying anything particularly
witty, but never seeming to each other in the least
dull. Ronald had gone to Sybil for consolation, and
he was so well consoled that he was annoyed when Mrs.
Wyndham came in and interrupted his <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.
Sybil introduced Ronald, and when he rose to go, after
a quarter of an hour, Mrs. Wyndham asked him to dinner
on the following day.</p>

<p>That night, when Ronald was alone in his room at the
hotel, he took Josephine&rsquo;s photograph from a
case in his bag and set it before him on the table.
He would think about her for a while, and reflect on
his situation; and he sat down for that purpose, his
chin resting on his folded hands. Dear Joe&ndash;he loved
her so dearly, and she was so cruel not to marry him!
But, somehow, as he looked, he seemed to see through
the photograph, and another face came and smiled on
him. Again and again he called his attention back,
and tried to realize that the future would be very
blank and dreary without Joe; but do what he would,
it did not seem so blank and dreary after all; there
was somebody else there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe is quite right,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;I
am a brute.&rdquo; And he went to bed, trying hard
to be disgusted with himself. But his dreams were sweet,
for he dreamed he was sitting among the ferns at Mrs.
Wyndham&rsquo;s house, talking to Sybil Brandon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham, when
Ronald was gone, &ldquo;he is perfectly charming.
We have positively found a new man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;I am so glad
you asked him to dinner. I do not think he is very
clever, but he talks easily, and says funny things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he has come over to marry his cousin&ndash;has
not he?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Wyndham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Sybil, &ldquo;he is not
going to marry Joe Thorn,&rdquo; she answered absently;
for she was thinking of something, and her tone indicated
such absolute certainty in the matter that Mrs. Wyndham
looked quickly at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you seem quite certain about it, any
way,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? Oh&ndash;well, yes. I think it is extremely unlikely
that he will marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost wish I had offered to take him to
the party to-night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham, evidently
unsatisfied. &ldquo;However, as he is coming to-morrow,
that will do quite as well. Sybil, dear, you look
tired. Why don&rsquo;t you go and lie down before
dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, because&ndash;I am not tired, really. I am always
pale, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am tired to death myself, my dear,
and as there is no one here I will say I am not at
home, and rest till dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham had been as much startled as any one
by news of the senator&rsquo;s death that morning,
and though she always professed to agree with her
husband she was delighted at the prospect of John Harrington&rsquo;s
election. She had been a good friend to him, and he
to her, for years, and she cared much more for his
success than for the turn of events. She had met him
in the street that afternoon, and they had perambulated
the pavement of Beacon Street for more than an hour
in the discussion of the future. John had also told
her that he was now certain that Vancouver was the
writer of the offensive articles that had so long
puzzled him; at all events that the especial one which
had appeared the morning after the skating-party was
undoubtedly from his pen. Mrs. Wyndham, who had long
suspected as much, was very angry when she found that
her suspicions had been so just, and she proposed
to deal summarily with Vancouver. John, however, begged
her to temporize, and she promised to be prudent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she said to Sybil, as she
was about to leave the room, &ldquo;it was a special
providence that you did not marry Vancouver. He has
turned out badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil started slightly and looked up. Her experience
with Pocock Vancouver was a thing she rarely referred
to. She had undoubtedly given him great encouragement,
and had then mercilessly refused him, to the great
surprise of every one. But as that had occurred a
year and a half ago, it was quite natural that she
should treat him like any one else, now, just as though
nothing had happened. She looked up at Mrs. Wyndham
in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how he always talks about John Harrington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He always says he respects him immensely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. It is he who has been writing those
scurrilous articles that we have talked about so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How disgraceful!&rdquo; exclaimed Sybil. &ldquo;How
perfectly detestable! Are you quite sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not the least doubt about it. John
Harrington told me himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then of course it is true,&rdquo; said
Sybil. &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harrington takes it in the calmest way, as
though he had expected it all his life. He says they
were never friends, and that Vancouver has a perfect
right to his political opinions. I never saw anybody
so cool in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a splendid fellow he is!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sybil. &ldquo;There is something lion-like about
him. He would forgive an enemy a thousand times a day,
and say the man who injured him had a perfect right
to his opinions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why gracious goodness, Sybil, how you talk!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Wyndham; &ldquo;you are not in love with
the man yourself, are you, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; asked Sybil. Then she laughed. &ldquo;No,
indeed! I would not marry him if he asked me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would never marry a celebrity like that.
He is splendid, and noble, and honest; but everything
in him is devoted to his career. There is no room
for a woman at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the amount of solid knowledge about
men that you dear, sweet, lovely, beautiful, innocent
little girls possess is something just too perfectly
amazing!&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham, slowly, and with
great emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we do,&rdquo; said Sybil, &ldquo;it is not
surprising. I am sure I do not wonder at girls knowing
a great deal about the world. Everything is discussed
before them, and marriage and men are the usual topics
of conversation. The wonder is that girls still make
so many mistakes in their choice, after listening
to the combined experience of all the married women
of their acquaintance for several years. It shows
that no one is infallible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a funny girl you are, Sybil!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Wyndham. &ldquo;I think you turn the tables on
me altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes? Well, I have experiences of my own now,&rdquo;
said Sybil, leaning back against an enormous cushion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham came and sat upon the arm of the easy-chair,
and put one arm round Sybil&rsquo;s neck and kissed
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sybil, dear,&rdquo; she said affectionately,
and then stopped.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for some time, looking at the
great logs burning in the deep fire-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sybil, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Wyndham began again,
presently, &ldquo;why did you refuse Vancouver? You
do not mind telling me, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;It
makes no difference now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, perhaps not. Only I always thought it strange.
He must have done something you did not like, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was it. He did something I did not
like. Mr. Harrington would have said he had a perfect
right to do as he pleased. But I could not marry him
after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it anything so very bad?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Wyndham, affectionately, smoothing Sybil&rsquo;s thick
fair hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not as deep as a well, nor as broad
as a house,&rdquo; said Sybil, with a faint, scornful
laugh; &ldquo;but it was enough. It would do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell me, dear,&rdquo; persisted
Mrs. Wyndham. &ldquo;I have a particular reason for
wanting to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I would not have told before this other
affair came out,&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;I would
not marry him because he tried to find out from poor
mamma&rsquo;s man of business whether we were rich.
And the day after he got the information that I was
rich enough to suit him, he proposed. But mamma knew
all about what had gone on and told me, and so I refused
him. She said I was wrong, and would not have told
me if she had known it would make any difference.
And now you say I was right. I am sure I was; it was
only a fancy I had for him, because he was so clever
and well-bred. Besides, he is much too old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is old enough to be your father, my dear,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Wyndham; &ldquo;but I think you were a little
hard on him. Almost any man would do the same. We
here in Boston, of course, always know about each other.
It was a little mean of him, no doubt, but it was
not a mortal crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was low,&rdquo; said Sybil, decisively.
&ldquo;To think of a man as rich as that caring for
a paltry twenty or thirty thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham,
&ldquo;it is mean; but they all do it, and life is
uncertain, and so is business I suppose, and twenty
or thirty thousand a year does make a difference to
most people, I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham looked at the fire reflectively, as though
not absolutely certain of the truth of the proposition.
Sam Wyndham was commonly reputed to be worth a dozen
millions or so. He would have been very well off even
in New York, and in Boston he was rich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would make a great difference to me,&rdquo;
said Sybil, laughing, &ldquo;for it is all I have
in the world. But I am glad I refused Vancouver on
that ground, all the same. If it had not been for
that I should have married him&ndash;just imagine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just imagine!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Wyndham.
&ldquo;And to have had him turn out such an abominable
blackguard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no mistaking what you think of him
now, at all events,&rdquo; said Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear. And now we have talked so long
that it is time to dress for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How Mrs. Wyndham went to the party and met Joe Thorn
has already been told. It was no wonder that Mrs.
Sam treated Vancouver so coldly, and she repulsed
him again more than once during the evening. When Joe
was gone, John Harrington went up to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came very late,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
at first I could not find you, and then I had to say
something to Miss Thorn. But I wanted to see you especially.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me your arm,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham,
&ldquo;and we will go into the conservatory. I have
something especial to say to you, too.&rdquo; Once
out of the thick of the party, they sat down. &ldquo;I
have discovered something more about our amiable friend,&rdquo;
she continued. &ldquo;It is a side-light on his character&ndash;something
he did a year and a half ago. Do you remember his
flirtation with Sybil Brandon at Saratoga and then
at Newport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was in Newport most of the summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know why she refused him, though.
It&rsquo;s perfectly rich!&rdquo; Mrs. Sam laughed
dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I only know she did, and every one seemed
very much astonished,&rdquo; answered John.  &ldquo;She
refused him because he had been trying to find out
how much she was worth. It speaks volumes for the characters
of both of them, does it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;What
a Jew that man is! He is as rich as Croesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, as I told her, most men would do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; John answered, laughing
a little. &ldquo;A man the other night told me he
was going to make inquiries concerning the fortunes
of his beloved one. He said he had no idea of buying
a pig in a poke. That was graceful, was it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham laughed aloud. &ldquo;He was honest,
at all events. By the bye, do you know you have a
fanatic admirer in Sybil Brandon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, really? I like her very much, too: and
I am very glad if she likes me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said she would not marry you if you asked
her, though,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sam, laughing again.
&ldquo;You see you must not flatter yourself too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not. I should not think of asking her
to marry me. Did she give any especial reason why
she would inevitably refuse me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed; she said you were lion-like, and,
oh, the most delightful things! But she said she would
not marry you if you asked her, because you are a
celebrity and devoted to your career, so that there
is no room for a woman in your life. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; said John, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Perhaps she is right in the way she means.
I never thought much about it.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Chapter XII.</h1>

<p>The idea Joe had formed about Vancouver was just,
in the main, and she was not far wrong in disliking
him and thinking him dangerous. Nevertheless John
Harrington understood the man better. Vancouver was
so constituted that his fine intellect and quick perception
were unsupported by any strong principle of individuality.
He was not capable of hatred&ndash;he could only be spiteful;
he could not love, he could only give a woman what
he could spare of himself. He would at all times rather
avoid an open encounter, but he rarely neglected an
opportunity of dealing a thrust at any one he disliked,
when he could do so safely. He was the very opposite
of John, who never said of any one what he would not
say to themselves, and granted to every man the broadest
right of judgment and freedom of opinion. Nevertheless
there was not enough real strength in anything Vancouver
felt to make him very dangerous as an opponent, nor
valuable as a friend. Had it not been for the important
position he had attained by his clever subtlety in
affairs, and by the assistance of great railroad magnates
who found in him a character and intelligence precisely
suited to their ends, Pocock Vancouver would have
been a neutral figure in the world, lacking both the
enterprise to create an idea and the courage to follow
it out. It was most characteristic of his inherent
smallness, that in spite of his wealth and the very
large operations that must be constantly occupying
his thoughts, he could demean himself to write anonymous
articles in a daily paper, in the hope of injuring
a man he disliked.</p>

<p>It is true that his feeling against Harrington was
as strong as anything in his nature. He detested John&rsquo;s
strength because he had once made him a confidence
and John had done him a favor. He disliked him also
because he knew that wherever they chanced to be together
John received an amount of consideration and even
of respect which he himself could not obtain with
all his money and all his cleverness. His mind, too,
delighted in detail and revolted against John&rsquo;s
sweeping generalities. For these several reasons Vancouver
had taken great delight in writing and printing sundry
vicious criticisms upon John in the absolute certainty
of not being found out. The editor of the paper did
not know Vancouver&rsquo;s name, for the articles
came through the post with a modest request that they
might be inserted if they were of any use; and they
were generally so pungent and to the point that the
editor was glad to get them, especially as no remuneration
was demanded.</p>

<p>As for the confidence Vancouver had once made to John,
it was another instance of his littleness. At the
time when Vancouver was anxious to marry Sybil Brandon,
John Harrington was very intimate at the house, and
was, in Vancouver&rsquo;s opinion, a dangerous rival;
at all events he felt that the contest was not an
agreeable one, nor altogether to his own advantage.
Accordingly he tried every means to clear the coast,
as he expressed it; but although John probably had
no intention of marrying Sybil, and Sybil certainly
had never thought of marrying John, the latter was
fond of her society, and of her mother&rsquo;s, and
came to the cottage on the Newport cliff with a regularity
that drove Vancouver to the verge of despair. Pocock
at last could bear it no longer and asked John to
dinner. Over a bottle of Pommery Sec he confided his
passion, and hinted that John was the obstacle to
his wooing. Harrington raised his eyebrows, smiled,
wished Vancouver all success, and left Newport the
next day. If Vancouver had not disgusted Sybil by
his inquiries concerning her fortune, he would have
married her, and his feelings towards John would have
been different. But to know that Harrington had done
him the favor of going away, knowing that he was about
to offer himself to Miss Brandon, and then to have
failed in his suit was more than the vanity of Mr.
Pocock Vancouver could bear with any sort of calmness,
and the consequence was that he disliked John as much
as he disliked anybody or anything in the world. There
is no resentment like the resentment of wounded vanity,
nor any self-reproach like that of a man who has shown
his weakness.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Wyndham told John the story of Vancouver&rsquo;s
failure he could have told her the rest, had he chosen,
and she would certainly have been very much amused.
But John was not a man to betray a confidence, even
that of a man who had injured him, and so he merely
laughed and kept his own counsel. He would have scorned
to speak to Vancouver about the articles, or to make
any change in his manner towards him. As he had said
to Josephine, he had expected nothing from the man,
and now he was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Vancouver, who was weakly but frequently
susceptible to the charms of woman, had made up his
mind that if Josephine had enough pin-money she would
make him an admirable wife, and he accordingly began
to make love to her in his own fashion, as has been
seen. A day or two earlier Joe would have laughed
at him, and it would perhaps have amused her to hear
what he had to say, as it amuses most young women to
listen to pretty speeches. But Joe was between two
fires, so to speak; she was under the two influences
that were strongest with her. She loved John Harrington
with all her heart, and she hated Vancouver with all
her strength. It is true that her hatred was the only
acknowledged passion, for her maidenly nature was
not able yet to comprehend her love; and the mere thought
that she cared for a man who did not care for her
brought the hot blush to her cheek. But the love was
in her heart all the same, strong and enduring, so
that Vancouver found the fortress doubly guarded.</p>

<p>He could not entirely explain to himself her conduct
at the party. She had always seemed rather willing
to accept his attentions and to listen to his conversation,
but on this particular evening, just when he wished
to make a most favorable impression, she had treated
him with surprising coldness. There was a supreme
superiority in the way she had at first declined his
services, and had then told him he might be permitted
to get her a glass of water. The subsequent satisfaction
of having ousted Mr. Bonamy Biggielow, the little
poet, from his position at her side was small enough,
and was more than counterbalanced and destroyed by
her returning to her chaperon at the first soft-tongued
insinuation of a desire to flirt, which Vancouver
ventured to speak. Moreover, when Harrington almost
pushed him aside and sat down by Josephine, Vancouver
could bear it no longer, but turned on his heel and
went away, with black thoughts in his heart. It seemed
as though John was to be always in his way.</p>

<p>It would be hard to say what he would have felt had
he known that Josephine Thorn, John Harrington, and
Mrs. Sam Wyndham all knew of his journalistic doings.
And yet it was nearly certain that no one of the three
would ever speak to him on the subject. Joe would not,
because she knew John would not like it; John himself
despised the whole business too much to condescend
to reproach Vancouver; and, finally, Mrs. Wyndham was
too much a woman of the world to be willing to cause
a scandal when it could possibly be avoided. She liked
Vancouver too, and regretted what he had done. Her
liking only extended to his conversation and agreeable
manners, for she was beginning to despise his character;
but he had so long been an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> about
the house that she could not make up her mind to turn
him out. But for all that, she could not help being
cold to him at first.</p>

<p>John himself was too busy with important matters to
bestow much thought on Vancouver or his doings. His
day had been spent in interviews and letter-writing;
fifty people had been to see him at his rooms, and
he had dispatched more than that number of letters.
At five o&rsquo;clock he had slipped out with the
intention of dining at his club before any one else
was there, but he had met Mrs. Wyndham in the street,
and had spent his dinner-hour with her. At half-past
six he had another appointment in his rooms, and it
was not till nearly eleven that he was able to get
away and look in upon the party, when he met Joe.
For a week this kind of life would probably last,
and then all would be over, in one way or another,
but meanwhile the excitement was intense.</p>

<p>On the next day Ronald came to see Joe before ten
o&rsquo;clock. The time hung heavily on his hands,
and he found it impossible to occupy himself with
his troubles. There were moments when the first impression
of disappointment returned upon him very strongly,
but he was conscious of a curious duplicity about
his feelings, and he knew well enough in his inmost
heart that he was only evoking a fictitious regret
out of respect for what he thought he ought to feel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about the people here, Joe,&rdquo;
said he, sitting down beside her almost as though
nothing had happened. &ldquo;Who is Mrs. Wyndham, to
begin with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wyndham&ndash;she is Sam Wyndham&rsquo;s wife.
Just that,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Sam Wyndham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;he is one of the prevalent profession.
He is a millionaire. In fact he is one of the real
ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do they get to be real?&rdquo; asked Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, when they have more than ten millions.
The other ones do not count much. It is much more
the thing to be poor, unless you have ten millions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is something in my favor, at all events,&rdquo;
said Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much. You have been to see Mrs. Wyndham,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I went yesterday, and she has asked
me to dinner to-night. It is awfully good of her,
I must say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will like her very much, and Sybil Brandon
too,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Sybil is an adorable
creature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is most decidedly good-looking, certainly.
There is no doubt about it.&rdquo; Ronald pulled his
delicate moustache a little. &ldquo;Though she is quite
different style from you, Joe,&rdquo; he added presently,
as though he had discovered a curious fact in natural
history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Sybil is a great beauty, and I am
only pretty,&rdquo; answered Joe in perfectly good
faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are a great beauty too,&rdquo;
said Ronald critically. &ldquo;I am sure most people
think so, and I have heard lots of men say so. Besides,
you are much more striking-looking than she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Ronald!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe&ndash;who is Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vancouver! Why do you ask especially?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very natural, I am sure,&rdquo; said
Ronald in a somewhat injured tone. &ldquo;You wrote
about him. He was the only person you mentioned in
your letter-that is, he and a man called Harrington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Vancouver&ndash;Mr. Pocock Vancouver&ndash;is a middle-aged
man of various accomplishments,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;more
especially distinguished by the fact that Sybil Brandon
refused to marry him some time ago. He is an enemy
of Mr. Harrington&rsquo;s, and they are both friends
of Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated Ronald, &ldquo;and who
is Harrington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Harrington is a very clever person
who has to do with politics,&rdquo; said Joe, without
hesitation, but as she continued she blushed a little.
&ldquo;He is always being talked about because he wants
to reform everything. He is a great friend of ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;I thought so,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;What
sort of a fellow is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he is five-and-thirty years old;
he is neither tall nor short, and he has red hair,&rdquo;
said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a beauty!&rdquo; laughed Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not at all ugly, you know,&rdquo; said
Joe, still blushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I ever see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see him to-night at Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s;
he told me he was going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;are you going too, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I have another dinner-party. You will have
to do without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall always have to do without
you, now.&rdquo; said Ronald disconsolately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Ronald!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; repeated Surbiton in injured
tones. &ldquo;You call it silly to be cut up when
one is treated as you have treated me! It is too bad,
Joe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a dear, silly old thing,&rdquo; said
his cousin affectionately, &ldquo;and I will say it
as much as I please. It is ever so much better, because
we can always be like brother and sister now, and
we shall not marry and quarrel over everything till
we hate each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are very heartless, all the same,&rdquo;
said Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Ronald"-</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will go and marry one of these middle-aged
people with red hair&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; said Joe, stamping her little
foot. &ldquo;Listen to me. I will not marry you because
I like you and I do not love you, and I never mean
to marry any middle-aged person. I shall not marry
at all, most probably. Will you please to imagine
what life would have been like if we had married first,
and found out afterwards that we had made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course that would have been awful,&rdquo;
said Ronald. &ldquo;But then it would not be a mistake,
because I love you&ndash;like anything, Joe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense! You are quite mistaken, my dear
boy, because some day you will fall desperately in
love with some one else, and you will like me just
as much as ever&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I should,&rdquo; said Ronald indignantly.
&ldquo;Nothing would ever make any difference at all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Ronald,&rdquo; retorted Joe laughing,
&ldquo;if you were desperately in love with some one
else, how could you still be just as fond of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I should,&rdquo; said
Ronald. &ldquo;Besides, it is absurd, for I shall
never love any one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see; but of course if you never do,
we shall always be just the same as we are now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;that would not be so bad, you know,&rdquo;
said Ronald with a certain air of resignation.</p>

<p>After this conversation Ronald became reconciled to
the situation. Joe&rsquo;s remark that he would be
able to love some one else very much without being&ndash;any
the less fond of herself made him reflect, and he came
to the conclusion that the case was conceivable after
all. He therefore agreed within himself that he would
think no more about the matter for the present, but
would take what came in his way, and trust that Joe
would ultimately change her mind. But he went to Mrs.
Wyndham&rsquo;s that evening with a firm determination
to dislike John Harrington to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>A middle-aged man with red hair! Five-and-thirty was
undoubtedly middle-age. Short, too. But Joe had blushed,
and there was no doubt about it; this was the man
who had won her affections. Ronald would hate him
cordially.</p>

<p>But John refused to be hated. His manner was easy
and courteous, but not gentle. He was evidently no
lady&rsquo;s man. He talked to the men more than to
the women, and he was utterly without affectation.
Indeed, he was not in the least like what Ronald had
expected.</p>

<p>Moreover, Ronald was seated next to Sybil Brandon
at dinner, and drove every one away who tried to disturb
the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> he succeeded in procuring
with her afterwards. He was surprised at his own conduct,
but he somehow connected it in his mind with his desire
to hate Harrington. It was not very clear to himself,
and it certainly would have been incomprehensible
to any one else, but the presence of Harrington stimulated
him in his efforts to amuse Miss Brandon.</p>

<p>Sybil, too, in her quiet way, was very willing to
be amused, and she found in Ronald Surbiton an absolute
freshness of ideas that gave her a new sense of pleasure.
Her affair with Vancouver had made a deep impression
on her mind, and her mother&rsquo;s death soon afterwards
had had the effect of withdrawing her entirely from
the world. It was no wonder, therefore, that she liked
this young Englishman, so different from most of the
men she knew best. It was natural, too, that he should
want to talk to her, for she was the only young girl
present. At last, as Ronald began to feel that intimacy
which sometimes grows out of a simple conversation
between two sympathetic people, he turned to the subject
he had most in mind, if not most in his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and my cousin are very intimate, Miss Brandon,
I believe?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;I have grown very fond of her in a few
weeks.&rdquo; Sybil wondered whether Ronald was going
to make confidences. It seemed to her rather early
in the acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she told me,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;She
is very fond of you, too; I went to see her this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you go every day,&rdquo; said Sybil,
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;not every day,&rdquo; answered Ronald.
&ldquo;But this morning I was asking her about some
of the people here. She seems to know every one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed, she is immensely popular. Whom
did she tell you about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;Mrs. Wyndham, and Mr. Wyndham, and Mr.
Vancouver, and Mr. Harrington. He is immensely clever,
she says,&rdquo; added Ronald, with a touch of irony
in his voice. &ldquo;What do you think about him,
Miss Brandon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot judge very well,&rdquo; said Sybil.
&ldquo;He is a great friend of mine, and I do not
care in the least whether my friends are clever or
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe does,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;She hates
stupid people. She is very clever too, you know, and
so I suppose she is right about Harrington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I was only speaking of myself,&rdquo;
answered Sybil. &ldquo;He is probably the strongest
man in this part of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks strong,&rdquo; said Ronald, who was
a judge of athletes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean in the way of brains,&rdquo; said Sybil.
&ldquo;But he is more than that, for he is so splendidly
honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But lots of people are honest,&rdquo; said
Ronald, who did not want to concede too much to the
man he meant to dislike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but not so much as he is. I do not
believe John Harrington ever in his life said anything
that could possibly convey a false impression, or
ever betrayed a confidence.&rdquo; Sybil looked calmly
across the room at John, who was talking earnestly
to Sam Wyndham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But has he no defects at all? What a model
of faultlessness!&rdquo; exclaimed Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People say he is self-centred, whatever that
may mean. He is certainly a very ambitious man, but
his ambitions are large, and he makes no secret of
them. He will make a great stir in the world some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald would have liked to ask about Vancouver also,
but he fortunately remembered what Joe had told him
that morning, and did not ask his questions of Sybil.
But he went home that night wondering what manner of
man this Harrington might be, concerning whom such
great things were said. He was conscious also that
he had not been very wise in what he had asked of
Sybil, and he was dissatisfied at not having heard
anything about the friendship that existed between
Harrington and Joe. But on the whole he had enjoyed
the evening very much&ndash;almost too much, when he remembered
the things Joe had said to him in the morning. It
ought not to be possible, he thought, for a jilted
lover to look so pleasantly on life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam Wyndham to his wife when
everybody was gone, and he had lit a big cigar; &ldquo;well,
it was a pleasant kind of an evening, was not it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sam, sitting down in
a low easy-chair for a chat with her husband. &ldquo;What
a nice boy that young Englishman is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just going to say so,&rdquo; said Sam.
&ldquo;He made himself pretty comfortable with Sybil,
did he not? I could not help thinking they looked
a very pretty pair as they sat in that corner. What
is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is Miss Thorn&rsquo;s cousin. Sam, you really
must not drop your ashes on the carpet. There are
no end of saucers and things about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the carpet, my dear,&rdquo; said
Sam good-naturedly; &ldquo;tell me about that young
fellow&ndash;what is his name?&ndash;Surbiton, is not it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;well, there is not very much to tell.
He is here traveling for amusement, just like any
other young Englishman. For my part I expected he
had come here to marry his cousin, because Englishmen
always marry their cousins. But Sybil says it is not
true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does she come to know?&rdquo; inquired
Sam, rolling his cigar in his mouth and looking at
the ceiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Miss Thorn told her. She ought to
know, any way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one would think so. By the way, this
election is going to turn out a queer sort of a business,
I expect. John says the only thing that is doubtful
is that fellow Patrick Ballymolloy and his men. Now
is not that just about the queerest thing you ever
heard of? A set of Irishmen in the Legislature who
are not sure they can manage to vote for a Democratic
senator?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is something altogether new,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Wyndham. &ldquo;But it seems so funny that
John should come telling you all about his election,
when you are such a Republican, and would go straight
against him if you had anything to say about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he knows I don&rsquo;t vote or anything,&rdquo;
said Sam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t vote, because you
are not in the Legislature. But if you did, you would
go against him, would not you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not sure,&rdquo; answered Sam in
a drawl of uncertainty. &ldquo;I tell you what it
is, my dear, John Harrington is not such a bad Republican
after all, though he <i>is</i> a Democrat. And
it is my belief he could call himself a Republican,
and could profess to believe just the same things as
he does now, if he only took a little care.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Chapter XIII</h1>

<p>A council of three men sat in certain rooms, in Conduit
Street, London. There was nothing whatever about the
bachelor&rsquo;s front room overlooking the thoroughfare
to suggest secrecy, nor did any one of the three gentlemen
who sat in easy-chairs, with cigars in their mouths,
in any way resemble a conspirator. They were neither
masked nor wrapped in cloaks, but wore the ordinary
garb of fashionably civilized life. For the sake of
clearness and convenience, they can be designated
as X, Y, and Z. X was the president on the present
occasion, but the office was not held permanently,
devolving upon each of the three in succession at
each successive meeting.</p>

<p>X was a man sixty years of age, clean-shaved, with
smooth iron-gray hair and bushy eyebrows, from beneath
which shone a pair of preternaturally bright blue
eyes. His face was of a strong, even, healthy red;
he was stout, but rather thick and massive than corpulent;
his hands were of the square type, with thick straight
fingers and large nails, the great blue veins showing
strongly through the white skin. He was dressed in
black, as though in mourning, and his clothes fitted
smoothly over his short heavy figure.</p>

<p>Y was very tall and slight, and it was not easy to
make a guess at his age, for his hair was sandy and
thick, and his military moustache concealed the lines
about his mouth. His forehead was high and broad, and
the extreme prominence between his brows made his profile
look as though the facial angles were reversed, as
in certain busts of Greek philosophers. His fingers
were well shaped, but extremely long and thin. He
wore the high collar of the period, with a white tie
fastened by a pin consisting of a single large pearl,
and it was evident that the remainder of his dress
was with him a subject of great attention. Y might
be anywhere from forty to fifty years of age.</p>

<p>Z was the eldest of the three, and in some respects
the most remarkable in appearance. He was well proportioned,
except that his head seemed large for his body. His
face was perfectly colorless, and his thin hair was
white and long and disorderly. A fringe of snowy beard
encircled his throat like a scarf, but his lips and
cheeks were clean-shaved. The dead waxen whiteness
of his face was thrown into startling relief by his
great black eyes, in which there was a depth and a
fire when he was roused that contrasted strongly with
his aged appearance. His dress was simple in the extreme,
and of the darkest colors.</p>

<p>The three sat in their easy-chairs round the coal
fire. It was high noon in London, and the weather
was moderately fine; that is to say, it was possible
to read in the room without lighting the gas. X held
a telegram in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a perfectly clear case against us,&rdquo;
he remarked in a quiet, business-like manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has occurred at such an unfortunate time,&rdquo;
said Y, who spoke very slowly and distinctly, with
an English accent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall do it yet,&rdquo; said Z, confidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the president, &ldquo;it
will not do to hesitate. There is an individual in
this case who will not let the grass grow under his
feet. His name is Mr. Patrick Ballymolloy. We all
know about him, I expect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know him very well indeed,&rdquo; said old
Z. &ldquo;It was I who put him in the book.&rdquo;
He rose quickly and took a large volume from a shelf
near by. It was a sort of ledger, with the letters
of the alphabet printed on the cut edges of the leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Y knows him,&rdquo; said
the president. &ldquo;Please read him to us.&rdquo;
Z turned over the leaves quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;B&ndash;Bally&ndash;Ballymolloy-Patrick&ndash;Yes,&rdquo;
he said, finding the place. &ldquo;Patrick Ballymolloy.
Irish iron man. Boston, Mass. Drinks. Takes money from
both sides. Voted generally Democratic ticket. P.S.
1882, opposed B. in election for Governor. Iron interest
increased. P.S. 1883, owns twenty votes in House.
Costs more than he did. That is all,&rdquo; said Z,
shutting up the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite enough,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;Mr.
Patrick Ballymolloy and his twenty votes will bother
us. What a pity J.H. made that speech!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears that as Patrick has grown rich,
Patrick has grown fond of protection, then,&rdquo;
remarked Y, crossing one long leg over the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Z. &ldquo;That is it.
Now the question is, who owns Patrick? Anybody know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever can pay for him, I expect,&rdquo; said
the president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I have an idea,&rdquo; said the old man
suddenly, and again he dived into the book. &ldquo;Did
either of you ever know a man called Vancouver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;I know all about him,&rdquo; said Y, and
a contemptuous smile hinted beforehand what he thought
of the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made an entry about him the other day,&rdquo;
said the president. &ldquo;You will find a good deal
against his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; said Z again. &ldquo;Pocock
Vancouver. Railways. Rep. Boston, Mass. Was taxed
in 1870 for nearly a million dollars. Weak character,
very astute. Takes no money. Believed to be dissipated,
but he cleverly conceals it. Never votes. Has extensive
financial interests. 1880, taxed for nearly three
millions. 1881, paid ten thousand dollars to Patrick
Ballymolloy (D) for carrying a motion for the Monadminck
Railroad (see Railroads). 1882, voted for Butler&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo; exclaimed the president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Z, &ldquo;there is more.
1883, thought to be writer of articles against J.H.
in Boston &lsquo;Daily Standard.&rsquo; Subsequently
confirmed by J.H. That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the president, &ldquo;that
last note is mine. Harrington wired it yesterday with
other things. But I was hurried and did not read his
old record. Things could not be much worse. You see
Harrington has no book with him, or he would know
all this, and be on the lookout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he figured it out?&rdquo; inquired Y.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has figured it out. He is a first-rate
man, and he has the whole thing down cold. Ballymolloy
and his twenty votes will carry the election, and
if Vancouver cares he can buy Mr. Ballymolloy as he
has done before. He does care, if he is going to take
the trouble to write articles against J.H., depend
upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there is nothing for it,&rdquo; said
Z, who, in spite of his age, was the most impulsive
of the three. &ldquo;We must buy Ballymolloy ourselves,
with his twenty men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that would be a mistake,&rdquo; said
the president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said Z. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
he asked, turning to Y.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Y.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will argue it, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Z.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;I
will begin.&rdquo; He settled himself in his chair
and knocked the ashes from his cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will begin by stating the exact position,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;In the first place this whole affair
is accidental, resulting from the death of the junior
senator. No one could foresee this event. We had arranged
to put in John Harrington at the regular vacancy next
year, and we are now very busy with a most important
business here in London. If we were on the spot, as
one of us could have been had we known that the senator
would die, it would have been another matter. This
thing will be settled by next Saturday at the latest,
but probably earlier. I am opposed to buying Ballymolloy,
because it is an uncertain purchase. He has taken money
from both sides, and if he has the chance he will
do it again. If we were present it would be different,
for we could hold him to his bargain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not like buying, and we only do it in
very urgent cases, and when we are certain of the
result. To buy without certainty is simply to begin
a system of reckless bribery, which is exactly what
we want to put down. Moreover, it is a bad plan to
bribe a man who is interested in iron. The man in
that business ought to be with us any way, without
anything but a little talking to. When you have stated
any reasons to the contrary I will tell you what I
propose instead. That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the president&rsquo;s little speech, Y and
Z had listened attentively. When he had finished,
Z turned in his chair and took his cigar from his
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Z, &ldquo;that the case
is urgent. The question is just about coming to a
head, and we want all the men we can get at any price.
It will not do to let a chance slip. If we can put
J.H. in the senate now, we may put another man in
at the vacancy. That makes two men instead of one.
I am aware that it would be an improbable thing to
get two of our men in for Massachusetts; but I believe
it can be done, and for that reason I think we ought
to make an effort to get J.H. in now. It may cost something,
but I do not believe it is uncertain. I expect Vancouver
is not the sort of man to spend much just for the
sake of spite. The question of buying as a rule is
another matter. None of us want that; but if the case
is urgent I think there is no question about its being
right. Of course it is a great pity J.H. said anything
about protection in that speech. He did not mean to,
but he could not help it, and at all events he had
no idea his election was so near. If we are not certain
of the result, J.H. ought to withdraw, because it
will injure his chance at the vacancy to have him
defeated now. That is all I have to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am of opinion,&rdquo; said the president,
&ldquo;that our best plan is to let John Harrington
take his chance. You know who his opponent is, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ira C. Calvin,&rdquo; said Y and Z together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calvin refused last night,&rdquo; said the
president, &ldquo;and they have put Jobbins in his
place. Here is the telegram. It is code three,&rdquo;
he remarked, handing it to Z.</p>

<p>Z read it, and his face expressed the greatest surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jobbins belongs to us,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;He will not move hand or foot unless we advise
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;But
Mr. Ballymolloy does not know that, nor any other
member of the Legislature. Harrington himself does
not know it. Verdict, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verdict against buying,&rdquo; said Y.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Z. &ldquo;What a set
of fools they are! How about withdrawing Harrington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I object,&rdquo; said the president. &ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it will injure his chance at the vacancy
to have him defeated now, as I said before. That is
all,&rdquo; said Z.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be dangerous to withdraw him
before so weak a man as Jobbins. It would hurt his
reputation. Besides, our second man is in Washington
arguing a case; and, after all, there is a bare chance
that J.H. may win. If he does not, we win all the
same, for Jobbins is in chains. Verdict, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Y was silent, and smoked thoughtfully. For five minutes
no one spoke, and the president occupied the time
in arranging some papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him stand his chance,&rdquo; said Y, at
last. In spite of the apparent informality of the
meetings of the three, there was an unchangeable rule
in their proceedings. Whenever a question arose, the
member who first objected to the proposition argued
the case briefly, or at length, with the proposer,
and the third gave the verdict, against which there
was no appeal.</p>

<p>These three strong men possessed between them an enormous
power. It rarely happened that they could all meet
together and settle upon their course of action by
word of month, but constant correspondence and the
use of an extensive set of telegraphic codes kept
them in unbroken communication. No oaths or ceremonies
bound them together, for they belonged to a small
community of men which has existed from the earliest
days of American independence, and which took its
rise before that period.</p>

<p>Into this council of three, men of remarkable ability
and spotless character were elected without much respect
of age whenever a vacancy occurred. They worked quietly,
with one immutable political purpose, with which they
allowed no prejudiced party view to interfere. Always
having under their immediate control some of the best
talent in the country, and frequently commanding vast
financial resources, these men and their predecessors
had more than once turned the scale of the country&rsquo;s
future. They had committed great mistakes, but they
had also brought about noble results. It had frequently
occurred that all the three members of the council
simultaneously held seats in the senate, or that one
or more were high in office. More than one President
since Washington had sat at one time or another in
the triumvirate; secretaries of state, orators, lawyers,
financiers, and philanthropists had given the best
years of their lives to the duties of the council;
and yet, so perfect was the organization, the tests
were so careful, and so marvelously profound was the
insight of the leaders into human character, that of
all these men, not one had ever betrayed the confidence
placed in him. In the truest sense they and their
immediate supporters formed an order; an order of
true men, with whom the love of justice, honor, and
freedom took the place of oath and ceremonial, binding
them by stronger obligations than ever bound a ring
of conspirators or a community of religious zealots.</p>

<p>The great element of secrecy as regards the outer
world lay in the fact that only two men at any one
time knew of the existence of the council of three,
and these were those who were considered fit to sit
in the council themselves. Even these two did not
know more than one of the three leaders as such, though
probably personally and even intimately acquainted
with all three. The body of men whom the council controlled
was ignorant of its existence therefore, and was composed
of the personal adherents of each of the three. Manifestly
one member of the council could, with the consent
and cooperation of the other two, command the influence
of the whole body of political adherents in favor
of one of his friends, at any time, leaving the individual
in entire ignorance of the power employed for his
advancement. When a vacancy occurred in the council,
by death or old age of any member, one of the two
already designated took the place, while the other
remained ignorant of the fact that any change had occurred,
unless the vacancy was caused by the withdrawal of
the member he had known, in which case he was put
in communication with that member with whom he was
most intimately acquainted. By this system of management
no one man knew more than one of the actual leaders
until he was himself one of the three. At the present
time Z had been in the council nearly thirty years,
and X for upwards of twenty, while Y, who was in reality
fifty years old, had received his seat fifteen years
before, at the age of thirty-five. A year ago one
of the men selected to fill a possible vacancy had
died, and John Harrington was chosen in his place.</p>

<p>It has been seen that the three kept a sort of political
ledger, which was always in the hands of the president
for the time being, whose duty it was to make the
insertions necessary from time to time. Some conception
of the extent and value of the book may be formed
from the fact that it contained upwards of ten thousand
names, including those of almost every prominent man,
and of not a few remarkable women in the principal
centres of the country. The details given were invariably
brief and to the point, written down in a simple but
safe form of cipher which was perfectly familiar to
every one of the three. This vast mass of information
was simply the outcome of the personal experience
of the leaders, and of their trusted friends, but
no detail which could by any possibility be of use
escaped being committed to paper, and the result was
in many cases a positive knowledge of future events,
which, to any one unacquainted with the system, must
have appeared little short of miraculous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is it in Boston?&rdquo; inquired
the president, rising and going to the writing-table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-eight minutes past seven,&rdquo; said
Y, producing an enormous three-dial time-piece, set
to indicate simultaneously the time of day in London,
Boston, and Washington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, there is plenty of time,&rdquo;
answered X, writing out a dispatch on a broad white
sheet of cable office paper. &ldquo;See here&ndash;is this
all right?&rdquo; he asked, when he had done.</p>

<p>The message ran as follows: &ldquo;Do not withdraw.
If possible gain Ballymolloy and men, but on no account
pay for them. If asked, say iron protection necessary
at present, and probably for many years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Y and Z read the telegram, and said it would do. In
ten minutes it was taken to the telegraph office by
X&rsquo;s servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said X, lighting a fresh cigar,
&ldquo;we have disposed of this accident, and we can
turn to our regular business. The question is broadly,
what effect will be produced by suddenly throwing eight
or ten millions of English money into an American
enterprise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Englishmen are not making money, they
are a particularly disagreeable set of people to deal
with,&rdquo; remarked Y, who would have been taken
for an Englishman himself in any part of the world.</p>

<p>And so the council left John Harrington, and turned
to other matters which do not in any way concern this
tale.</p>

<p>John received the dispatch at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock
in the morning after the dinner at Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s,
and he read it without comprehending precisely the
position taken by his instructor. Nevertheless, the
order coincided with what he would have done if left
to himself. He of course could not know that even
if his opponent were elected it would be a gain to
his own party, for the outward life of Mr. Jobbins
gave no cause for believing that he was in anybody&rsquo;s
power. Harrington was left to suppose that, if he
failed to get the votes of Patrick Ballymolloy and
his party, the election would be a dead loss. Nevertheless,
he rejoiced that the said Patrick was not to be bought.
An honorable failure, wherein he might honestly say
that he had bribed no one, nor used any undue pressure,
would in his opinion be better than to be elected
ten times over by money and promises of political
jobbery.</p>

<p>The end rarely justifies the means, and there are
means so foul that they would blot any result into
their own filthiness. All that the world can write;
or think, or say, will never make it honorable or noble
to bribe and tell lies. Men who lie are not brave
because they are willing to be shot at, in some instances,
by the men their falsehoods have injured. Men who
pay others to agree with them are doing a wrong upon
the dignity of human nature, and they very generally
end by saying that human nature has no dignity at
all, and very possibly by being themselves corrupted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so great is the interest which men,
even upright and honorable men, take in the aims they
follow, that they believe it possible to wade knee-deep
through mud, and then ascend to the temple of fame
without dragging the mud with them, and befouling the
white marble steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Political necessity!&rdquo; What deeds are
done in thy name! What a merciful and polite goddess
was the necessity of the ancients, compared with the
necessity of the moderns. Political necessity has been
hard at work in our times from Robespierre to Sedan,
from St. Helena to the Vatican, from the Tea-chests
of Boston Harbor to the Great Rebellion. Political
necessity has done more lying, more bribery, more
murdering, and more stealing in a century, than could
have been invented by all the Roman emperors together,
with the assistance of the devil himself.</p>

<h1>Chapter XIV.</h1>

<p>In all the endless folk-lore of proverbs, there is
perhaps no adage more true than that which warns young
people to beware of a new love until they have done
with the old, and as Ronald Surbiton reflected on his
position, the old rhyme ran through his head. Ho was
strongly attracted by Sybil Brandon, but, at the same
time, he still felt that he ought to make an effort
to win Joe back. It seemed so unmanly to relinquish
her without a struggle, just because she said she
did not love him. It could not be true, for they had
loved each other so long.</p>

<p>When Ronald looked out of the window of his room in
the hotel, on the morning after Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s
dinner, the snow was falling as it can only fall in
Boston. The great houses opposite were almost hidden
from view by the soft, fluttering flakes, and below,
in the broad street, the horse-cars moved slowly
along like immense white turtles ploughing their way
through deep white sand. The sound of the bells was
muffled as it came up, and the scraping of the Irishmen&rsquo;s
heavy spades on the pavement before the hotel followed
by the regular fall of the great shovels full on the
heap, as they stacked the snow, sounded like the digging
of a gigantic grave.</p>

<p>Ronald felt that his spirits were depressed. He watched
the drifting storm for a few minutes, and then turned
away and looked for a novel in his bag, and filled
a pipe with some English tobacco he had jealously guarded
from the lynx-eyed custom-house men in New York, and
then sat down with a sigh before his small coal fire,
and prepared to pass the morning, in solitude.</p>

<p>But Ronald was not fond of reading, and at the end
of half an hour he threw his book and his pipe aside,
and stretched his long limbs. Then he rose and went
to the window again with an expression of utter weariness
such as only an Englishman can put on when he is thoroughly
bored. The snow was falling as thickly as ever, and
the turtle-backed horse-cars crawled by through the
drifts, more and more slowly. Ronald turned away with
an impatient ejaculation, and made up his mind that
he would go and see Joe at once. He wrapped himself
carefully in a huge ulster overcoat and went out.</p>

<p>Joe was sitting alone in the drawing-room, curled
up in an old-fashioned arm-chair by the fire, with
a book in her lap which she was not reading. She had
asked her aunt for something about politics, and Miss
Schenectady had given her the &ldquo;Life of Rufus
Choate,&rdquo; in two large black volumes. The book
was interesting, but in Joe&rsquo;s mind it was but
a step from the speeches and doings of the great and
brilliant lawyer-senator to the speeches and doings
of John Harrington. And so after a while the book
dropped upon her knee and she leaned far back in the
chair, her great brown eyes staring dreamily at the
glowing coals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so awfully lonely,&rdquo; said Ronald,
sitting down beside her, &ldquo;that I came here.
You do not mind, Joe, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind? No! I am very glad. It must be dreadfully
lonely for you at the hotel. What have you been doing
with yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;trying to read. And then, I was thinking
about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not much of an occupation. See how
industrious I am. I have been reading the &lsquo;Life
and Writings of Rufus Choate.&rsquo; I am getting to
be a complete Bostonian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you read it all? I never heard of him.
Who was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was an extremely clever man. He must have
been very nice, and his speeches are splendid. You
ought to read them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe, you are going to be a regular blue-stocking!
The idea of spending your time in reading such stuff.
Why, it would be almost better to read the parliamentary
reports in the &lsquo;Times!&rsquo; Just fancy!&rdquo;
Ronald laughed at the idea of any human being descending
to such drudgery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Ronald. You do not know
anything about it,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is of no use discussing the question,&rdquo;
answered Ronald. &ldquo;You young women are growing
altogether too clever, with your politics, and your
philosophy, and your culture. I hate America!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you really knew anything about it, you would
like it very much. Besides, you have no right to say
you hate it. The people here have been very good to
you already. You ought not to abuse them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;not the people. But just look at that snow-storm,
Joe, and tell me whether America is a place for human
beings to live in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is much prettier than a Scotch mist, and
ever so much clearer than a fog in London,&rdquo;
retorted Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is nothing for a fellow to do on
a day like this,&rdquo; said Ronald sulkily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, but to come and see his cousin, and
abuse everything to her, and try to make her as discontented
as himself,&rdquo; said Joe, mimicking his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought you liked me to come and see you&rdquo;&ndash;began
Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be different, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you when you are nice and good-tempered,&rdquo;
said Joe. &ldquo;But when you are bored you are simply&ndash;well,
you are dreadful.&rdquo; Joe raised her eyebrows and
tapped with her fingers on the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I can ever be bored when I come
to see you, Joe?&rdquo; asked Ronald, changing his
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You act as if you were, precisely. You know
people who are bored are generally bores themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;How kind
you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do say something nice, Ronald. You have done
nothing but find fault since you came. Have you heard
from home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. There has not been time yet. Why do you
ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I thought you might say something less
disagreeable about home than you seem able to say
about things here,&rdquo; said Joe tartly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not want me this morning. I will go
away again,&rdquo; said Ronald with a gloomy frown.
He rose to his feet, as though about to take his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go, Ronald.&rdquo; He paused.
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Joe, &ldquo;Sybil will
be here in a little while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not offer me Miss Brandon as an inducement
to stay with you, Joe, if you really want me. Twenty
Miss Brandons would not make any difference!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Joe smiling. &ldquo;You
are a dear good boy, Ronald, when you are nice,&rdquo;
she added presently. &ldquo;Sit down again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald went back to his seat beside her, and they
were both silent for a while. Joe repented a little,
for she thought she had been teasing him, and she
reflected that she ought to be doing her best to make
him happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe&ndash;do not you think it would be very pleasant
to be always like this?&rdquo; said Ronald after a
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&ndash;like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Together,&rdquo; said Ronald softly, and a
gentle look came into his handsome face, as he looked
up at his cousin. &ldquo;Together&ndash;only in our own
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe did not answer, but the color came to her cheeks,
and she looked annoyed. She had hoped that the matter
was settled forever, for it seemed so easy for her.
Ronald misinterpreted the blush. For the moment the
old conviction came back to him that she was to be
his wife, and if it was not exactly love that he felt,
it was a satisfaction almost great enough to take
its place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it not?&rdquo; said he presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do not talk about it, Ronald. What is
the use? I have said all there is to say, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have not,&rdquo; he answered, insisting.
&ldquo;Please, Joe dearest, think about it seriously.
Think what a cruel thing it is you are doing.&rdquo;
His voice was very tender, but he was perfectly calm;
there was not the slightest vibration of passion in
the tones. Joe did not wholly understand; she only
knew that he was not satisfied with the first explanation
she had given him, and that she felt sorry for him,
but was incapable of changing her decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must I go over it all again?&rdquo; she asked
piteously. &ldquo;Did I not make it clear to you,
Ronald? Oh&ndash;don&rsquo;t talk about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no heart, Joe,&rdquo; said Ronald
hotly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you make me
suffer. You don&rsquo;t know that this sort of thing
is enough to wreck a man&rsquo;s existence altogether.
You don&rsquo;t know what you are doing, because you
have no heart&ndash;not the least bit of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not say that&ndash;please do not,&rdquo; Joe
entreated, looking at him with imploring eyes, for
his words hurt her. Then suddenly the tears came in
a quick hot gush, and she hid her face in her hands.
&ldquo;Oh, Ronald, Ronald&ndash;it is you who do not know,&rdquo;
she sobbed.</p>

<p>Ronald did not quite know what to do; he never did
when Joe cried, but fortunately that disaster had
not occurred often since he was very small. He was
angry with himself for having disturbed and hurt her,
but he did not know what to do, most probably because
he did not really love her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; he said, looking at her in some
embarrassment, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Then he
rose and rather timidly laid a hand on her shoulder.
But she shrank from him with a petulant motion, and
the tears trickled through her small white hands and
fell upon her dark dress and on the &ldquo;Life of
Rufus Choate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe, dear&rdquo;&ndash;Ronald began again. And then,
in great uncertainty of mind, he went and looked out
of the window. Presently he came back and stood before
her once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am awfully sorry I said it, Joe. Please forgive
me. You don&rsquo;t often cry, you know, and so&rdquo;&ndash;He
hesitated.</p>

<p>Joe looked up at him with a smile through her tears,
beautiful as a rose just wet with a summer shower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so&ndash;you did not think I could,&rdquo; she
said. She dried her eyes quickly and rose to her feet.
&ldquo;It is very silly of me, I know, but I cannot
help it in the least,&rdquo; said she, turning from
him in pretense of arranging the knickknacks on the
mantel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you cannot help it, Joe, dear; as
if you had not a perfect right to cry, if you like!
I am such a brute&ndash;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and look at the snow,&rdquo; said Joe,
taking his hand and leading him to the window. Enormous
Irishmen in pilot coats, comforters, and india-rubber
boots, armed with broad wooden spades, were struggling
to keep the drifts from the pavement. Joe and Ronald
stood and watched them idly, absorbed in their own
thoughts.</p>

<p>Presently a booby sleigh drawn by a pair of strong
black horses floundered up the hill and stopped at
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ronald, there is Sybil, and she will see
I have been crying. You must  amuse her, and I will
come back in a few minutes.&rdquo; She turned and fled,
leaving Ronald at the window.</p>

<p>A footman sprang to the ground, and nearly lost his
footing in the snow as he opened a large umbrella
and rang the bell. In a moment Sybil was out of the
sleigh and at the door of the house; she could not
sit still till it was opened, although the flakes
were falling as thickly as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;&ndash;she exclaimed, as she entered the
room and was met by Ronald, &ldquo;I thought Joe was
here.&rdquo; There was color in her face, and she took
Ronald&rsquo;s hand cordially. He blushed to the eyes,
and stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thorn is&ndash;she&ndash;indeed, she will be back
in a moment. How do you do? Dreadful weather, is not
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is only a snowstorm,&rdquo; said Sybil,
brushing a few flakes from her furs as she came near
the fire. &ldquo;We do not mind it at all here. But
of course you never have snow in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not like this, certainly,&rdquo; said Ronald.
&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; he added, as Sybil
began to remove her cloak.</p>

<p>It was a very sudden change of company for Ronald;
five minutes ago he was trying, very clumsily and
hopelessly, to console Joe Thorn in her tears, feeling
angry enough with himself all the while for having
caused them. Now he was face to face with Sybil Brandon,
the most beautiful woman he remembered to have seen,
and she smiled at him as he took her heavy cloak from
her shoulders, and the touch of the fur sent a thrill
to his heart, and the blood to his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; he remarked, depositing
the things on a sofa, &ldquo;you are very courageous
to come out, even though you are used to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come yourself,&rdquo; said Sybil,
laughing a little. &ldquo;You told me last night that
you did not come here every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;I told my cousin I had come because I was
so lonely at the hotel. It is amazingly dull to sit
all day in a close room, reading stupid novels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it would be. Have you nothing
else to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing in the wide world,&rdquo; said Ronald
with a smile. &ldquo;What should I do here, in a strange
place, where I know so few people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is not much for a man to do,
unless he is in business. Every one here is in some
kind of business, you know, so they are never bored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald wished he could say the right thing to reestablish
the half-intimacy he had felt when talking to Sybil
the night before. But it was not easy to get back
to the same point. There was an interval of hours
between yesterday and to-day&ndash;and there was Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I read novels to pass the time,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and because they are sometimes so like one&rsquo;s
own life. But when they are not, they bore me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil was fond of reading, and she was especially
fond of fiction, not because she cared for sensational
interests, but because she was naturally contemplative,
and it interested her to read about the human nature
of the present, rather than to learn what any individual
historian thought of the human nature of the past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of novels do you like best?&rdquo;
she asked, sitting down to pass the time with Ronald
until Josephine should make her appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like love stories best,&rdquo; said Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Sybil gravely, &ldquo;so
do I. But what kind do you like best? The sad ones,
or those that end well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like them to end well,&rdquo; said Ronald,
&ldquo;because the best ones never do, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never?&rdquo; There was something in Sybil&rsquo;s
tone that made Ronald look quickly at her. She said
the word as though she, too, had something to regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in my experience,&rdquo; answered Surbiton,
with the decision of a man past loving or being loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dreadfully gloomy! One would think you
had done with life, Mr. Surbiton,&rdquo; said Sybil,
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think so, Miss Brandon,&rdquo;
answered Ronald in solemn tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we all think it would be nice to
die, sometimes. But then the next morning things look
so much brighter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they often look much brighter in the
evening,&rdquo; said Ronald, thinking of the night
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure something disagreeable has happened
to you to-day, Mr. Surbiton,&rdquo; said Sybil, looking
at him. Ronald looked into her eyes as though to see
if there were any sympathy there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, something disagreeable has happened to
me,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;Something very
disagreeable and painful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Sybil simply. But her
voice sounded very kind and comforting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is why I say that love stories always
end badly in real life,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;But
I suppose I ought not to complain.&rdquo; It was not
until he had thought over this speech, some minutes
later, that he realized that in a few words he had
told Sybil the main part of his troubles. He never
guessed that she was so far in Joe&rsquo;s confidence
as to have heard the whole story before. But Sybil
was silent and thoughtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love is such an uncertain thing,&rdquo; she
began, after a pause; and it chanced that at that
very moment Joe opened the door and entered the room.
She caught the sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are instructing my cousin,&rdquo; she
said to Sybil, laughing. &ldquo;I approve of the way
you spend your time, my children!&rdquo; No one would
have believed that, twenty minutes earlier, Joe had
been in tears. She was as fresh and as gay as ever,
and Ronald said to himself that she most certainly
had no heart, but that Sybil had a great deal,&ndash;he
was sure of it from the tone of her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the news about the election, Sybil?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;Of course you know all about it
at the Wyndhams&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, the family politics are in a state
of confusion that is simply too delightful,&rdquo;
said Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know it is said that Ira C. Calvin has
refused to be a candidate, and the Republicans mean
to put in Mr. Jobbins in his place, who is such a
popular man, and so good and benevolent-quite a philanthropist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it make very much difference?&rdquo; asked
Joe anxiously. &ldquo;I wish I understood all about
it, but the local names are so hard to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you bad been learning them all the
morning in Choate,&rdquo; put in Ronald, who perceived
that the conversation was to be about Harrington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does make a difference,&rdquo; said Sybil,
not noticing Ronald&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;because
Jobbins is much more popular than Calvin, and they
say he is a friend of Patrick Ballymolloy, who will
win the election for either side he favors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this Irishman?&rdquo; inquired Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the chief Irishman,&rdquo; said Sybil
laughing, &ldquo;and I cannot describe him any better.
He has twenty votes with him, and as things stand he
always carries whichever point he favors. But Mr. Wyndham
says he is glad he is not in the Legislature, because
it would drive him out of his mind to decide on which
side to vote&ndash;though he is a good Republican, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he could vote for Mr. Harrington
in spite of that,&rdquo; said Joe, confidently. &ldquo;Anybody
would, who knows him, I am sure. But when is the election
to come off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say it is to begin to-day,&rdquo; said
Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall never hear anything unless we go to
Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Aunt
Zo&euml; is awfully clever, and that, but she never knows
in the least what is going on. She says she does not
understand politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were a Bostonian, Mr. Surbiton,&rdquo;
said Sybil, &ldquo;you would get into the State House
and hear the earliest news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do anything in the world to oblige you,&rdquo;
said Ronald gravely, &ldquo;if you will only explain
a little&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! It is quite impossible. Come with me,
both of you, and we will get some lunch at the Wyndhams&rsquo;
and hear all about it by telephone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;One moment,
while I get my things.&rdquo; She left the room. Ronald
and Sybil were again alone together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were saying when my cousin came in, that
love was a very uncertain thing,&rdquo; suggested
Ronald, rather timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was I?&rdquo; said Sybil, standing before the
mirror above the mantelpiece, and touching her hat
first on one side and then on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ronald, watching her.
&ldquo;Do you know, I have often thought so too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be something different if
it were quite certain. Perhaps it would be something
much less interesting, but much better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are a little confused, Mr. Surbiton,&rdquo;
said Sybil, and as she smiled, Ronald could see her
face reflected in the mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;yes&ndash;that is&ndash;I dare say I am,&rdquo; said
he, hesitatingly. &ldquo;But I know exactly what I
mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you know exactly what you want?&rdquo;
she asked with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed,&rdquo; said he confidently. &ldquo;But
I do not believe I shall ever get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that is the &lsquo;disagreeable and painful
thing&rsquo; you referred to, as having happened this
morning, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked Sybil, calmly,
as she turned to take up her cloak which lay on the
sofa. Ronald blushed scarlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;yes,&rdquo; he said, forgetting in his
embarrassment to help her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so heavy,&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;Thanks.
Do you know that you have been making confidences
to me, Mr. Surbiton?&rdquo; she asked, turning and
facing him, with a half-amused, half-serious look
in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have,&rdquo; he answered, after
a short pause. &ldquo;You must think I am very foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she said gravely. &ldquo;They
are safe with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Ronald in a low voice.</p>

<p>Josephine entered the room, clad in many furs, and
a few minutes later all three were on their way to
Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s, the big booby sleigh rocking
and leaping and ploughing in the heavy dry snow.</p>

<h1>Chapter XV.</h1>

<p>Pocock Vancouver was also abroad in the snowstorm.
He would not in any case have stayed at home on account
of the weather, but on this particular morning he
had very urgent business with a gentleman who, like
Lamb, rose with the lark, though he did not go to
bed with the chickens. There are no larks in Boston,
but the scream of the locomotives answers nearly as
well.</p>

<p>Vancouver accordingly had himself driven at an early
hour to a certain house not situated in the West End,
but of stone quite as brown, and having a bay window
as prominent as any sixteen-foot-front on Beacon Street;
those advantages, however, did not prevent Mr. Vancouver
from wearing an expression of fastidious scorn as
he mounted the steps and pulled the polished German
silver handle of the door-bell. The curl on his lip
gave way to a smile of joyous cordiality as he was
ushered into the presence of the owner of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m glad to see you, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo;
said his host, whose extremely Celtic appearance was
not belied by unctuous modulation of his voice, and
the pleasant roll of his softly aspirated consonants.</p>

<p>This great man was no other than Mr. Patrick Ballymolloy.
He received Vancouver in his study, which was handsomely
furnished with bright green wall-paper, a sideboard
on which stood a number of decanters and glasses,
several leather easy-chairs, and a green china spittoon.</p>

<p>In personal appearance, Mr. Patrick Ballymolloy was
vastly more striking than attractive. He was both
corpulent and truculent, and his hands and feet were
of a size and thickness calculated to crush a paving-stone
at a step, or to fell an ox at a blow. The nails of
his fingers were of a hue which is made artificially
fashionable in eastern countries, but which excites
prejudice in western civilization from an undue display
of real estate. A neck which the Minotaur might have
justly envied surmounted the thickness and roundness
of Mr. Ballymolloy&rsquo;s shoulders, and supported
a head more remarkable for the immense cavity of the
mouth, and for a quantity of highly pomaded sandy
hair, than for any intellectuality of the brows or
high-bred fineness of the nose. Mr. Ballymolloy&rsquo;s
nose was nevertheless an astonishing feature, and
at a distance called vividly to mind the effect of
one of those great glass bottles of reddened water,
behind which apothecaries of all degrees put a lamp
at dusk in order that their light may the better shine
in the darkness. It was one of the most surprising
feats of nature&rsquo;s alchemy that a liquid so brown
as that contained in the decanters on Patrick&rsquo;s
sideboard should be able to produce and maintain anything
so supernaturally red as Patrick&rsquo;s nose.</p>

<p>Mr. Ballymolloy was clad in a beautiful suit of shiny
black broadcloth, and the front of his coat was irregularly
but richly adorned with a profusion of grease-spots
of all sizes. A delicate suggestive mezzotint shaded
the edges of his collar and cuffs, and from his heavy
gold watch-chain depended a malachite seal of unusual
greenness and brilliancy.</p>

<p>Vancouver took the gigantic outstretched hand of his
host in his delicate fingers, with an air of cordiality
which, if not genuine, was very well assumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, sir,&rdquo; said
the Irishman again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Vancouver, &ldquo;and I
am fortunate in finding you at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ballymolloy smiled, and pushed one of his leather
easy-chairs towards the fire. Both men sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are pretty busy over this election,
Mr. Ballymolloy,&rdquo; said Vancouver; blandly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s just it, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo;
replied the Irishman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just exactly
what&rsquo;s the matter with me, for indeed I am very
busy, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so, Mr. Ballymolloy. Especially since
the change last night. I remember what a good friend
you have always been to Mr. Jobbins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as you say, Mr. Vancouver, I have been
thinking that I and Mr. Jobbins are pretty good friends,
and that&rsquo;s just about what it is, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember that on more than one occasion
you and he have acted together in the affairs of the
state,&rdquo; said Vancouver, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&rsquo;"Ah, but it&rsquo;s the soul of him that I
like,&rdquo; answered Mr. Ballymolloy very sweetly.
&ldquo;He has such a beautiful soul, Mr. Jobbins; it
does me good, and indeed it does, Mr. Vancouver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, sir, a man full of broad human
sympathies. Nevertheless I feel sure that on the present
occasion your political interests will lead you to
follow the promptings of duty, and to vote in favor
of the Democratic candidate. I wish you and I did
not differ in politics, Mr. Ballymolloy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, indeed, there is not so very much difference,
if it comes to that, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo; replied
Patrick in conciliating tones. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
just what I have been thinking, that I will vote for
Mr. Harrington. It&rsquo;s a matter of principle with
me, Mr. Vancouver, and that&rsquo;s it exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where should we all be without principles,
Mr. Ballymolloy? Indeed I may say that the importance
of principles in political matters is very great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s just the greatest pity in the
world that every one has not  principles like you,
Mr. Vancouver. I&rsquo;m speaking the truth now.&rdquo;
According to Mr. Patrick Ballymolloy&rsquo;s view
of destiny, it was the truth and nothing but the truth.
He knew Vancouver of old, and Vancouver knew him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You flatter me, sir,&rdquo; said Pocock, affecting
a pleased smile. &ldquo;To tell the truth, there is
a little matter I wanted to speak to you about, if
you can spare me half an hour.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m most entirely delighted to
be at your service, Mr. Vancouver, and I&rsquo;m glad
you came so early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is, Mr. Ballymolloy, we are thinking
of making an extension on one of our lines; a small
matter, but of importance to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it must be the branch of the Pocahontas
and Dead Man&rsquo;s Valley you&rsquo;ll be speaking
of, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo; said the Irishman, with sudden
and cheerful interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Mr. Ballymolloy, you are a man of the
most surprising quickness. It is a real pleasure to
talk with you on such matters. I have no doubt you
understand the whole question thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s of no use at all to say I
know nothing about it, because I <i>have</i>
heard it mentioned, and that&rsquo;s the plain truth,
Mr. Vancouver. And it will take a deal of rail, too,
and that&rsquo;s another thing. And where do you think
of getting the iron from, Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I had hoped, Mr. Ballmolly,&rdquo; said
Vancouver, with some affected hesitation, &ldquo;that
as an old friend, we might be able to manage matters
with you. But, of course, this is entirely unofficial,
and between ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ballymolloy nodded with something very like a
wink of one bloodshot eye. He knew what he was about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when will you be thinking of beginning
the work, Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo; he inquired, after
a short pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just the question, or rather, perhaps,
I should say the difficulty. We do not expect to begin
work for a year or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And surely that makes no difference, then,
at all,&rdquo; returned Patrick. &ldquo;For the longer
the time, the easier it will be for me to accommodate
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;but you see, Mr. Ballymolloy, it may be
that in a year&rsquo;s time these new-fangled ideas
about free trade may be law, and it may be much cheaper
for us to get our rails from England, as Mr. Vanderbilt
did three or four years ago, when he was in such a
hurry, you remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, indeed, I remember it very well, Mr. Vancouver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. Now you see, Mr. Ballymolloy, I am
speaking to you entirely as a friend, though I hope
I may before long bring about an official agreement.
But you see the difficulty of making a contract a year
ahead, when a party of Democratic senators and Congressmen
may by that time have upset the duty on steel rails,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And indeed, I see it as plain as day, Mr. Vancouver.
And that&rsquo;s why I was saying I wished every one
had such principles as yourself, and I&rsquo;m telling
you no lie when I say it again.&rdquo; Verily Mr. Ballymolloy
was a truthful person!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. Now, do not you think, Mr. Ballymolloy,
that all this talk about free trade is great nonsense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, surely, it will be the ruin of the whole
country, Mr. Vancouver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, free trade has nothing to do with
Democratic principles, has it? You see here am I,
the best Republican in Massachusetts, and here are
you, the best Democrat in the country, and we both
agree in saying that it is great nonsense to leave
iron unprotected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s the principle of you I like,
Mr. Vancouver!&rdquo; exclaimed Ballymolloy in great
admiration. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your principles are beautiful,
just!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir. Now of course you are going
to vote for Mr. Harrington to-day, or to-morrow, or
whenever the election is to be. Don&rsquo;t you think
yon might say something to him that would be of some
use? I believe he is very uncertain about protection,
you see. I think you could persuade him, somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, Mr. Vancouver, it&rsquo;s the truth
when I tell you I was just thinking of speaking to
him about it, just a little, before I went up to the
State House. And indeed I&rsquo;ll be going to him
immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is the wisest plan,&rdquo; said
Vancouver, rising to go, &ldquo;and we will speak
about the contract next week, when all this election
business is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, and indeed, I hope it will be soon, sir,&rdquo;
said Ballymolloy. &ldquo;But  you&rsquo;ll not think
of going out again in the snow without taking a drop
of something, will you, Mr. Vancouver?&rdquo; He went
to the sideboard and poured out two stiff doses of
the amber liquid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you are so kind,&rdquo; said Vancouver,
graciously taking the proffered glass. He knew better
than to refuse to drink over a bargain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And luck to yourself, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo;
said Ballymolloy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you can persuade him, somehow,&rdquo;
said Vancouver, as his host opened the street-door
for him to go out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, indeed, I think so too,&rdquo; said Ballymolloy.
Then he went back to his study and poured out a second
glass of whiskey. &ldquo;And if I cannot persuade
him,&rdquo; he continued in soliloquy, &ldquo;why,
then, it will just be old Jobbins  who will be senator,
and that&rsquo;s the plain truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vancouver went away with a light heart, and the frank
smile on his delicate features was most pleasant to
see. He knew John Harrington well, and he was certain
that Mr. Ballymolloy&rsquo;s proposal would rouse the
honest wrath of the man he detested.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mr. Ballymolloy entered Harrington&rsquo;s
room in Charles Street. John was seated at the table,
fully dressed, and writing letters. He offered his
visitor a seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the election is coming on right away, Mr.
Harrington,&rdquo; began Patrick, making himself comfortable,
and lighting one of John&rsquo;s cigars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I hear, Mr. Ballymolloy,&rdquo; answered
John with a pleasant smile. &ldquo;I hope I may count
on you, in spite of what you said yesterday. These
are the times when men must keep together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Mr. Harrington, you&rsquo;ll not believe
that I could go to the House and vote against my own
party, surely, will you now?&rdquo; said Patrick. But
there was a tinge of irony in his soft tones. He knew
that Vancouver could make him great and advantageous
business transactions, and he treated him accordingly.
John Harrington was, on the other hand, a mere candidate
for his twenty votes; he could make John senator if
he chose, or defeat him, if he preferred it, and he
accordingly behaved to John with an air of benevolent
superiority.  &ldquo;I trust you would do no such thing,
Mr. Ballymolloy,&rdquo; said John gravely. &ldquo;Without
advocating myself as in any way fit for the honors
of the Senate, I can say that it is of the utmost
importance that we should have as many Democrats in
Congress as possible, in the Senate as well as in
the House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t think I doubt that,
Mr. Harrington? And indeed the Senate is pretty well
Democratic as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John, smiling, &ldquo;but
the more the better, I should think. It is a very
different matter from the local legislature, where
changes may often do good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed and it is, Mr. Harrington. And will
you please to tell me what you will do about free
trade, when you&rsquo;re in the Senate, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I cannot tell you anything that
I did not tell you yesterday, Mr. Ballymolloy. I am
a tariff reform man. It is a great Democratic movement,
and I should be bound to support it, even if I were
not myself so thorough a believer in it as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see here, Mr. Harrington, it&rsquo;s the
gospel truth I&rsquo;m telling you, when I say you&rsquo;re
mistaken. Here are plenty of us Democrats who don&rsquo;t
want the least little bit of free trade. I&rsquo;m
in the iron business, Mr. Harrington, and you won&rsquo;t
be after thinking me such an all-powerful galoot as
to cut my own nose off, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; said John, who was
used to many peculiarities of language in his visitors.
&ldquo;But, of course, iron will be the thing last
on the tariff. I am of opinion that it is necessary
to put enough tax on iron to protect home-producers
at the time of greatest depression. That is fair,
is not it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you may think so, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo;
said Ballymolloy, knocking the ashes from his cigar.
&ldquo;But you are not an iron man, now, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;But
I have studied the question, and I know its importance.
In a reformation of the tariff, iron would be one of
the things most carefully provided for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know all that,&rdquo; said Ballymolloy,
somewhat roughly, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s not much
you can tell me about tariff reform that I don&rsquo;t
know, neither. And when you have reformed other things,
you&rsquo;ll be for reforming iron, too, just to keep
your hands in. And, indeed, I&rsquo;ve no objection
whatever to your reforming everything you like, so
long as you don&rsquo;t interfere with me and mine.
But I don&rsquo;t trust the principles of the thing,
sir; I don&rsquo;t trust them the least little bit,
and for me I would rather there were not to be any
reforming at all, except for the Chinamen, and I don&rsquo;t
care much for them, neither, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Mr. Ballymolloy. Every man has a
right to his free opinion. But we stand on the reform
platform, for there is no country in the world where
reform is more needed than it is here. I can only repeat
that the interests of the iron trade stand high with
the Democratic party, and that it is highly improbable
that any law will interfere with iron for many years.
I cannot say more than that and yet stick to facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always stick to facts, Mr. Harrington. You
will find the truth a very important thing indeed,
and good principles too, in dealing with plain-spoken
men like myself, sir. Stick to the truth, Mr. Harrington,
forever and ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I propose to, Mr. Ballymolloy,&rdquo; answered
John, internally amused at the solemn manner of his
interlocutor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then I will put the matter to you, Mr.
Harrington, and indeed it&rsquo;s a  plain matter,
too, and not the least taste of dishonesty in it, at
all. I&rsquo;ve been thinking I&rsquo;d make you senator
if you&rsquo;ll agree to go against free trade, and
that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ll do, and no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to make such a bargain,
Mr. Ballymolloy. After your exposition of the importance
of truth I am surprised that you should expect me
to belie my whole political life. As I have told you,
I am prepared to support laws to protect iron as much
as is necessary. Free trade nowadays does not mean
cutting away all duties; it means a proper adjustment
of them to the requirements of our commerce. A proper
adjustment of duties could not possibly be interpreted
to mean any injury to the iron trade. You may rely
upon that, at all events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, and I&rsquo;m sure I can,&rdquo; said Ballymolloy
incredulously, and he grew, if possible, redder in
the face than nature and the action of alcohol had
made him. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not only sure of it,
but I&rsquo;ll swear it&rsquo;s gospel truth. But
then, you know, I&rsquo;m of opinion that by the time
you&rsquo;ve done reforming the other things, the
reformed gentlemen won&rsquo;t like it, and then they&rsquo;ll
just turn round and eat you up unless you reform us
too, and that just means the ruin of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come now, Mr. Ballymolloy, that is exaggeration,&rdquo;
said John. &ldquo;If you will listen to me for a moment&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got the time, sir, and that&rsquo;s
all about it. If you&rsquo;ll protect our interests
and promise to do it, you&rsquo;ll be senator. The
election is coming on, Mr. Harrington, and I&rsquo;d
be sorry to see you thrown out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ballymolloy, I had sincerely hoped that
you would support me in this matter, but I must tell
you once more that I think you are unreasonable. I
vouch for the sufficient protection of your interests,
because it is the belief of our party that they need
protection. But it is not necessary for you to have
an anti-reform senator for that purpose, in the first
place; and secondly, the offer of a seat in the Senate
would never induce me to change my mind, nor to turn
round and deny everything that I have said and written
on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that is your last word of all, Mr. Harrington?&rdquo;
said Ballymolloy, heaving his heavy body out of the
easy-chair. But his voice, which had sounded somewhat
irate during the discussion, again rolled out in mellifluous
tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Ballymolloy, that is all I have to
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And indeed it&rsquo;s not so very bad at all,&rdquo;
said Patrick. &ldquo;You see I just wanted to see
how far you were likely to go, because, though I&rsquo;m
a good Democrat, sir, I&rsquo;m against free trade
in the main points, and that&rsquo;s just the truth.
But if you say you will stand up for iron right through,
and use your best judgment, why, I guess you&rsquo;ll
have to be senator after all. It&rsquo;s a great position,
Mr. Harrington, and I hope you&rsquo;ll do honor to
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so, indeed,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Can
I offer you a glass of wine, or anything else, Mr.
Ballymolloy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and it&rsquo;s dirty weather, too,&rdquo;
said Patrick. &ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;ll take a
little whiskey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John poured out a glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let me drink alone, Mr. Harrington?&rdquo;
inquired Patrick, holding his tumbler in his hand.
To oblige him, after the manner of the country, John
poured out a small glass of sherry, and put his lips
to it. Ballymolloy drained the whiskey to the last
drop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not really thinking I would vote for
Mr. Jobbins, were you now, Mr. Harrington?&rdquo;
he asked, with a sly look on his red face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always hope that the men of my party are
to be relied upon, Mr. Ballymolloy,&rdquo; said John,
smiling politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, they are to be relied upon, sir.
We are, every man of us, to the last drop of Christian
blood in our blessed bodies,&rdquo; said Patrick,
with a gush of patriotic enthusiasm, at the same time
holding out his heavy hand. Then he took his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better have said &rsquo;to the last
drop of Bourbon whiskey in the blessed bottle!&rsquo;&rdquo;
said John to himself when his visitor was gone. Then
he sat down for a while to think over the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man will vote against me yet,&rdquo; he
thought.</p>

<p>He was astonished to find himself nervous and excited
for the first time in his life. With characteristic
determination he went back to his desk, and continued
the letter which the visit of the Irish elector had
interrupted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Patrick Ballymolloy was driven to the
house of the Republican candidate, Mr. Jobbing.</p>

<h1>Chapter XVI.</h1>

<p>Sybil was right when she said the family politics
at the Wyndhams&rsquo; were disturbed. Indeed the
disturbance was so great that Mrs. Wyndham was dressed
and down-stairs before twelve o&rsquo;clock, which
had never before occurred in the memory of the oldest
servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too perfectly exciting, my dears,&rdquo;
she exclaimed as Joe and Sybil entered the room, followed&ndash;at
a respectful distance by Ronald. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
stand it one minute longer! How do you do, Mr. Surbiton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the latest news?&rdquo; asked Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not heard anything for ever so long.
Sam has gone round to see&ndash; perhaps he will be back
soon. I do wish we had &lsquo;tickers&rsquo; here in
the house, as they do in New York; it <i>is</i>
such fun watching when anything is going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She walked about the room as she talked, touching
a book on one table and a photograph on another, in
a state of great excitement. Ronald watched her in
some surprise; it seemed odd to him that any one should
take so much interest in a mere election. Joe and
Sybil, who knew her better, made themselves at home.</p>

<p>It appeared that although Sam had gone to make inquiries,
it was very improbable that anything would be known
until late in the afternoon. There was to be a contest
of some sort, but whether it would end in a single
day, or whether Ballymolloy and his men intended to
prolong the struggle for their own ends, remained
to be seen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Wyndham walked about her drawing-room
descanting upon the iniquities of political life,
with an animation that delighted Joe and amused Ronald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there is nothing for it, you see,&rdquo;
she said at last. &ldquo;Sam evidently does not mean
to come home, and you must just stay here and have
some lunch until he does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three agreed, nothing loath to enjoying one another&rsquo;s
company. There is nothing like a day spent together
in waiting for an event, to bring out the characteristics
of individuals. Mrs. Wyndham fretted and talked, and
fretted again. Joe grew silent, pale, and anxious as
the morning passed, while Sybil and Ronald seemed
to enjoy themselves extremely, and talked without
ceasing. Outside the snow fell thick and fast as ever,
and the drifts rose higher and higher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish Sam would come back,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Wyndham at last, as she threw herself into an
easy-chair, and looked at the clock.</p>

<p>But Sam did not come, nevertheless, and Joe sat quietly
by the fire, wishing she were alone, and yet unwilling
to leave the house where she hoped to have the earliest
information.</p>

<p>The two who seemed rapidly growing indifferent to
the issue of the election were Sybil and Ronald, who
sat together with a huge portfolio of photographs
and sketches between them, laughing and talking pleasantly
enough. Joe did not hear a word of their conversation,
and Mrs. Wyndham paid little attention to it, though
her practiced ears could have heard it all if need
be, while she herself was profoundly occupied with
some one else.</p>

<p>The four had a somewhat dreary meal together, and
Ronald was told to go into Sam&rsquo;s study and smoke
if he liked, while Mrs. Wyndham led Joe and Sybil
away to look at a quantity of new things that had just
come from Paris. Ronald did as he was bid and settled
himself for an hour, with a plentiful supply of newspapers
and railroad literature.</p>

<p>It was past three o&rsquo;clock when Sam Wyndham entered
the room, his face wet with the snowflakes and red
with excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo; he exclaimed, seeing Ronald comfortably
ensconced in his favorite easy-chair. &ldquo;How are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Ronald, rising quickly.
&ldquo;They told me to come in here after lunch, and
so I was waiting until I was sent for, or told to come
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very glad to see you, any way,&rdquo; said
Sam cordially. &ldquo;Well, I have been to hear about
an election&ndash;a friend of ours got put up for senator.
But I don&rsquo;t expect that interests you much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Ronald, &ldquo;I
have heard it so much talked of that I am as much
interested as anybody. Is it all over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, and a pretty queer business it was.
Well, our friend is not elected, anyway&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Harrington been defeated?&rdquo; asked
Ronald quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief he has been sold,&rdquo;
said Sam. &ldquo;But as I am a Republican myself and
a friend of Jobbins, more or less, I don&rsquo;t suppose
I feel so very bad about it, after all. But I don&rsquo;t
know how my wife will take it, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
said Sam presently. &ldquo;I expect we had better go
and tell her, right off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he has really lost the election?&rdquo;
inquired Ronald, who was not altogether sorry to hear
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes&ndash;as I say, Jobbins is senator now.
I should not wonder if Harrington were a good deal
cut up. Come along with me, now, and we will tell
the ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three ladies were in the drawing-room. Mrs. Wyndham
and Joe sprang to their feet as Sam and Ronald entered,
but Sybil remained seated and merely looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh now, Sam,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wyndham, in
great excitement, &ldquo;tell us all about it right
away. We are dying to know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe came close to Mrs. Wyndham, her face very pale
and her teeth clenched in her great anxiety. Sam threw
back the lapels of his coat, put his thumbs in the
armholes of his broad waistcoat, and turned his head
slightly on one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;John&rsquo;s
wiped out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say he has lost the election?&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Wyndham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;he&rsquo;s lost it. Jobbins is senator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam, you are perfectly horrid!&rdquo; exclaimed
his spouse, in deepest vexation.</p>

<p>Josephine Thorn spoke no word, but turned away and
went alone to the window. She was deathly pale, and
she trembled from head to foot as she clutched the
heavy curtain with her small white fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Harrington!&rdquo; said Sybil thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I am dreadfully sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wyndham and Ronald moved toward the fire
where Sybil was sitting. No one spoke for a few seconds.
At last Mrs. Wyndham broke out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sam, it&rsquo;s a perfect shame!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I think all those people ought to be
locked up for bribery. I am certain it was all done
by some horrid stealing, or something, now, was not
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, my dear,&rdquo;
said Sam reflectively. &ldquo;You see they generally
vote fair enough in these things. Well, may be that
fellow Ballymolloy has made something out of it. He&rsquo;s
a pretty bad sort of a scamp, any way, I expect. Sorry
you are so put out about it, but Jobbins is not so
very bad, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil suddenly missed Joe from the group, and looked
across to where she stood by the window. A glance
told her that something was wrong, and she rose from
her seat and went to her friend. The sight of Josephine&rsquo;s
pale face frightened her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joe, dear,&rdquo; she said affectionately,
&ldquo;you are ill&ndash;come to my room.&rdquo; Sybil
put one arm round her waist and quietly led her away.
Ronald had watched the little scene from a distance,
but Mr. and Mrs. Wyndham continued to discuss the
result of the election.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is exactly like you, Sam, to be talking
in that way, instead of telling me just how it happened,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Wyndham. &ldquo;And then to say it is not
so very bad after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will tell you all about it right away,
my dear, if you&rsquo;ll only give me a little time.
You&rsquo;re always in such an immense fever about
everything that it&rsquo;s perfectly impossible to
get along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to begin?&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham,
half vexed with her husband&rsquo;s deliberate indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as near as I can make out it was generally
thought at the start that John had a pretty good show.
The Senate elected him right away by a majority of
four, which was so much to the good, for of course
his friends reckoned on getting him in, if the Senate
hadn&rsquo;t elected him, by the bigger majority of
the House swamping the Senate in the General Court.
But it&rsquo;s gone just the other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the General Court?&rdquo; asked
Ronald, much puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the General Court is when the House and
the Senate meet together next day to formally declare
a senator elected, if they have both chosen the same
man, or to elect one by a general majority if they
haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is it,&rdquo; added Mrs. Wyndham
to Ronald, and then addressing her husband, &ldquo;Do
go on, Sam; you&rsquo;ve not told us anything yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as I said, the Senate elected John Harrington
by a majority of four. The House took a long time
getting to work, and then there was some mistake about
the first vote, so they had to take a second. And when
that was done Jobbins actually had a majority of eighteen.
So John&rsquo;s beaten, and Jobbins will be senator
anyhow, and you must just make the best you can out
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought you said when the House and the
Senate did not agree, the General Court met next day
and elected a senator?&rdquo; asked Ronald again;
&ldquo;and in that case Mr. Harrington is not really
beaten yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, theoretically he&rsquo;s not,&rdquo;
said Sam, &ldquo;because of course Jobbins is  not
actually senator until he has been elected by the General
Court, but the majority for him in the House was so
surprisingly large, and the majority for John so small
in the Senate, and the House is so much larger than
the Senate, that the vote to-morrow is a dead sure
thing, and Jobbins is just as much senator as if he
were sitting in Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will expect me to have Mr. Jobbins
to dinner, now. I think the whole business is perfectly
mean!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me, my dear,&rdquo; said
Sam calmly. &ldquo;I did not create the Massachusetts
Legislature, and I did not found the State House, nor
discover America, nor any of these things. And after
all, Jobbins is a very respectable man and belongs
to our own party, while Harrington does  not. When
I set up creating I&rsquo;ll make a note of one or
two points, and I&rsquo;ll see that John is properly
attended to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not be silly, Sam,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wyndham. &ldquo;What has become of those girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They went out of the room some time ago,&rdquo;
said Ronald, who had been listening with much amusement
to the description of the election. He was never quite
sure whether people could be serious when they talked
such peculiar language, and he observed with surprise
that Mr. and Mrs. Wyndham talked to each other in
phrases very different from those they used in addressing
himself.</p>

<p>Sybil had led Joe away to her room. She did not guess
the cause of Joe&rsquo;s faintness, but supposed it
to be a momentary indisposition, amenable to the effects
of eau-de-cologne. She made her lie upon the great
cretonne sofa, moistening her forehead, and giving
her a bottle of salts to smell.</p>

<p>But Joe, who had never been ill in her life, recovered
her strength in a few minutes, and regaining her feet
began to walk about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think it was, Joe, dear?&rdquo;
asked Sybil, watching her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was nothing. Perhaps the room was hot,
and I was tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you looked tired all the morning,&rdquo;
said Sybil, &ldquo;and just when I looked at you I
thought you were going to faint. You were as pale as
death, and you seemed holding yourself up by the curtains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Joe, trying to laugh. &ldquo;How
silly of me! I felt faint for a moment&ndash;that was all.
I think I will go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear&ndash;but stay a few minutes longer and
rest yourself. I will order a carriage&ndash;it is still
snowing hard.&rdquo; Sybil left the room.</p>

<p>Once alone, Joe threw herself upon the sofa again.
She would rather have died than have told any one,
even Sybil Brandon, that it was no sickness she felt,
but only a great and overwhelming disappointment for
the man she loved.</p>

<p>Her love was doubly hers&ndash;her very own&ndash;in that it
was fast locked in her own heart, beyond the reach
of any human being to know. Of all that came and went
about her, and flattered her, and strove for her graces,
not one suspected that she loved a man in their very
midst, passionately, fervently, with all the strength
she had. Ronald&rsquo;s suspicions were too vague,
and too much the result of a preconceived idea, to
represent anything like a certainty to himself, and
he had not mentioned them to her.</p>

<p>If anything can determine the passion of love in a
woman, it is the great flood of sympathy that overflows
her heart when the man she loves is hurt, or overcome
in a great cause. When, for a little moment, that which
she thinks strongest and bravest and most manly is
struck down and wounded and brought low, her love
rises up and is strong within her, and makes her more
noble in the devotion of perfect gentleness than a
man can ever be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if only he could have won!&rdquo; Joe said
again and again to herself. &ldquo;If only he could
have won, I would have given anything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil came back in a few moments, and saw Joe lying
down, still white and apparently far from well. She
knelt upon the floor by her side and taking her hands,
looked affectionately into her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something the matter,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I know&ndash;you cannot deceive me &ndash;there is something
serious the matter. Will you tell me, Joe? Can I do
anything at all to help you?&rdquo; Joe smiled faintly,
grateful for the sympathy and for the gentle words
of her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Sybil dear. It is nothing&ndash;there is nothing
you can do. Thanks, dearest&ndash;I shall be very well
in a little while. It is nothing, really. Is the carriage
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Joe and Ronald were again at
Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s house. Joe recovered her
self-control on the way, and asked Ronald to come
in, an invitation which he cheerfully accepted.</p>

<p>John Harrington had spent the day in a state of anxiety
which was new to him. Enthusiastic by nature, he was
calm by habit, and he was surprised to find his hand
unsteady and his brain not capable of the intense
application he could usually command. Ten minutes after
the results of the election were known at the State
House, he received a note from a friend informing
him with expressions of hearty sympathy how the day
had gone.</p>

<p>The strong physical sense of pain which accompanies
all great disappointments, took hold of him, and he
fell back in his seat and closed his eyes, his teeth
set and his face pale with the suffering, while his
broad hands convulsively grasped the heavy oaken arms
of his chair.</p>

<p>It may be that this same bodily agony, which is of
itself but the gross reflection in our material selves
of what the soul is bearing, is a wholesome provision
that draws our finer senses away from looking at what
might blind them altogether. There are times when a
man would go mad if his mind were not detached from
its sorrow by the quick, sharp beating of his bodily
heart, and by the keen torture of the physical body,
that is like the thrusting of a red-hot knife between
breastbone and midriff.</p>

<p>The expression &ldquo;self-control&rdquo; is daily
in the blatant mouths of preachers and moralists,
the very cant of emptiness and folly. It means nothing,
nor can any play of words or cunning twisting of conception
ever give it meaning. For the &ldquo;self&rdquo; is
the divine, imperishable portion of the eternal God
which is in man. I may control my limbs and the strength
that is in them, and I may force under the appetites
and passions of this mortal body, but I cannot myself,
for it is myself that controls, being of nature godlike
and stronger than all which is material. And although,
for an infinitely brief space of time, I myself may
inhabit and give life to this handful of most changeable
atoms, I have it in my supreme power and choice to
make them act according to my pleasure. If I become
enamored of the body and its ways, and of the subtleties
of a fleeting bodily intelligence, I have forgotten
to control those things; and having forgotten that
I have free will given me from heaven to rule what
is mine, I am no longer a man, but a beast. But while
I, who am an immortal soul, command the perishable
engine in which I dwell, I am in truth a man. For
the soul is of God and forever, whereas the body is
a thing of to-day that vanishes into dust to-morrow;
but the two together are the living man. And thus
it is that God is made man in us every day.</p>

<p>All that which we know by our senses is but an illusion.
What is true of its own nature, we can neither see,
nor hear, nor feel, nor taste. It is a matter of time,
and nothing more, and whatever palpable thing a man
can name will inevitably be dissolved into its constituent
parts, that these may again agglomerate into a new
illusion for future ages. But that which is subject
to no change, nor disintegration, nor reconstruction,
is the immortal truth, to attain to a knowledge and
understanding of which is to be saved from the endless
shifting of the material and illusory universe.</p>

<p>John Harrington lay in his chair alone in his rooms,
while the snow whirled against the windows outside
and made little drifts on the sills. The fire had
gone out and the bitter storm beat against the casements
and howled in the chimney, and the dusk of the night
began to mingle with the thick white flakes, and brought
upon the solitary man a great gloom and horror of
loneliness. It seemed to him that his life was done,
and his strength gone from him. He had labored in
vain for years, for this end, and he had failed to
attain it. It were better to have died than to suffer
 the ignominy of this defeat. It were better never
to have lived at all than to have lived so utterly
in vain. One by one the struggles of the past came
up to him; each had seemed a triumph when he was in
the glory of strength and hope. The splendid aims
of a higher and nobler government, built by sheer
truth and nobility of purpose upon the ashes and dust
of present corruption, the magnificent purity of the
ideal State of which he had loved to dream&ndash;all that
he had thought of and striven after as most worthy
of a true man to follow, dwindled now away into a hollow
and mocking image, more false than hollowness itself,
poorer and of less substance than a juggler&rsquo;s
show.</p>

<p>He clasped his hands over his forehead, and tried
to think, but it was of no use. Everything was vague,
broken, crushed, and shapeless. Faces seemed to rise
to his disturbed sight, and he wondered whether he
had ever known these people; a ghastly weariness as
of death was upon him, and his arms fell heavily by
his sides. He groaned aloud, and if in that bitter
sigh he could have breathed away his existence he
would have gladly done it.</p>

<p>Some one entered the room, struck a match, and lit
the gas. It was his servant, or rather the joint servant
of two or three of the bachelors who lived in the
house, a huge, smooth-faced colored man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuthe <i>me</i>, Mister Harrington,
I thought you wath out, Thir. There&rsquo;s two o&rsquo;
them notes for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John roused himself, and took the letters without
a word. They were both addressed in feminine handwriting.
The one he knew, for it was from Mrs. Wyndham. The
other he did not recognize. He opened Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;DEAR MR. HARRINGTON,&ndash;Sam and I are very much
put out about it, and sympathize most cordially. We
think you might like to come and dine this evening,
if you have no other invitation, so I write to say
we will be all alone and very glad to see you. Cordially
yours,</p>

<p>&ldquo;JANE WYNDHAM.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S. Don&rsquo;t trouble about the answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John read the note through and laid it on the table.
Then he turned the other missive over in his fingers,
and finally tore open the envelope.</p>

<p>It ran as follows:&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR MR. HARRINGTON,&ndash;Please don&rsquo;t
be surprised at my writing to you in this way. I was
at Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s this afternoon and heard all
about it, and I must write to tell you that I am very,
<i>very</i> sorry. It is too horrible to think
how bad and wicked and foolish people are, and how
they invariably do the wrong thing. I cannot tell you
how sorry we all are, because it is just such men
as you who are most needed nowadays, though of course
I know nothing about politics here. But I am quite
sure that all of them <i>will live to regret it</i>,
and that you will win in the end. Don&rsquo;t think
it foolish of me to write, because I&rsquo;m so angry
that I can&rsquo;t in the least help it, and I think
everybody ought to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours in sincerity,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;JOSEPHINE THORN.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Chapter XVII.</h1>

<p>John read Joe&rsquo;s note many times over before
he quite realized what it contained. It seemed at
first a singular thing that she should have written
to him, and he did not understand it. He knew her as
an enthusiastic and capricious girl who had sometimes
laughed at him, and sometimes treated him coldly;
but who, again, had sometimes talked with him as though
he were an old friend. He called to mind the interest
she had taken in his doings of late, and how she had
denounced Vancouver as his enemy, and he thought of
the long conversation he had had with her on the ice
under the cold moonlight. He thought of many a sympathetic
glance she had given when he spoke of his aims and
intentions, of many a gentle word spoken in praise
of him, and which at the time he had taken merely as
so much small, good-natured flattery, such as agreeable
people deal out to each other in society without any
thought of evil nor any especial meaning of good.
All these things came back to him, and he read the
little note again. It was a kindly word, nothing more,
penned by a wild, good-hearted girl, in the scorn
of consequence or social propriety. It was nothing
but that.</p>

<p>And yet, there was something more in it all&ndash;something
not expressed in the abbreviated words and hurriedly-composed
sentences, but something that seemed to struggle for
expression. John&rsquo;s experience of womankind was
limited, for he was no lady&rsquo;s man, and had led
a life singularly lacking in woman&rsquo;s love or
sentiment, though singularly dependent on the friendship
of some woman. Nevertheless he knew that Joe&rsquo;s
note breathed the essence of a sympathy wider than
that of mere every-day acquaintance, and deeper, perhaps,
than that of any friendship he had known. He could
not have explained the feeling, nor reasoned upon it,
but he knew well enough that when he next met Joe
it would be on new terms. She had declared herself
his friend in a way no longer mistakable, for she must
have followed her first impulse in writing such a note,
and the impulse must have been a strong one.</p>

<p>For a while he debated whether to answer the note
or not, almost forgetting his troubles in the tumult
of new thoughts it had suggested to him. A note, thought
he, required an answer, on general principles&ndash;but
such a note as this would be better answered in person
than by any pen and paper. He would call and see Joe,
and thank her for it. But, again, he knew he could
not see her until the next day, and that seemed a long
time to wait. It would not have been long under ordinary
circumstances, but in this case it seemed to him an
unreasonable delay. He sat down and took a pen in
his fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Thorn&rdquo;&ndash;he began, and stopped.
In America it is more formal to begin without the
preliminary &ldquo;my;&rdquo; in England the &ldquo;my&rdquo;
is indispensable, unless people are on familiar terms.
John knew this, and reflected that Joe was English.
While he was reflecting his eye fell upon a heap of
telegraph blanks, and he remembered that he had not
given notice of his defeat to the council. He pushed
aside the note paper and took a form for a cable dispatch.
In a moment Joe was forgotten in the sudden shock that
brought his thoughts back to his position. He wrote
out a simple message addressed to Z, who was the only
one of the three whom he officially knew.</p>

<p>But when he had done that, he fell to thinking about
Joe again, and resolved to write the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR MISS THORN,&ndash;I cannot allow your very
friendly words to remain unanswered until tomorrow.
It is kind of you to be sorry for the defeat I have
suffered, it is kinder still to express your sympathy
so directly and so soon. Concerning the circumstances
which brought the contest to such a result, I have
nothing to say. It is the privilege of elective bodies
to choose as they please, and indeed, that is the
object of their existence. No one has any right to
complain of not being elected, for a man who is a
candidate knows from the first what he is undertaking,
and what manner of men he has to deal with. Personally,
I am a man who has fought a fight and has lost it,
and however firmly I still believe in the cause which
led me to the struggle, I confess that I am disappointed
and disheartened at being vanquished. You are good
enough to say you believe I shall win in the end;
I can only answer that I thank you very heartily indeed
for saying so, though I do not think it is likely
that any efforts of mine will be attended with success
for a long time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe me, with great gratitude,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p>&ldquo;JOHN HARRINGTON.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a longer note than he had meant to write, in
fact it was almost a letter; but he read it over and
was convinced he had said what he meant to say, which
was always the principal consideration in such matters.
Accordingly the missive was dispatched to its destination.
As for Mrs. Wyndham, John determined to accept her
invitation, and to answer it in person by appearing
at the dinner-hour. He would not let any one think
he was so broken-hearted as to be unable to show himself.
He was too strong for that, and he had too much pride
in his strength.</p>

<p>He was right in going to Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s, for
she and her husband were his oldest friends, and he
understood well enough what true hearts and what honest
loyalty lie sometimes concealed in the bosoms of those
brisk, peculiar people, who seem unable to speak seriously
for long about the most serious subjects, and whose
quaint turns of language seem often so unfit to express
any deep feeling. But while he talked with his hosts
his own thoughts strayed again and again to Joe, and
he wondered what kind of woman she really was. He
intended to visit her the next day.</p>

<p>The next day came, however, and yet John did not turn
his steps up the hill towards Miss Schenectady&rsquo;s
house. It was a cloudless morning after the heavy
storm, and the great drifts of snow flashed like heaps
of diamonds in the sun. All the air was clear and
cold, and the red brick pavements were spotted here
and there with white patches left from the shovels
of the Irishmen. Sleighs of all sizes were ploughing
their way hither and thither, breaking out a track
in the heavy mass that encumbered the streets. Every
one was wrapped in furs, and every one&rsquo;s face
was red with the smarting cold.</p>

<p>Joe stayed at home until mid-day, when she went to
a luncheon-party of young girls. As usual, they had
been sewing for the poor, but Joe thought that she
was not depriving the poor people of any very material
assistance by staying away from the more industrious
part of the entertainment. The sewing they all did
together in a morning did not produce results whereby
even the very smallest baby could have been clothed,
and the part effected by each separate damsel in this
whole was consequently somewhat  insignificant. Joe
would have stayed at home outright had the weather
not been so magnificent, and possibly she thought
that she might meet John Harrington on her way to
the house of her friend in Dartmouth Street.</p>

<p>Fate, however, was against her, for she had not walked
thirty yards down the hill before she was overtaken
by Pocock Vancouver. He had been standing in one of
the semi-circular bay windows of the Somerset Club,
and seeing Joe coming down the steep incline, had
hurriedly taken his coat and hat and gone out in pursuit
of her. Had he suspected in the least how Joe felt
toward him, he would have fled to the end of the world
rather than meet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; he said, walking
rapidly by her side and taking off his hat, &ldquo;how
very early you are to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not early,&rdquo; said Joe, looking at
him coldly, &ldquo;it is nearly one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be called early for most people,&rdquo;
said Vancouver; &ldquo;for Mrs. Wyndham, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not Mrs. Wyndham,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to see Harrington,&rdquo; remarked
Vancouver, who perceived that Joe was not in a good
humor. &ldquo;I am afraid he must be dreadfully cut
up about this business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are going to condole with him? I do
not believe he is in the least  disturbed. He has
far too much sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy the most sensible man in the world
would be a trifle annoyed at being defeated in an
election, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; said Vancouver blandly.
&ldquo;I am afraid you are not very sorry for him.
He is an old friend of mine, and though I differ from
him in politics, very passively, I cannot do less
than go and see him, and tell him how much I regret,
personally, that he should be defeated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s lip curled in scorn, and she flushed angrily.
She could have struck Vancouver&rsquo;s pale face
with infinite pleasure and satisfaction, but she said
nothing in immediate answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not think I am right?&rdquo; asked Vancouver.
&ldquo;I am sure you do; you have such a good heart.&rdquo;
They passed Charles Street as he was speaking, and
yet he gave no sign of leaving her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I have a good heart, and
I am quite sure that you are utterly wrong, Mr. Vancouver,&rdquo;
said Joe, in calm tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? Why, you quite surprise me, Miss Thorn.
Any man in my place ought&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most men in your place would avoid Mr. Harrington,&rdquo;
interrupted Joe, turning her clear brown eyes full
upon him. Had she been less angry she would have been
more cautious. But her blood was up, and she took no
thought, but said what she meant, boldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; said Vancouver,
stiffly, &ldquo;I do not understand you in the least.
I think what you say is very extraordinary. John Harrington
has always been a friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be, Mr. Vancouver, but you are certainly
no friend of his,&rdquo; said Joe, with a scornful
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You astonish me beyond measure,&rdquo; rejoined
Pocock, maintaining his air of injured virtue, although
he inwardly felt that he was in some imminent danger.
&ldquo;How can you possibly say such a thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe could bear it no longer. She was very imprudent,
but her honest anger boiled over. She stopped in her
walk, her back against the iron railings, and she
faced Vancouver with a look that frightened him. He
was forced to stop also, and he could not do less
than return her glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you dare to stand there and tell me that
you are Mr. Harrington&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo; she
asked in low distinct tones. &ldquo;You, the writer
of articles in the &lsquo;Daily Standard,&rsquo; calling
him a fool and a charlatan? You, who have done your
very best to defeat him in this election? Indeed, it
is too absurd!&rdquo; She laughed aloud in utter scorn,
and then turned to continue her way.</p>

<p>Vancouver turned a shade paler than was natural with
him, and looked down. He was very much frightened,
for he was a coward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Thorn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am sorry
you should believe such calumnies. I give you my word
of honor that I have never either written or spoken
against Mr. Harrington. He is one of my best friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe did not answer; she did not even look at him,
but walked on in silence. He did not dare to speak
again, and as they reached the corner of the Public
Garden he lifted his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure that you will find you have
misjudged me, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; he said, with a grieved
look. &ldquo;In the mean while I wish you a very good
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Joe, without looking
at him; and she passed on, full of indignation and
wrath.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, she was so much delighted at having
spoken her mind for once, that she had not a thought
of any possible consequences. The delight of having
dealt Vancouver such a buffet was very great, and she
felt her heart beat fast with a triumphant pleasure.</p>

<p>But Vancouver turned and went away with a very unpleasant
sensation in, him. He wished with all his might that
he had not left the comfortable bay window of the
Somerset Club that morning, and more than all he wished
he could ascertain how Joe had come to know of his
journalistic doings. As a matter of fact, what she
had said concerning Pocock&rsquo;s efforts against
John in the election had been meant in a most general
way. But Vancouver thought she was referring to his
interview with Ballymolloy, and that she understood
the whole matter. Of course, there was nothing to be
done but to deny the accusations from beginning to
end; but they nevertheless had struck deep, and he
was thoroughly alarmed. When he left the club he had
had no intention of going to see Harrington; the idea
had formed itself while talking with her. But now,
again, he felt that he could not go. He had not the
courage to face the man he had injured, principally
because he strongly suspected that if Joe knew what
he had done, John Harrington most likely knew it too.</p>

<p>He was doubly hit. He would have been less completely
confused and frightened if the attack had come from
Sybil Brandon; but he had had vague ideas of trying
to marry Joe, and he guessed that any such plan was
now hopelessly out of the question. He turned his
steps homeward, uncertain what to do, and hoping to
find counsel in solitude.</p>

<p>He took up the letters and papers that lay on his
study table, brought by the mid-day post. One letter
in particular attracted his attention, and he singled
it out and opened it. It was dated from London, and
had been twelve days on its way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR VANCOUVER,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enclosed please find Bank of England Post Note
for your usual quarterly honorarium, &#163;1250. My firm
will address you upon the use to be made of the Proxies
lately sent you for the ensuing election of officers
of the Pocahontas and Dead Man&rsquo;s Valley R. R.,
touching your possession of which I beg to reiterate
the importance of a more than Masonic discretion. I
apprehend that unless the scattered shares should have
been quickly absorbed for the purpose of obtaining
a majority, these Proxies will enable you to control
the election of the proper ticket. If not, and if
the Leviathan should decline the overtures that will
be made to him during his summer visit to London,
I should like your estimate of five thousand shares
more, to be picked up in the next three months, which
will assure our friends the control. Should the prospective
figure be too high, we may elect to sell out, after
rigging the market for a boom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In either event there will be lots of pickings
in the rise and fall of the shares for the old joint
account, which has been so profitable because you
have so skillfully covered up your tracks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours faithfully,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SAUNDEKS GRABBLES.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P. S. The expectations of the young lady about
whom you inquire are involved in such a tangle of
conditions as could only have occurred to the excited
fancy of an old Anglo-Indian. He left about twenty
lacs of rupees in various bonds&ndash;G. I. P. and others&ndash;to
his nephew, Ronald Surbiton, and to his niece jointly,
provided that they marry each other. If they do not,
one quarter of the estate is to go to the one who marries
first, and the remaining three quarters to the other.
The estate is in the hands of trustees, who pay an
allowance to the heirs. In case they marry each other,
the said heirs have power to dispose by will of the
inheritance. Otherwise the whole of it reverts to
the last survivor, and at his or her death it is to
be devoted to founding a home for superannuated governesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vancouver read the letter through with care, and held
it a moment in his hand. Then he crushed it angrily
together and tossed it into the fire. It seemed as
though everything went wrong with him to-day. Not only
was no information concerning Joe of any use now.
It would be a hard thing to disabuse her of the idea
that he had written those articles. After all, though,
as he thought the matter over, it could be only guess-work.
The manuscripts had always gone through the post,
signed with a feigned name, and it was utterly impossible
that the editor himself could know who had written
them. It would be still more impossible, therefore,
for any one else to do more than make a guess. It
is easy to deny any statement, however correct, when
founded on such a basis. But there was the other thing:
Joe had accused him of having opposed John&rsquo;s
election to the best of his ability. No one could
prove that either. He had even advised Ballymolloy
to vote for John, in so many words. On the whole, his
conscience was clear enough. Vancouver&rsquo;s conscience
was represented by all those things which could by
any possibility be found out; the things that no one
could ever know gave him no anxiety. In the present
case the first thing to be done was plainly to put
the whole blame of the articles on the shoulders of
some one else, a person of violent political views
and very great vanity, who would be greatly flattered
at being thought the author of anything so clever.
That would not be a difficult task. He would broach
the subject to Mrs. Wyndham, telling her that the man,
whoever he should be, had told him in strictest confidence
that he was the writer. Vancouver would of course
tell it to Mrs. Wyndham as a state secret, and she
would tell some one else&ndash;it would soon be public
property, and Joe would hear of it. It would be easy
enough to pitch upon some individual who would not
deny the imputation, or who would deny it in such a
way as to leave the impression on the public mind
unchanged, more especially as the articles had accomplished
the desired result.</p>

<p>The prime cause of all this, John Harrington himself,
sat in his room, unconscious, for the time, of Vancouver&rsquo;s
existence. He was in a state of great depression and
uncertainty, for he had not yet rallied from the blow
of the defeat. Moreover he was thinking of Joe, and
her letter lay open on the table beside him. His whole
heart went out to her in thanks for her ready sympathy,
and he had almost made up his mind to go and see her,
as he had at first determined to do.</p>

<p>He would have laughed very heartily at the idea of
being in love, for he had never thought of himself
in such a position. But he realized that he was fond
of Josephine Thorn, that he was thinking of her a great
deal, and that the thought was a comfort to him in
his distress. He knew very well that he would find
a great rest and refreshment in talking to her at
present, and yet he could not decide to go to her.
John was a man of calm manner and with plenty of hard,
practical sense, in spite of the great enthusiasm
that burned like a fire within him, and that was the
mainspring of his existence. But like all orators
and men much accustomed to dealing with the passions
of others, he was full of quick intuitions and instincts
which rarely betrayed him. Something warned him not
to seek her society, and though he said to himself
that he was very far from being in love, the thought
that he might some day find that he wished to marry
her presented itself continually to his mind; and
since John had elected to devote himself to celibacy
and politics, there was nothing more repugnant to his
whole life than the idea of marriage.</p>

<p>At this juncture, while he was revolving in his mind
what was best to be done, a telegram was brought to
him. It was from Z, and in briefest terms of authority
commanded John to hold himself ready to start for London
at a moment&rsquo;s notice. It must have been dispatched
within a few hours after receiving his own message
of the night before, and considering the difference
of time, must have been sent from London early in the
afternoon. It was clearly an urgent case, and the supreme
three had work for John to do, even though he had
not been made senator.</p>

<p>The order was a great relief. It solved all his uncertainty
and scattered all his doubts to the wind. It gave
him new courage and stimulated his curiosity. Z had
only sent for him twice before, and then only to call
him from Boston or New York to Washington. It was
clear that something of very great importance was
likely to occur. His energy returned in full, with
the anticipation of work to do and of a journey to
be made, and before night he was fully prepared to
leave on receipt of his orders. His box was packed,
and he had drawn the money necessary to take him to
London.</p>

<p>As for Joe, he could go and see her now if he pleased.
In twenty-four hours he might be gone, never to see
her again. But it was too late on that day&ndash;he would
go on the following morning.</p>

<p>It was still the height of the Boston season, which
is short, but merry while it lasts. John had a dinner-party,
a musical evening, and a ball on his list for the
evening, and he resolved that he would go to all three,
and show himself bravely to the world. He was full
of new courage and strength since he had received
Z&rsquo;s message, and he was determined that no one
should know what he had suffered.</p>

<p>The dinner passed pleasantly enough, and by ten o&rsquo;clock
he was at the musical party. There he found the Wyndhams
and many other friends, but he looked in vain for
Joe; she was not there. Before midnight he was at the
dance, pushing his way through crowds of acquaintances,
stumbling over loving couples ensconced on the landings
of the stairs, and running against forlorn old ladies,
whose mouths were full of ice-cream and their hearts
of bitterness against the younger generation; and so,
at last, he reached the ball-room, where everything
that was youngest and most fresh was assembled, swaying
and gliding, and backing and turning in the easy,
graceful half-walk, half-slide of the Boston step.</p>

<p>As John stood looking on, Joe passed him, leaving
the room on Mr. Topeka&rsquo;s arm. There was a little
open space before her in the crowd, and Pocock Vancouver
darted out with the evident intention of speaking to
her. But as she caught sight of him she turned suddenly
away, pulling Mr. Topeka round by his arm. It was
an extremely &ldquo;marked thing to do.&rdquo; As she
turned she unexpectedly came face to face with John,
who had watched the maneuver. The color came quickly
to her face, and she was slightly embarrassed; nevertheless
she held out her hand and greeted John cordially.</p>

<h1>Chapter XVIII.</h1>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad to have found you,&rdquo; said
John to Josephine, when the latter had disposed of
Mr. Topeka. They had chosen a quiet corner in a dimly-lighted
room away from the dancers. &ldquo;But I suppose it
is useless to ask you for a dance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe, looking at her card; &ldquo;I
always leave two dances free in the middle of the
evening in case I am tired. We will sit them out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said John, looking at her.
She looked pale and a little tired, but wonderfully
lovely. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and
thank you also for your most kind note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could tell you better how very sorry
I am,&rdquo; said Joe, impulsively. &ldquo;It is bad
enough to look on and see such things done, but I
should think you must be nearly distracted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I was at first,&rdquo; said John, simply.
&ldquo;But one soon grows used to it. Man is a vain
animal, and I suppose no one could lose a fight as
I have without being disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were not disappointed it would be a
sign you did not really care,&rdquo; answered Joe.
&ldquo;And of course you must care&ndash;a great, great
deal. It is a loss to your cause, as well as a loss
to yourself. But you cannot possibly give it up; you
will win next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I hope I shall
win some day.&rdquo; But his voice sounded uncertain;
it lacked that determined ring that Joe loved so well.
She felt as she sat beside him that he was deeply
hurt and needed fresh encouragement and strength to
restore him to his old self. She longed to help him
and to rouse him once more to the consciousness of
power and the hope of victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my experience,&rdquo; said she with an
air of superiority that would have been amusing if
she had spoken less earnestly&ndash;&ldquo;it is my experience
that one should never think of anything in which one
has come to grief. I know, when one is going at a
big thing&ndash;a double post and rails with a ditch, or
anything like that, you know&ndash;it would never do to
remember that you have come off at the same thing
or at something else before. When a man is always
remembering his last tumble he has lost his nerve,
and had better give up hunting altogether. Thinking
that you may get an ugly fall will not help you over
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;that is very true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must forget all about it and begin again.
You have missed one bird, but you are a good shot,
and you will not miss the next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a most encouraging person, Miss Thorn,&rdquo;
said John with a faint smile. &ldquo;But you know
the only test of a good shot is that one hits the
mark. I have missed at the first trial, and that is
no reason why I should not miss at the second, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are disappointed and unhappy now,&rdquo;
said Joe, gently. &ldquo;It is very natural indeed.
Anybody would feel like that. But you must not believe
in yourself any less than your friends believe in
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy my friends do not all think alike,&rdquo;
answered John. &ldquo;But I am grateful to you for
what you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was indeed grateful, and the soothing sound of
her gentle voice was the best refreshment for his
troubled spirit. He thought for a moment how brave
a man could be with such a woman by his side; and the
thought pleased him, the more because he knew that
it could not be realized. They sat in silence for
a while, contented to be together, and in sympathy.
But before long the anxiety for the future and the
sense of his peculiar position came over John again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are
times when I regret it all very much? I never told
any one so before&ndash;perhaps I was never so sure of it
as I have been since this affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it that you regret so much?&rdquo;
asked Joe, softly. &ldquo;It is a noble life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, indeed, if only a man knows how to live
it,&rdquo; answered John. &ldquo;But sometimes I think
I do not. You once said a very true thing to me about
it all. Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; what was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said I should not succeed because I am
not enough of a partisan, and because every one is
a partisan here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I? Yes, I remember saying it,&rdquo; answered
Joe, secretly pleased that he should not have forgotten
it. &ldquo;I do not think it is so very true, after
all. It is true to-day; but it is for men like you
to set things right, to make partisanship a thing
of the past. Men ought to make laws because they are
just and necessary, not in order that they may profit
by them at the expense of the rest of the world. And
to have such good laws men ought to choose good men
to represent them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no denying the truth of that,&rdquo;
said John. &ldquo;That is the way to construct the
ideal republic. It would be the way to do a great many
ideal things. You need only persuade humanity to do
right, and humanity will do it. Verily, it is an easy
task!&rdquo; He laughed, a little bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not like you to laugh in that way,&rdquo;
said Joe, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; to tell the truth, I am not overmuch inclined
to laugh at anything to-day, excepting myself, and
I dare say there are plenty of people who will do
that for me without the asking. They will have no chance
when I am gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe started slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Are you going
away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very likely,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;A
friend of mine has warned me to be ready to start
at a moment&rsquo;s notice on very important business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is uncertain, then?&rdquo; asked Joe,
quickly. She had turned very white in an instant,
and she looked straight across the little room and
pulled nervously at her fan. She would not have dared
to let her eyes meet John&rsquo;s at that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, rather uncertain,&rdquo; answered John.
&ldquo;But he would not have sent me such a warning
unless it were very likely that he would really want
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe was silent; she could not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; continued Harrington, &ldquo;I
may leave to-morrow, and I cannot tell when I may
come back. That is the reason I was glad to find you
here. I would have called to-day, if it had been possible,
after I got the message.&rdquo; He spoke calmly, not
dreaming of the storm of fear and passion he was rousing
in the heart of the fair girl beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&ndash;where are you going?&rdquo; asked Joe
in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably to England,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>Before the words were out of his mouth he turned and
looked at her, suddenly realizing the change in her
tones. But she had turned away from him. He could
see the quiver of her lips and the beating throb of
her beautiful throat; and as he watched the outline
of her cheek a tear stole slowly over the delicate
skin, and trembled, and fell upon her white neck.
But still she looked away.</p>

<p>Ah, John Harrington, what have you done? You have
taken the most precious and pure thing in this world,
the thing men as brave as you have given their heart&rsquo;s
best blood to win and have perished for failing, the
thing which angels guard and Heaven has in its keeping&ndash;the
love of a good and noble woman. It has come into your
hands and you do not want it. You hardly know it is
yours; and if you fully knew it you would not know
what to do!</p>

<p>You are innocent, indeed; you have done nothing, spoken
no word, given no look that, in your opinion, your
cold indifferent opinion, could attract a woman&rsquo;s
love. But the harm is done, nevertheless, and a great
harm too. When you are old and sensible you will look
back to this day as one of sorrow and evil, and you
will know then that all greatness and power and glory
of realized ambition are nothing unless a man have
a woman&rsquo;s love. You will know that a man who
cannot love is blind to half the world he seeks to
conquer, and that a man who cannot love truly is no
true man, for he who is not true to one cannot be
true to many. That is the sum and reckoning of what
love is worth.</p>

<p>But John knew of nothing beyond friendship, and he
could not conceive how friendship could turn into
anything else. When he saw the tear on Josephine Thorn&rsquo;s
cheek he was greatly disturbed, and vaguely wondered
what in the world he should do. The idea that any woman
could care enough for him to shed a tear when he left
her had never crossed his mind; even now, with the
actual fact before his eyes, he doubted whether it
were possible. She was ill, perhaps, and suffering
pain. Pshaw! it was absurd, it could not be that she
cared so much for him.</p>

<p>Seeing she did not move, he sat quite still for a
while. His usual tact had deserted him in the extremity
of the situation. He revolved in his mind what was
best to say. It was safest to suppose that Joe was
ill, but he would say something indifferent, in order
to see whether she recovered, before he suggested
that he might be of assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is cold here,&rdquo; he remarked, trying
to speak as naturally as possible. &ldquo;Would you
not like to take a turn, Miss Thorn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe moved a little. She was deadly pale, and in the
effort she had made to control her feelings she was
unconscious of the tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, thanks,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;I
will not dance just now.&rdquo; She could not say
more.</p>

<p>John made up his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are ill, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; he said anxiously.
&ldquo;I am sure you are very far from well. Let me
get you something, or call your aunt. Shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no&ndash;don&rsquo;t&ndash;that is&ndash;please, I think
so. I will go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John rose quickly, but before he reached the door
she called him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harrington, it is nothing. Please sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John came back and did as he was bid, more and more
surprised and confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid it was something serious,&rdquo;
he said nervously, for he was greatly disturbed.</p>

<p>Joe laughed, a bitter, harsh little laugh, that was
bad to hear. She was making a great effort, but she
was strong, and bravely forced back her bursting tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! I was only choking,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I often do. Go on, please, with what you were
saying. Why are you going away so suddenly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; answered John, &ldquo;I do not
know what the business is. I am going if I am required,
simply because my friend wants me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; asked Joe, speaking
more calmly, &ldquo;that you will pack up your belongings
and go to the end of the world whenever a friend asks
you to? It is most tremendously obliging, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for any friend,&rdquo; John replied. &ldquo;But
I would most certainly do it for this particular one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be very fond of him to do that,&rdquo;
said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am under great obligations to him, too. He
is certainly the most important man with whom I have
any relations. We can trust each other-it would not
do to endanger the certainty of good faith that exists
between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be a very wonderful person,&rdquo;
said Joe, who had grown quite calm by this time. &ldquo;I
should like to know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very possibly you may meet him, some day. He
is a very wonderful person indeed, as you say. He
has devoted fifty years of his life and strength to
the unremitting pursuit of the best aim that any man
can set before him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;he
is your ideal. He is what you hope to be at his age.
He must be very old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is old. As for his representing my
ideal, I think he approaches more nearly to it than
any man alive. But you would probably not like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He belongs to a class of men whom old-world
people especially dislike,&rdquo; answered John. &ldquo;He
does not believe in any monarchy, aristocracy, or
distinction of birth. He looks upon titles as a decaying
institution of barbarous ages, and he confidently
asserts that in two or three generations the republic
will be the only form of social contract known amongst
the inhabitants of the civilized world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John was watching Joe while he spoke. He was merely
talking because it seemed necessary, and he saw that
in spite of her assumed calm she was still greatly
agitated. She seemed anxious, however, to continue
the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is absurd,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to say
that all men are born equal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything depends on what you mean by the
word &lsquo;equal.&rsquo; I mean by it that all men
are born with an equal claim to a share in all the
essential rights of free citizenship. When a man demands
more than that, he is infringing on the rights of
others; when he is content with less, he is allowing
himself to be robbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who is to decide just how much belongs
to each man?&rdquo; asked Joe, leaning back wearily
against the cushions. She wished now that she had
allowed him to call her aunt. It was a fearful strain
on her faculties to continue talking upon general
subjects and listening to John Harrington&rsquo;s
calm, almost indifferent tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The majority decides that,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a majority has just decided that you are
not to be senator,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;According
to you they were right, were they not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is necessary that the majority should be
free,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;and that they should
judge of themselves, each man according to his honest
belief. Majorities with us are very frequently produced
by a handful of dishonest men, who can turn the scale
on either side, to suit their private ends. It is
the aim we set before us to protect the freedom of
majorities. That is the true doctrine of a republic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for that aim,&rdquo; said Joe, slowly,
&ldquo;you would sacrifice everything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed we would,&rdquo; said John, gravely.
&ldquo;For that end we will sacrifice all that we
have to give&ndash;the care for personal satisfaction,
the hope of personal distinction, the peace of a home
and the love of a wife. We seek neither distinction
nor satisfaction, and we renounce all ties that could
hamper our strength or interfere with the persevering
and undivided attention we try to give to our work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a magnificent programme,&rdquo; said
Joe, somewhat incredulously. &ldquo;Do you not think
it is possible sometimes to aim too high? You say &lsquo;we
seek,&rsquo; &lsquo;we try,&rsquo; as though there
were several of you, or at least, some one besides
yourself. Do you believe that such ideas as you tell
me of are really and seriously held by any body of
men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing had seemed too high to Josephine an hour earlier,
nothing too exalted, nothing so noble but that John
Harrington might do it, then and there. But a sudden
change had come over her, the deadly cold phase of
half melancholy unbelief that often follows close upon
an unexpected disappointment, so that she looked with
distaste on anything that seemed so full of the enthusiasm
she had lost. The tears that bad risen so passionately
to her dimmed eyes were suddenly frozen, and seemed
to flow back with chilling force to her heart. She
coldly asked herself whether she were mad, that she
could have suffered thus for such a man, even ever
so briefly. He was a man, she said, who loved an unattainable,
fanatic idea in the first place, and who dearly loved
himself as well for his own fanaticism&rsquo;s sake.
He was a man in whom the heart was crushed, even annihilated,
by his intellect, which he valued far too highly, and
by his vanity, which he dignified into a philosophy
of self-sacrifice. He was aiming at what no man can
reach, and though he knew his object to be beyond
human grasp, he desired all possible credit for having
madly dreamed of anything so high. In the sudden revulsion
of her strong passion, she almost hated him, she almost
felt the power to refute his theories, to destroy
his edifice of fantastic morality, and finally to
show him that he was a fool among men, and doubly a
fool, because he was not even happy in his own folly.</p>

<p>Joe vaguely felt all this, and with it she felt a
sense of shame at having so nearly broken down at
the news that he was going away. He had thought she
was ill; most assuredly he could not have guessed the
cause of what he had seen; but nevertheless she had
suffered a keen pain, and the tears had come to her
eyes. She did not understand it. He might leave her
now, if he pleased, and she would not care; indeed,
it would be rather a relief if he would go. She no
longer asked what she was to him, she simply reflected
that, after all was said, he was nothing to her. She
felt a quick antagonism to his ideas, to his words,
and to himself, and she was willing to show it. She
asked him incredulously whether his ideas were really
held by others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes little difference,&rdquo; answered
John, &ldquo;whether they are many or few who think
as I do, and I cannot tell how many there may be. The
truth is not made truth because many people believe
it. The world went round, as Galileo knew, although
he alone stood up and said it in the face of mankind,
who scoffed at him for his pains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words, you occupy the position of
Galileo,&rdquo; suggested Joe, calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;but there are
men, and there have been men, in our country who know
truths as great as any he discovered, and who have
spent their lives in proclaiming them. I <i>know</i>
that they are right, and that I am right, and that,
however we may fail, others will succeed at last.
I know that, come what may, honor and truth and justice
will win the day in the end!&rdquo; His gray eyes
glittered as he spoke, and his broad white hands clasped
nervously together in his enthusiasm. He was depressed
and heartsick at his failure, but it needed only one
word of opposition to rouse the strong main thought
of his life into the most active expression. But Joe
sat coldly by, her whole nature seemingly changed in
the few minutes that had passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all this will be brought about by the measures
you advocated the other day,&rdquo; said she with
a little laugh. &ldquo;A civil service, a little tariff
reform&ndash;that is enough to inaugurate the reign of honor,
truth, and justice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John turned his keen eyes upon hers. He had begun
talking because she had  required it of him, and he
had been roused by the subject. He remembered the
sympathy she had given him, and he was annoyed at her
caprice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such things are the mere passing needs of a
time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The truth, justice, and
honor, at which you are pleased to be amused, would
insure the execution at all times of what is right
and needful. Without a foundation composed of the
said truth, justice, and honor, to get what is right
and needful is often a matter so stupendous that the
half of a nation&rsquo;s blood is drained in accomplishing
the task, if even it is accomplished after all. I
see nothing to laugh at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, Joe was only smiling faintly, but John was
so deeply impressed and penetrated by the absolute
truth of what he was saying, that he had altogether
ceased to make any allowances for Joe&rsquo;s caprice
of mood or for the disturbance in her manner that
he had so lately witnessed. He was beginning to be
angry, and she had never seen him in such a mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world would be a very nice tiresome place
to live in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if every one always
did exactly what is absolutely right. I should not
like to live among people who would be always so entirely
padded and lined with goodness as they must be in
your ideal republic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a favorite and characteristic notion
of modern society to associate goodness with dullness,
and consequently, I suppose, to connect badness with
all that is gay, interesting, and diverting. There
is nothing more perverted, absurd, and contemptible
than that notion in the whole history of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John was not gentle with an idea when he despised
it, and the adjectives fell in his clear utterance
like the blows of a sledge-hammer. But as the idea
he was abusing had been suggested by Joe, she resented
the strong language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am flattered that you should call anything
I say by such bad names,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
am not good at arguing and that sort of thing. If I
were I think I could answer you very easily. Will
you please take me back to my aunt?&rdquo; She rose
in a somewhat stately fashion.</p>

<p>John was suddenly aware that he had talked too much
and too strongly, and he was very sorry to have displeased
her. She had always let him talk as he pleased, especially
of late, and she had almost invariably agreed with
him in everything he said, so that he had acquired
too much confidence. At all events, that was the way
he explained to himself the present difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please forgive me, Miss Thorn,&rdquo; he said
humbly, as he gave her his arm to leave the room.
&ldquo;I am a very sanguine person, and I often talk
great nonsense. Please do not be angry.&rdquo; Joe
paused just as they reached the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angry? I am not angry,&rdquo; she said with
sudden gentleness. &ldquo;Besides, you know, this
is&ndash;you are really going away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if you do,&rdquo; she said with some
hesitation&ndash;&ldquo;if you do, this is good-by, is
it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am afraid it is,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;but
not for long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for long, perhaps,&rdquo; she answered;
&ldquo;but I would not like you to think I was angry
the very last time I saw you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. I should be very sorry if you were.
But you are not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Well then&rdquo;&ndash;she held out her hand&ndash;&ldquo;Good-by,
then.&rdquo; She had almost hated him a few minutes
ago. Half an hour earlier she had loved him. Now her
voice faltered a little, but her face was calm.</p>

<p>John took the proffered hand and grasped it warmly.
With all her caprice, and despite the strange changes
of her manner toward him, she had been a good friend
in a bad time during the last days, and he was more
sorry to leave her than he would himself have believed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and thank you
once more, with all my heart, for your friendship
and kindness.&rdquo; Their hands remained clasped for
a moment; then she took his arm again, and he led
her out of the dimly-lighted sitting-room back among
the brilliant dancers and the noise and the music and
the whirling crowd.</p>

<h1>Chapter XIX.</h1>

<p>A change has come over Boston in four months, since
John Harrington and Josephine Thorn parted. The breath
of the spring has been busy everywhere, and the haze
of the hot summer is ripening the buds that the spring
has brought out. The trees on the Common are thick
and heavy with foliage, the Public Garden is a carpet
of bright flowers, and on the walls of Beacon Street
the great creepers have burst into blossom and are
stretching long shoots over the brown stone and the
iron balconies. There is a smell of violets and flowers
in the warm air, and down on the little pond the swan-shaped
boats are paddling about with their cargoes of merry
children and calico nursery-maids, while the Irish
boys look on from the banks and throw pebbles when
the policemen are not looking, wishing they had the
spare coin necessary to embark for a ten minutes&rsquo;
voyage on the mimic sea. Unfamiliar figures wander
through the streets of the West End, and more than
half the houses show by the boarded windows and doors
that the owners are out of town.</p>

<p>The migration of the &ldquo;tax-dodgers&rdquo; took
place on the last day of April; they will return on
the second day of December, having spent just six
months and one day in their country places, whereby
they have shifted the paying of a large proportion
of their taxes to more economical regions. It is a
very equitable arrangement, for it is only the rich
man who can save money in this way, while his poorer
neighbor, who has no country-seat to which he may
escape, must pay to the uttermost farthing. The system
stimulates the impecunious to become wealthy and helps
the rich to become richer. It is, therefore, perfectly
good and just.</p>

<p>But Boston is more beautiful in the absence of the
&ldquo;tax-dodger&rdquo; than at any other season.
There is a stillness and a peace over the fair city
that one may long for in vain during the winter. Business
indeed goes on without interruption, but the habitation
of the great men of business knows them not. They
come up from their cool bowers by the sea, in special
trains, in steamers, and in yachts, every morning,
and early in the afternoon they go back, so that all
day long the broad streets at the west are quiet and
deserted, and seem to be basking in the sunshine to
recover from the combined strain of the bitter winter
and the unceasing gayety that accompanies it.</p>

<p>In the warm June weather Miss Schenectady and Joe
still linger in town. The old lady has no new-fangled
notions about taxes, and though she is rich and has
a pretty place near Newport, she will not go there
until she is ready, no, not for all the tax-gatherers
in Massachusetts. As for Joe, she does not want to
go away. Urgent letters come by every mail entreating
her to return to England in time for a taste of the
season in London, but they lie unanswered on her table,
and often she does not read more than half of what
they contain. The books and the letters accumulate
in her room, and she takes no thought whether she
reads them or not, for the time is weary on her hands
and she only wishes it gone, no matter how. Nevertheless
she will not go home, and she even begs her aunt not
to leave Boston yet.</p>

<p>She is paler than she was and her face looks thin.
She says she is well and as strong as ever, but the
elasticity is gone from her step, and the light has
faded in her brown eyes, so that one might meet her
in the street and hardly know her. As she sits by
the window, behind the closed blinds, the softened
light falls on her face, and it is sad and weary.</p>

<p>It was not until John Harrington was gone that she
realized all. He had received the message he expected
early on the morning after that memorable parting,
and before mid-day he was on his way. Since then she
had heard no word of tidings concerning him, save
that she knew he had arrived in England. For anything
she knew he might even now be in America again, but
she would not believe it. If he had come back he would
surely have come to see her, she thought. There were
times when she would have given all the world to look
on his face again, but for the most part she said to
herself it was far better that she should never see
him. Where was the use?</p>

<p>Joe was not of the women who have intimate confidants
and can get rid of much sorrow by much talking about
it. She was too proud and too strong to ask for help
or sympathy in any real distress. She had gone to Sybil
Brandon when she was about to tell Ronald of her decision,
because she thought that Sybil would be kind to him
and help him to forget the past; but where she herself
was alone concerned, she would rather have died many
deaths than confess what was in her heart.</p>

<p>She had gone bravely through the remainder of the
season, until all was over, and no one had guessed
her disappointment. Such perfect physical strength
as hers was not to be broken down by the effort of
a few weeks, and still she smiled and talked and danced
and kept her secret. But as the long months crawled
out their tale of dreary days, the passion in her soul
spread out great roots and grew fiercely against the
will that strove to break it down. It was a love against
which there was no appeal, which had taken possession
silently and stealthily, with no outward show of wooing
or sweet words; and then, safe within the fortress
of her maidenly soul, it had grown up to a towering
strength, feeding upon her whole life, and ruthlessly
dealing with her as it would. But this love sought
no confidence, nor help, nor assistance, being of
itself utterly without hope, strong and despairing.</p>

<p>One satisfaction only she had daily. She rejoiced
that she had broken away from the old ties, from Ronald
and from her English life. To have found herself positively
loving one man while she was betrothed to another would
have driven her to terrible extremity; the mere idea
of going back to her mother and to the old life at
home with this wild thought forever gnawing at her
heart was intolerable. She might bear it to the end,
whatever the end might be, and in silence, so long
as none of her former associations made the contrast
between past and present too strong. Old Miss Schenectady,
with her books and her odd conversation, was as good
a companion as any one, since she could not live alone.
Sybil Brandon would have wearied her by her sympathy,
gentle and loving as it would have been; and besides,
Sybil was away from Boston and very happy; it would
be unkind, as well as foolish, to disturb her serenity
with useless confidences. And so the days went by
and the hot summer was come, and yet Joe lingered
in Boston, suffering silently and sometimes wondering
how it would all end.</p>

<p>Sybil was staying near Newport with her only surviving
relation, an uncle of her mother. He was an old man,
upward of eighty years of age, and he lived in a strange
old place six or seven miles from the town. But Ronald
had been there more than once, and he was always enthusiastic
in his description of what he had seen, and he seemed
particularly anxious that Joe should know how very
happy Sybil was in her country surroundings. Ronald
had traveled during the spring, making short journeys
in every direction, and constantly talking of going
out to see the West, a feat which he never accomplished.
He would go away for a week at a time and then suddenly
appear again, and at last had gravitated to Newport.
Thence he came to town occasionally and visited Joe,
never remaining more than a day, and sometimes only
a few hours. Joe was indifferent to his comings and
goings, but always welcomed him in a friendly way.
She saw that he was amusing himself, and was more
glad than ever that the relations formerly existing
between them had been so opportunely broken off. He
had never referred to the past since the final interview
when Joe had answered him by bursting into tears,
and he talked about the present cheerfully enough.</p>

<p>One morning he arrived without warning, as usual,
to make one of his short visits. Joe was sitting by
the window dressed all in white, and the uniform absence
of color in her dress rather exaggerated the pallor
of her face than masked it. She was reading, apparently
with some interest, in a book of which the dark-lined
binding sufficiently declared the sober contents.
As she read, her brows bent in the effort of understanding,
while the warm breeze that blew through the blinds
fanned her tired face and gently stirred the small
stray ringlets of her soft brown hair. Ronald opened
the door and entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ronald!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, starting
a little nervously, &ldquo;have you come up? You look
like the sunshine. Come in, and shut the door.&rdquo;
He did as he was bidden, and came and sat beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I nave come up for the day. How are you,
Joe dear? You look pale. It is this beastly heat&ndash;you
ought to come down to Newport for a month. It is utterly
idiotic, you know, staying in town in this weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I like the
heat so much that I think I should be cold in Newport.
Tell me all about what you have been doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hardly know,&rdquo; said Ronald. &ldquo;Lots
of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you do in one day&ndash;yesterday,
for instance. I want to be amused this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so very amusing, you know, but it
is very jolly,&rdquo; answered Ronald. &ldquo;To begin
with, I get up at unholy hours and go and bathe in
the surf at the second beach. There are no end of
a a lot of people there even at that hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dare say. And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then I go home and dress: and later, if
I do not ride, I go to the club&ndash;casino, I beg its
pardon!&ndash;and play tennis. They play very decently,
some of those fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any nice rides?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just along the roads, you know. But when you
get out to Sherwood there are meadows and things&ndash;with
a brook. That is very fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you still go to Sherwood often? How is Sybil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ronald, and a blush rose quickly
to his face, &ldquo;I often go there. It is such a
queer old place, you know, full of trees and old summer-houses
and graveyards&ndash;awfully funny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Ronald,&rdquo; said Joe, insisting
a little, &ldquo;how is Sybil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks very well, so I suppose she is. But
she never goes to anything in Newport; she has not
been in the town at all yet, since she went to stay
with her uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of course lots of people go out to see
her, do they not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, not many. In fact I do not remember
to have met any one there,&rdquo; answered Ronald,
as though he were trying to recall some face besides
Miss Brandon&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Her uncle is such an
odd bird, you have no idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not imagine you see very much of him when
you go out there,&rdquo; said Joe, with a faint laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I always see him, of course,&rdquo; said
Ronald, blushing again. &ldquo;He is about a hundred
years old, and wears all kinds of clothes, and wanders
about the garden perpetually. But I do not talk to
him unless I am driven to it&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which does not occur often,&rdquo; interrupted
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I suppose not very often. Why should
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald was visibly embarrassed. Joe watched him with
a look of amusement on her face; but affectionately,
too, as though what he said pleased her as well as
amused her. There was a short pause, during which Ronald
rubbed his hat slowly and gently. Then he looked up
suddenly and met Joe&rsquo;s eyes; but he turned away
again instantly, blushing redder than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ronald,&rdquo; Joe said presently, &ldquo;I
am so glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad? Why? About what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you like her, and that she likes
you. I think you like her very much, Ronald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, very much,&rdquo; repeated Ronald,
trying to seem indifferent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not feel as though we were much more
like brother and sister now?&rdquo; asked Joe, after
a little while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, much!&rdquo; assented Ronald. &ldquo;I
suppose it is better, too, though I did not think
so at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is far better,&rdquo; said Joe, laying her
small, thin hand across her cousin&rsquo;s strong
fingers and pressing them a little. &ldquo;You are
free now, and you will probably be very happy before
long. Do you not think so?&rdquo; she asked, looking
affectionately into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Ronald, with a last
attempt at indifference. Then suddenly his face softened,
and he added in a gentler tone, &ldquo;Indeed, Joe,
I think I shall be very happy soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; said Joe again, still
holding his hand, but leaning her head back wearily
in the deep chair. &ldquo;There is only one thing that
troubles me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That horrid will,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I
am sure we could get it altered in some way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never thought about it before, Joe. Why
should we think about it now? It seems to me it is
a very good will as things have turned out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;if
you are married to Sybil Brandon, you will need ever
so much money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald blushed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not asked her to marry me,&rdquo; he
said quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference at all,&rdquo; replied
Joe. &ldquo;As I was saying, when you have married
her you will need money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Ronald, indignantly.
&ldquo;As if any one wanted to be rich in order to
be happy. Besides, between what I have of my own, and
my share of the money, there is nearly four thousand
a year; and then there is the place in Lanarkshire
for us to live in. As if that were not enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so very much, though,&rdquo; said
Joe, reflecting. &ldquo;I do not think Sybil has anything
at all. You will be as poor as two little church mice;
but I will come and stay with you sometimes,&rdquo;
Joe added, laughing, &ldquo;and help you about the
bills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bills would take care of themselves,&rdquo;
said Ronald, gravely. &ldquo;They always do. But whatever
happens, Joe, my home is always yours. You will always
remember that, will you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Ronald,&rdquo; answered his cousin affectionately,
&ldquo;you are as good as it is possible to be&ndash;you
really are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ronald,&rdquo; said Joe, after a pause, &ldquo;I
have an idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her inquiringly, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might,&rdquo; she continued, smiling at the
thought&ndash;&ldquo;I may go and marry first, you know,
after all, and spoil it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will not, will you? Promise me you
will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;and
then you could have the money&rdquo;&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I would not let you,&rdquo; interrupted
Ronald. &ldquo;I would go off and get married by license,
and that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without asking Miss Brandon?&rdquo; suggested
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; ejaculated Ronald, coloring
for the twentieth time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we are talking nonsense altogether,&rdquo;
said Joe, seriously. &ldquo;I do not think, indeed
I am quite sure, I shall never marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; cried Ronald. &ldquo;The
idea of your not marrying. It is perfectly ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name of John Harrington was on his lips, but he
checked himself. John was gone abroad, and with more
than usual tact, Ronald reflected that, if Joe had
really cared for the man, an allusion to him would
be unkind. But Joe only shook her head, and let her
cousin&rsquo;s words pass unanswered.</p>

<p>She had long suspected, from Ronald&rsquo;s frequent
allusions to Sybil, which were generally accompanied
by some change of manner, that he was either already
in love with the fair American girl, or that he soon
would be, and the acknowledgment she had now received
from himself gave her infinite pleasure. In her reflections
upon her own conduct she had never blamed herself,
but she had more than once thought that he was greatly
to be pitied. To have married him six months ago,
when she was fully conscious that she did not love
him, would have been very wrong; and to have gone
back at a later period, when she realized that her
whole life was full of her love for John Harrington,
would have been a crime. But in spite of that she
was often very sorry for Ronald, and feared that she
had hurt his happiness past curing. Now, therefore,
when she saw how much he loved another, she was exceedingly
glad, for she knew that the thing she had done had
been wholly good, both for him and for her.</p>

<p>They soon began to talk of other things, but the conversation
fell back to the discussion of Newport, and Joe learned
with some surprise that Pocock Vancouver assiduously
cultivated Ronald&rsquo;s acquaintance, and was always
ready to do anything in the world that Ronald desired.
It appeared that Vancouver lent Ronald his horses
at all times, and was apparently delighted when Ronald
would take a mount and stay away all day. The young
Englishman, of course, was not loath to accept such
offers, having a radical and undisguised contempt
for hired horseflesh, and as Sybil lived several miles
out of town, it was far the most pleasant plan to ride
out to her, and after spending the day there, to ride
back in the evening, more especially as it cost him
nothing.</p>

<p>Joe was on the point of making some remark upon Vancouver,
which would very likely have had the effect of cooling
the intimacy between him and Ronald; but she thought
better of it, and said nothing. Ronald had had no
part in all the questions connected with John&rsquo;s
election, and knew nothing of what Vancouver had done
in the matter. It was better on many grounds not to
stir up fresh trouble, and so long as Vancouver&rsquo;s
stables afforded Ronald an easy and economical means
of locomotion from Newport to the house of the woman
he loved, the friendship that had sprung up was a
positive gain. She could not understand the motives
that prompted Vancouver in the least. He had made
more than one attempt to regain his position with
her after the direct cut he had sustained on the evening
when she parted with John; but Joe had resolutely set
her face against him. Possibly she thought Vancouver
might hope to regain her good opinion by a regular
system of kindness to Ronald; but it hardly seemed
to her as though such a result would reward him for
the pains of his diplomacy. Meanwhile it would be
foolish of her to interfere with any intimacy which
was of real use to Ronald in his suit.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Vancouver was carrying out a
deliberate plan, and one which was far from ill-conceived.
He had not been so blind as not to suspect Joe&rsquo;s
secret attachment for John, when she was willing to
go to such lengths in her indignation against himself
for being John&rsquo;s enemy. But he had disposed
of John, as he thought, by assisting, if not actually
causing, his defeat. He imagined that Harrington had
gone abroad to conceal the mortification he felt at
having lost the election, and he rightly argued that
for some time Joe would not bestow a glance upon any
one else. In the mean time, however, he was in possession
of certain details concerning Joe&rsquo;s fortune
which could be of use, and he accordingly set about
encouraging Ronald&rsquo;s affections in any direction
they might take, so long as they were not set upon
his cousin. He was not surprised that Ronald should
fall in love with Sybil, though he almost wished the
choice could have fallen upon some one else, and accordingly
he did everything in his power to make life in Newport
agreeable for the young Englishman. It was convenient
in some respects that the wooing should take place
at so central a resort; but had the case been different,
Vancouver would not have hesitated to go to Saratoga,
Lenox, or Mount Desert, in the prosecution of his
immediate purpose, which was to help Ronald to marry
any living woman rather than let him return to England
a bachelor.</p>

<p>When Ronald should be married, Joe would be in possession
of three quarters of her uncle&rsquo;s money&ndash;a very
considerable fortune. If she was human, thought Vancouver,
she would be eternally grateful to him for ridding
her of her cousin, whom she evidently did not wish
to marry, and for helping her thereby to so much wealth.
He reflected that he had been unfortunate in the time
when he had decided to be a candidate for her hand;
but whatever turn affairs took, no harm was done to
his own prospects by removing Ronald from the list
of possible rivals. He was delighted at the preference
Surbiton showed for Sybil Brandon, and in case Ronald
hesitated, he reserved the knowledge he possessed of
her private fortune as a final stimulus to his flagging
affections. Hitherto it had not seemed necessary to
acquaint his friend with the fact that Sybil had an
income of some thirty thousand dollars yearly&ndash;indeed,
no one seemed to know it, and she was supposed to
be in rather straitened circumstances.</p>

<p>As for his own chances with Joe, he had carefully
hidden the tracks of his journalistic doings in the
way he had at once proposed to himself when Joe attacked
him on the subject. A gentleman had been found upon
whom he had fastened the authorship of the articles
in the public estimation, and the gentleman would
live and die with the reputation for writing he had
thus unexpectedly obtained. He had ascertained beyond
a doubt that Joe knew nothing of his interview with
Ballymolloy, and he felt himself in a strong position.</p>

<p>Pocock Vancouver had for years taken an infinite amount
of pains in planning and furthering his matrimonial
schemes. He was fond of money; but in a slightly less
degree he was fond of all that is beautiful and intelligent
in woman; so that his efforts to obtain for himself
what he considered a perfect combination of wit, good
looks, and money, although ineffectual, had occupied
a great deal of his spare time very agreeably.</p>

<h1>Chapter XX.</h1>

<p>Sherwood was a very old place. It had been built a
hundred years at least before the Revolution in the
days when the States had English governors, and when
its founder had been governor of Rhode Island. His
last descendant in the direct line was Sybil Brandon&rsquo;s
great-uncle.</p>

<p>The old country-seat was remarkable chiefly for the
extent of the gardens attached to the house, and for
the singularly advanced state of dilapidation in which
everything was allowed to remain. Beyond the gardens
the woods stretched down to the sea, unpruned and thick
with a heavy undergrowth; from the road the gardens
were hidden by thick hedges, and by the forbidding
gray front of the building. It was not an attractive
place to look at, and once within the precincts there
was a heavy sense of loneliness and utter desolation,
that seemed to fit it for the very home of melancholy.</p>

<p>The damp sea air had drawn green streaks of mould
downwards from each several jointing of the stones;
the long-closed shutters of some of the windows were
more than half hidden by creepers, bushy and straggling
by turns, and the eaves were all green with moss and
mould. From the deep-arched porch at the back a weed-grown
gravel walk led away through untrimmed hedges of box
and myrtle to an ancient summer-house on the edge
of a steep slope of grass. To right and left of this
path, the rose-trees and box that had once marked
the gayest of flower gardens now grew in such exuberance
of wild profusion that it would have needed strong
arms and a sharp axe to cut a way through. Far away
on a wooded knoll above the sea was the old graveyard,
where generations of Sherwoods lay dead in their quiet
rest, side by side.</p>

<p>But for a space in every year the desolation was touched
with the breath of life, and the sweet June air blew
away the mould and the smell of death, and the wild
flowers and roses sprang up joyfully in the wilderness
to greet the song-birds and the butterflies of summer.
And in this copious year a double spring had come
to Sherwood, for Sybil Brandon had arrived one day,
and her soft eyes and golden hair had banished all
sadness and shadow from the old place. Even the thin
old man, who lived there among the ghosts and shadows
of the dead and dying past, smoothed the wrinkles
from his forehead, forgetting to long selfishly for
his own death, when Sybil came; and with touching
thoughtfulness he strove to amuse her, and to be younger
for her sake. He found old garments of a gayer time,
full thirty years hidden away in the great wardrobes
up-stairs, and he put them on and wore them, though
they hung loosely about his shaken and withered frame,
lest he should be too sad a thing for such young eyes
to look upon.</p>

<p>Then Ronald came one day, and the old man took kindly
to him, and bade him come often. In the innocence
of his old age it seemed good that what youth and
life there was in the world should come together; and
Ronald treated him with a deference and respect to
which he had long been unused. Moreover, Ronald accepted
the invitation given him and came as often as he pleased,
which, before long, meant every day. When he came in
the morning he generally stayed until the evening,
and when he came in the afternoon he always stayed
as long as Sybil would let him, and rode home late
through the misty June moonlight pondering on the happiness
the world had suddenly brought forth for him who had
supposed, but a few months ago, that all happiness
was at an end.</p>

<p>Six months had gone by since Ronald had first seen
Sybil, and he had changed in that time from boy to
man. Looking back through the past years he knew that
he was glad Joe had not married him, for the new purpose
of his new life was to love and marry Sybil Brandon.
There was no doubt in his mind as to what he would
do; the strong nature in him was at last roused, and
he was capable of anything in reason or without it
to get what he wanted.</p>

<p>Some one has said that an Englishman&rsquo;s idea
of happiness is to find something he can kill and
to hunt it. That is a metaphor as well as a fact.
It may take an Englishman half a lifetime to find out
what he wants, but when he is once decided he is very
likely to get it, or to die in the attempt. The American
is fond of trying everything until he reaches the
age at which Americans normally become dyspeptic, and
during his comparatively brief career he succeeds
in experiencing a surprising variety of sensations.
Both Americans and English are tenacious in their
different ways, and it is certain that between them
they have gotten more things that they have wanted
than any other existing nation.</p>

<p>What most surprised Ronald was that, having made up
his mind to marry Sybil, he should not have had the
opportunity, or perhaps the courage, to tell her so.
He remembered how easily he had always been able to
speak to Joe about matrimony, and he wondered why
it should be so hard to approach the subject with
one whom he loved infinitely more dearly than he had
ever loved his cousin. But love brings tact and the
knowledge of fitness, besides having the effect of
partially hiding the past and exaggerating the future
into an eternity of rose-colored happiness; wherefore
Ronald supposed that everything would come right in
time, and that the time for everything to come right
could not possibly be very far off.</p>

<p>On the day after he had seen Joe in Boston he rode
over to Sherwood in the morning, as usual, upon one
of Vancouver&rsquo;s horses. He was lighter at heart
than ever, for he had somewhat dreaded the revelation
of his intentions to Joe; but she had so led him on
and helped him that it had all seemed very easy. He
was not long in reaching his destination, and having
put his horse in the hands of the single man who did
duty as gardener, groom, and dairyman for old Mr.
Sherwood, he entered the garden, where he hoped to
meet Sybil alone. He was not disappointed, for as he
walked down the path through the wilderness of shrubbery
he caught sight of her near the summer-house, stooping
down in the act of plucking certain flowers that grew
there.</p>

<p>She, too, was dressed all in white, as he had seen
his cousin on the previous day; but the difference
struck him forcibly as he came up and took her outstretched
hand. They had changed places and character, one could
almost have thought. Joe had looked so tired and weary,
so &ldquo;wilted,&rdquo; as they say in Boston, that
it had shocked Ronald to see her. Sybil, who had formerly
been so pale and cold, now was the very incarnation
of life; delicate and exquisitely fine in every movement
and expression, but most thoroughly alive. The fresh
soft color seemed to float beneath the transparent
skin, and her deep eyes were full of light and laughter
and sunshine. Ronald&rsquo;s heart leaped in his breast
for love and pride as she greeted him, and his brow
turned hot and his hands cold in the confusion of
his happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been away again?&rdquo; she asked
presently, looking down at the wild white lilies which
she had been gathering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was in Boston yesterday,&rdquo; answered
Ronald, who had immediately begun to help in plucking
the flowers. &ldquo;I went to see Joe. She looks dreadfully
knocked up with the heat, poor child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they talked about Joe and Boston for a little
while, and Sybil sat upon the steps of the summer-house
on the side where there was shade from the hot morning
sun, while Ronald brought her handfuls of the white
lilies. At last there were enough, and he came and
stood before her. She was so radiantly lovely as she
sat in the warm shade with the still slanting sunlight
just falling over her white dress, he thought her so
super-humanly beautiful that he stood watching her
without thinking of speaking or caring that she should
speak to him. She looked up and smiled, a quick bright
smile, for she was woman enough to know his thoughts.
But she busied herself with the lilies and looked
down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; said Ronald suddenly,
kneeling down before her on the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can&ndash;very much,&rdquo;
said Sybil, demurely. &ldquo;You are not very clever
about flowers, you know. Oh, take care! You will crush
it&ndash; give it back to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald had taken one of the lilies and was smelling
it, but it looked to Sybil very much as though he
were pressing it to his lips. He would not give it
back, but held it away at arm&rsquo;s length as he
knelt. Sybil made as though she were annoyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I cannot
take it, if you will not give it to me.&rdquo; Ronald
gently laid the flower in her lap with the others.
She pretended to take no notice of what he did, but
went on composing her nosegay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Brandon&rdquo;&ndash;began Ronald, and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Sybil, without looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I tell you something?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said Sybil. &ldquo;Is
it anything very interesting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ronald. There seemed to be
something the matter with his throat all at once,
as though he were going to choke. Sybil looked up and
saw that he was very pale. She had never seen him otherwise
than ruddy before, and she was startled; she dropped
the lilies on her knees and looked at him anxiously.
Ronald suddenly laid his hands over hers and held
them. Still she faced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very unworthy of you&ndash;I know I am-but
I love you very, very much.&rdquo; He spoke distinctly
enough now, and slowly. He was as white as marble,
and his fingers were cold, and trembled as they held
hers.</p>

<p>For an instant after he had spoken, Sybil did not
move. Then she quietly drew back her hands and hid
her face in a sudden, convulsive movement. She, too,
trembled, and her heart beat as though it would break;
but she said nothing. Ronald sprang from the ground
and kneeled again upon the step beside her; very gently
his arm stole about her and drew her to him. She took
one hand from her face and tried to disentangle his
hold, but he held her strongly, and whispered in her
ear,&ndash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sybil, I love you&ndash;do you love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil made a struggle to rise, but it was not a very
brave struggle, and in another moment she had fallen
into his arms and was sobbing out her whole love passionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ronald, you mu&ndash;must not!&rdquo; But Ronald
did.</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were still sitting side by
side on the steps, but the storm of uncertainty was
passed, and they had plighted their faith for better
and for worse, for this world and the next. Ronald
had foreseen the event, and had hoped for it as he
never had hoped for anything in his life; Sybil had
perhaps guessed it; at all events, now that the supreme
moment was over, they both felt that it was the natural
climax to all that had happened during the spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Sybil, quietly, &ldquo;that
we ought to tell my uncle at once. He is the only
relation I have in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course,&rdquo; said Ronald, holding
her hand. &ldquo;That is, you know, I think we might
tell him after lunch. Because I suppose it would not
be the right thing for me to stay all day after he
knows. Would it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Sybil. &ldquo;He must
know it soon, and you will come to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, and the next day, and the day after
that, and always,&rdquo; said Ronald, lovingly. &ldquo;But
he will not like it, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Sybil, again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am poor,&rdquo; said Ronald, quietly.
&ldquo;You know I am not rich at all, Sybil dearest.
We shall have to be very economical, and live on the
place in Scotland. But it is a very pretty place,&rdquo;
he added, reassuringly.</p>

<p>Sybil flushed a little. He did not know, then, that
she had a fortune of her own. It was a new pleasure.
She did not say anything for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind very much, dearest?&rdquo; asked
Ronald, doubtfully. &ldquo;Do you think it would bore
you dreadfully to live in the country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil hesitated before she answered. She hardly knew
whether to tell him or not, but at last she decided
it would be better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ronald,&rdquo; said she, smiling a little;
&ldquo;I like the country. But, you know, we can live
anywhere we please. I am rich, Ronald&ndash;you did not
know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ronald started slightly. It was indeed an unexpected
revelation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, I am so
glad for you. You will not miss anything, then. I
was so afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening Ronald telegraphed to Joe the news of
his engagement, and the next day he wrote her a long
letter, which was more remarkable for the redundant
passion expressed than for the literary merit of the
expression. It seemed far easier to write it since
he had seen her and talked with her about Sybil, not
because he felt in the least ashamed of having fallen
in love within six months of the dissolution of his
former engagement with Joe, but because it seemed
a terribly difficult thing to speak to any one about
Sybil. Ronald was very far from being poetical, or
in any way given to lofty and medieval reflections
of the chivalric sort, but he was a very honest fellow,
loving for the first time, and he understood that his
love was something more to be guarded and respected
than anything that had yet come into his life; wherefore
it seemed almost ungentlemanly to speak about it.</p>

<p>When Joe received the intelligence her satisfaction
knew no bounds, for although she had guessed that
the climax of the affair was not far off, she had
not expected it so very soon. Had she searched through
the whole of her acquaintance at home and in America
she could have found no one whom she considered more
fit to be Ronald&rsquo;s wife, and that alone was
enough to make her very happy; but the sensation of
freedom from all further responsibility to Ronald,
and the consciousness that every possible good result
had followed upon her action, added so much to her
pleasure in the matter, that for a time she utterly
forgot herself and her own troubles. She instantly
wrote a long and sympathetic letter to Ronald, and
another to Sybil.</p>

<p>Sybil replied at once, begging Joe to come and spend
a month at Sherwood, or as much time as she was able
to give.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you had best go,&rdquo; remarked Miss
Schenectady. &ldquo;It is getting pretty hot here,
and you look quite sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I am very well,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;but
I think I will go for a week or ten days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you find you are going to have a good
time, you can always stay, any way,&rdquo; replied
the old lady. &ldquo;I think if I were you I would
take some books and a Bible and a pair of old boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Schenectady did not smile, but Joe laughed outright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Bible and a pair of old boots!&rdquo; she
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; said her aunt. &ldquo;Old
Tom Sherwood cannot have seen a Bible for fifty years,
I expect, and it might sort of freshen him up.&rdquo;
The old lady&rsquo;s eye twinkled slightly and the
corners of her mouth twitched a little. &ldquo;As
for the old boots, if you conclude to go, you will
want them, for you will be right out in the country
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe laughed again, but she took her aunt&rsquo;s advice;
and on the following day she reached Newport, and
was met by Sybil and Ronald, who conveyed her to Sherwood
in a thing which Joe learned was called a &ldquo;carryall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, when Ronald was gone, the two
girls sat in an angle of the old walls, looking over
the sea to eastward. The glow of the setting sun behind
them touched them softly, and threw a rosy color upon
Joe&rsquo;s pale face, and gilded Sybil&rsquo;s bright
hair, hovering about her brows in a halo of radiant
glory. Joe looked at her and wondered at the change
love had wrought in so short a time. Sybil had once
seemed so cold and white that only a nun&rsquo;s veil
could be a fit thing to bind upon her saintly head;
but now the orange blossoms would look better there,
Joe thought, twined in a bride&rsquo;s wreath of white
and green, of purity and hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Snow Angel,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;the
sun has melted you at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me the story of the Snow Angel,&rdquo;
said Sybil, smiling. &ldquo;You once said that you
would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;as
well I can remember it. Mamma used to tell it to me
years and years ago, when I was quite a small thing.
It is a pretty story. Listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once on a time, far away in the north, there
lived an angel. She was very, very beautiful, and
all of the purest snow, quite white, her face and
her hands and her dress and her wings. She lived alone,
ever so far away, all through the long winter, in
a valley of beautiful snow, where the sun never shone
even in the summer. She was the most lovely angel that
ever was, but she was so cold that she could not fly
at all, and so she waited in the valley, always looking
southward and wishing with all her heart that the
sun would rise above the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes people passed, far down below, in
sledges, and she almost would have asked some one
of them to take her out of the valley. But once, when
she came near the track, a man came by and saw her,
and he was so dreadfully frightened that he almost
fell out of the sled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, too, the little angels, who were
young and curious, would fly down into the cold valley
and look at her and speak to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pretty angel,&rsquo; they would say,
&rsquo;why do you stay all alone in this dreary place?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They forgot me here,&rsquo; she used
to answer, &rsquo;and now I cannot fly until the sun
is over the hill. But I am very happy. It will soon
come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was too cold for the little angels, and
so they soon flew away and left her; and they began
to call her the Snow Angel among themselves, and some
of them said she was not real, but the other ones said
she must be, because she was so beautiful. She was
not unhappy, because angels never can be, you know;
only it seemed a long time to wait for the sun to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at last the sun heard of her, and the little
angels who had seen her told him it was a shame that
he should not rise high enough to warm her and help
her to fly. So, as he is big and good-natured and strong,
he said he would try, and would do his best; and on
midsummer&rsquo;s day he determined to make a great
effort. He shook himself, and pushed and struggled
very hard, and got hotter than he had ever been in
his whole life with his exertions, but at last, with
a great brave leap, he found himself so high that
he could see right down into the valley, and he saw
the Snow Angel standing there, and she was so beautiful
that he almost cried with joy. And then, as he looked,
he saw a very wonderful sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Snow Angel, all white and glistening, looked
up into the sun&rsquo;s face and stretched her arms
towards him and trembled all over; and as she felt
that he was come at last and had begun to warm her,
she thrust out her delicate long wings, and they gleamed
and shone and struck the cold clear air. Then the
least possible tinge of exquisite color came into her
face, and she opened her lips and sang for joy; and
presently, as she was singing, she rose straight upward
with a rushing sound, like a lark in the sunlight,
the whitest and purest and most beautiful angel that
ever flew in the sky. And her voice was so grand and
clear and ringing, that all the other angels stopped
in their songs to listen, and then sang with her in
joy because the Snow Angel was free at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the story mamma used to tell me, long
ago, and when I first saw you I thought of it, because
you were so cold and beautiful that you seemed all
made of snow. But now the sun is over the hill, Sybil
dear, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Joe,&rdquo; said Sybil, winding her arm
round her friend&rsquo;s neck and laying her face
close to hers, &ldquo;you are so nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun sank suddenly behind them, and all the eastern
water caught the purple glow. It was dark when the
two girls walked slowly back to the old house.</p>

<p>Joe stayed many days with Sybil at Sherwood, and the
days ran into weeks and the weeks to months as the
summer sped by. Ronald came and went daily, spending
long hours with Sybil in the garden, and growing more
manly and quiet in his happiness, while Sybil grew
ever fairer in the gradual perfecting of her beauty.
It was comforting to Joe to see them together, knowing
what honest hearts they were. She occupied herself
as she could with books and a few letters, but she
would often sit for hours in a deep chair under the
overhanging porch, where the untrimmed honeysuckle
waved in the summer breeze like a living curtain,
and the birds would come and swing themselves upon
its tendrils. But Joe&rsquo;s cheek was always pale,
and her heart weary with longing and with fighting
against the poor imprisoned love that no one must
ever guess.</p>

<h1>Chapter XXI.</h1>

<p>The wedding-day was fixed for the middle of August,
and the ceremony was to take place in Newport. It
is not an easy matter to arrange the marriage of two
young people neither of whom has father or mother,
though their subsequent happiness is not likely to
suffer much by the bereavement. It was agreed, however,
that Mrs. Wyndham, who was Sybil&rsquo;s oldest friend,
should come and stay at Sherwood until everything was
finished; and she answered the invitation by saying
she was &ldquo;perfectly wild to come,&rdquo;&ndash;and
she came at once. Uncle Tom Sherwood was a little confused
at the notion of having his house full of people;
but Sybil had been amusing herself by reorganizing
the place for some time back, and there is nothing
easier than to render a great old-fashioned country
mansion habitable for a few days in the summer, when
carpets are useless and smoking chimneys are not a
necessity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham said that Sam would come down for the
wedding and stay over the day, but that she expected
he was pretty busy just now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;you
know John Harrington has come home. We must send him
an invitation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three ladies were walking in the garden after
breakfast, hatless and armed with parasols. Joe started
slightly, but no one noticed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did he come&ndash;where has he been all this
time?&rdquo; asked Sybil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do not know. He came down to see Sam
the other day at our place. He seems to have taken
to business. They talked about the Monroe doctrine
and the Panama canal, and all kinds of things. Sam
says somebody has died and left him money. Anyway,
he seems a good deal interested in the canal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyndham chatted on, planning with Sybil the details
of the wedding. The breakfast was to be at Sherwood,
and there were not to be many people. Indeed, the
distance would keep many away, a fact for which no
one of those principally concerned was at all sorry.
John Harrington, sweltering in the heat of New York,
and busier than he had ever been in his life, received
an engraved card to the effect that Mr. Thomas Sherwood
requested the pleasure of Mr. Harrington&rsquo;s company
at the marriage of his grandniece, Miss Sybil Brandon,
to Mr. Ronald Surbiton, at Sherwood, on the 15th of
August. There was also a note from Mrs. Wyndham, saying
that she was staying at Sherwood, and that she hoped
John would be able to come.</p>

<p>John had, of course, heard of the engagement, but
he had not suspected that the wedding would take place
so soon. In spite of his business, however, he determined
to be present. A great change had come over his life
since he had bid Joe good-by six months earlier. He
had been called to London as he had expected, and
had arrived there to find that Z was dead, and that
he was to take his place in the council. The fiery
old man had died very suddenly, having worked almost
to his last hour, in spite of desperate illness; but
when it was suspected that his case was hopeless,
John Harrington was warned that he must be ready to
join the survivors at once.</p>

<p>In the great excitement, and amidst the constant labor
of his new position, the past seemed to sink away
to utter insignificance. His previous exertions, the
short sharp struggle for the senatorship ending in
defeat, the hopes and fears of ten years of a most
active life, were forgotten and despised in the realization
of what he had so long and so ardently desired, and
now at last he saw that his dreams were no impossibility,
and that his theories were not myths. But he knew also
that, with all his strength and devotion and energy,
he was as yet no match for the two men with whom he
had to do. Their vast experience of men and things
threw his own knowledge into the shade, and cool as
he was in emergencies, he recognized that the magnitude
of the matters they handled astonished and even startled
him more than he could have believed possible. Years
must elapse before he understood what seemed as plain
as the day to them, and he must fight many desperate
battles before he was their equal. But the determination
to devote his life wholly and honestly to the one
object for which a man should live had grown stronger
than ever. In his exalted view the ideal republic
assumed grand and noble proportions, and already overshadowed
the whole earth with the glory of honor and peace
and perfect justice. Before the advancing tide of a
spotless civilization, all poverty, all corruption
and filthiness, all crime, all war and corroding seeds
of discord were swept utterly away and washed from
the world, to leave only forever and ever the magnificent
harmony of nations and peoples, wherein none of those
vile, base, and wicked things should even be dreamed
of, or so much as remembered.</p>

<p>He thought of Joe sometimes, wondering rather vaguely
why she had acted as she had, and whether any other
motive than pure sympathy with his work had made her
resent so violently Vancouver&rsquo;s position towards
him. It was odd, he thought, that an English girl
should find such extreme interest in American political
doings, and then the scene in the dim sitting-room
during the ball came vividly back to his memory. It
was not in his nature to fancy that every woman who
was taken with a fit of coughing was in love with
him, but the conviction formed itself in his mind that
he might possibly have fallen in love with Joe if
things had been different. As it was, he had put away
such childish things, and meant to live out his years
of work, with their failure or success, without love
and without a wife. He would always be grateful to
Joe, but that would be all, and he would be glad to
see her whenever an opportunity offered, just as he
would be glad to see any other friend. In this frame
of mind he arrived in Newport on the morning of the
wedding, and reached the little church among the trees
just in time to witness the ceremony.</p>

<p>It was not different from other weddings, excepting
perhaps that the place where the High Church portion
of Newport elects to worship is probably smaller than
any other consecrated building in the world. Every
seat was crowded, and it was with difficulty that
John could find standing room just within the door.
The heat was intense, and the horses that stood waiting
in the avenue, sweated in the sun as they fought the
flies, and pawed the hard road in an agony of impatience.</p>

<p>Sybil was exquisitely lovely as she went by on old
Mr. Sherwood&rsquo;s arm. The old gentleman had consented
to assume a civilized garb for once in his life, and
looked pleased with his aged self, as well he might
be, seeing that the engagement had been made under
his roof. Then Ronald passed, paler than usual, but
certainly the handsomest man present, carrying himself
with a new dignity, as though he knew himself a better
man than ever in being found worthy of his beautiful
bride. It was soon over, and the crowd streamed out
after the bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Harrington, how are you?&rdquo; said
Vancouver, overtaking John as he turned into the road.
&ldquo;You had better get in with me and drive out.
I have not seen you for an age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John stood still and surveyed Vancouver with a curiously
calm air of absolute superiority.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; he answered civilly.
&ldquo;I have hired a carriage to take me there. I
dare say we shall meet. Good-morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John had been to Sherwood some years before, but he
was surprised at the change that had been wrought
in honor of the marriage. The place looked inhabited,
the windows were all open, and the paths had been weeded,
though Sybil had not allowed the wild shrubbery to
be pruned nor the box hedges to be trimmed. She loved
the pathless confusion of the old grounds, and most
of all she loved the dilapidated summer-house.</p>

<p>John shook hands with many people that he knew. Mrs.
Wyndham led him aside a little way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not just perfectly splendid?&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;They are so exactly suited to each
other. I feel as if I had done it all. You are not
at all enthusiastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;I
am very enthusiastic. It is the best thing that could
possibly have happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then go and do likewise,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Sam, laughing. Then she changed her tone. &ldquo;There
is a young lady here who will be very glad to see you.
Go and try and cheer her up a little, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young lady over there&ndash;close to Sybil-dressed
in white with roses. Don&rsquo;t you see? How stupid
you are! There&ndash;the second on the left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that is Miss Thorn?&rdquo;
exclaimed John in much surprise, and looking where
Mrs. Sam directed him. &ldquo;Good Heavens! How she
has changed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has changed a good deal,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Wyndham, looking at John&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly think I should have known her,&rdquo;
said John. &ldquo;She must have been very ill; what
has been the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The matter? Well, perhaps if you will go and
speak to her, you will see what the matter is,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Sam, enigmatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; John looked at his
companion in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean just exactly what I say. Go and talk
to her, and cheer her up a little.&rdquo; She dropped
her voice, and spoke close to Harrington&rsquo;s ear&ndash;&ldquo;No
one else in the world can,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>John&rsquo;s impulse was to answer Mrs. Wyndham sharply.
What possible right could she have to say such things?
It was extremely bad taste, if it was nothing worse,
even with an old friend like John. But he checked the
words on his lips and spoke coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not fair to say things like that about
any girl,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I will certainly
go and speak to her at once, and if you will be good
enough to watch, you will see that I am the most indifferent
of persons in her eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will watch,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyndham,
not in the least disconcerted. &ldquo;Only take care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John smiled quietly, and made his way through the
crowd of gaily-dressed, laughing people to here Joe
was standing. She had not yet caught sight of him,
but she knew he was in the room, and she felt very
nervous. She intended to treat him with friendly coolness,
as a protest against her conduct in former days.</p>

<p>Poor Joe! she was very miserable, but she had made
a brave effort. Her pale cheeks and darkened eyes
contrasted painfully with the roses she wore, and
her short nervous remarks to those who spoke to her
sounded very unlike her former self.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Thorn?&rdquo; John said,
very quietly. &ldquo;It is a long time since we met.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe put her small cold hand in his, and it trembled
so much that John noticed it. She turned her head
a little away from him, frightened now that he was
at last come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;it
is a long time.&rdquo; She felt herself turn red and
then pale, and as she looked away from John she met
Mrs. Wyndham&rsquo;s black eyes turned full upon her
in an inquiring way. She started as though she had
been caught in some wrong thing; but she was naturally
brave, and after the first shock she spoke to John
more naturally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We seem destined for festivities, Mr. Harrington,&rdquo;
she said, trying to laugh. &ldquo;We parted at a ball,
and we meet again at a wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is always more gay to meet than to part,&rdquo;
answered John. &ldquo;I think this is altogether one
of the gayest things I ever saw. What a splendid fellow
your cousin is. It does one good to see men like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ronald is very good-looking,&rdquo; said
Joe. &ldquo;I am so very glad, you do not know; and
he is so happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any man ought to be who marries such a woman,&rdquo;
said John. &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; he added with
a smile, &ldquo;Vancouver takes it all very comfortably,
does he not? I would like to know what he really feels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure that whatever it is, it is something
bad,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you hate him!&rdquo; exclaimed John with
a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;I do not hate him. But you ought to, Mr.
Harrington. I simply despise him, that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not hate him either,&rdquo; answered
John. &ldquo;I would not disturb my peace of mind
for the sake of hating any one. It is not worth while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one came and spoke to Joe, and John moved away
in the crowd, more disturbed in mind than he cared
to acknowledge. He had gone to Joe&rsquo;s side in
the firm conviction that Mrs. Wyndham was only making
an untimely jest, and that Joe would greet him indifferently.
Instead she had blushed, turned paler, hesitated in
her speech, and had shown every sign of confusion
and embarrassment. He knew that Mrs. Wyndham was right,
after all, and he avoided her, not wishing to give
a fresh opportunity for making remarks upon Joe&rsquo;s
manner.</p>

<p>The breakfast progressed, and the people wandered
out into the garden from the hot rooms, seeking some
coolness in the shady walks. By some chain of circumstances
which John could not explain, he found himself left
alone with Joe an hour after he had first met her
in the house. A little knot of acquaintances had gone
out to the end of one of the walks, where there was
a shady old bower, and presently they had paired off
and moved away in various directions, leaving John
and Joe together. The excitement had brought the faint
color to the girl&rsquo;s face at last, and she was
more than usually inclined to talk, partly from nervous
embarrassment, and partly from the enlivening effect
of so many faces she had not seen for so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, pulling a leaf from
the creepers and twisting it in her fingers&ndash;&ldquo;tell
me, how long was it before you forgot your disappointment
about the election? Or did you think it was not worth
while to disturb your peace of mind for anything so
trivial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could not help it,&rdquo; said
John. &ldquo;I was dreadfully depressed at first.
I told you so, do you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you were, and I was very sorry for
you. I told you you would lose it, long before, but
you do not seem to care in the least now. I do not
understand you at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I soon got over it,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I
left Boston on the day after I saw you, and went straight
to London. And then I found that a friend of mine
was dead, and I had so much to do that I forgot everything
that had gone before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe gave a little sigh, short and sharp, and quickly
checked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a great many friends, have you not?&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very many. A man cannot have too many
of the right sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think you and I mean the same thing
by friendship,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I should say
one cannot have too few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean friends who will help you at the right
moment, that is, when you ask help. Surely it must
be good to have many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything that you do and say always turns
to one and the same end,&rdquo; said Joe, a little
impatiently. &ldquo;The one thing you live for is power
and the hope of power. Is there nothing in the world
worth while save that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power itself is worth nothing. It is the thing
one means to get with it that is the real test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. But tell me, is anything you can
obtain by all the power the world holds better than
the simple happiness of natural people, who are born
and live good lives, and&ndash;fall in love, and marry,
and that sort of thing, and are happy, and die?&rdquo;
Joe looked down and turned the leaf she held in her
fingers, as she stated her proposition.</p>

<p>John Harrington paused before he answered. A moment
earlier he had been as calm and cold as he was wont
to be; now, he suddenly hesitated. The strong blood
rushed to his brain and beat furiously in his temples,
and then sank heavily back to his heart, leaving his
face very pale. His fingers wrung each other fiercely
for a moment. He looked away at the trees; he turned
to Josephine Thorn; and then once more he gazed at
the dark foliage, motionless in the hot air of the
summer&rsquo;s afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think there are
things much better than those in the world.&rdquo;
But his voice shook strangely, and there was no true
ring in it.</p>

<p>Joe sighed again.</p>

<p>In the distance she could see Ronald and Sybil, as
they stood under the porch shaking hands with the
departing guests. She looked at them, so radiant and
beautiful with the fulfilled joy of a perfect love,
and she looked at the stern, strong man by her side,
whose commanding face bore already the lines of care
and trouble, and who, he said, had found something
better than the happiness of yonder bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p>She sighed, and she said in her woman&rsquo;s heart
that they were right, and that John Harrington was
wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, rising, and her words
had a bitter tone, &ldquo;let us go in; it is late.&rdquo;
 John did not move. He sat like a stone, paler than
death, and said no word in answer. Joe turned and
looked at him, as though wondering why he did not
follow her. She was terrified at the expression in
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not coming?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly
going close to him and looking into his eyes.</p>

<h1>Chapter XXII.</h1>

<p>Joe was frightened; she stood and looked into Harrington&rsquo;s
eyes, doubting what she should do, not understanding
what was occurring. He looked so pale and strange
as he sat there, that she was terrified. She came a
step nearer to him, and tried to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Harrington?&rdquo;
she stammered. &ldquo;Speak&ndash;you frighten me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harrington looked at her for one moment more, and
then, without speaking, buried his face in his hands.
Joe clasped her hands to her side in a sudden pain;
her heart beat as though it would break, and the scene
swam round before her in the hot air. She tried to
move another step towards the bench, and her strength
almost failed her; she caught at the lattice of the
old summer-house, still pressing one hand to her breast.
The rotten slabs of the wood-work cracked under her
light weight. She breathed hard, and her face was
as pale as the shadows on driven snow; in another moment
she sank down upon the bench beside John, and sat there,
staring vacantly out at the sunlight. Harrington felt
her gentle presence close to him and at last looked
up; every feature of his strong face seemed changed
in the convulsive fight that rent his heart and soul
to their very depths; the enormous strength of his
cold and dominant nature rose with tremendous force
to meet and quell the tempest of his passion, and could
not; dark circles made heavy shadows under his deep-set
eyes, and his even lips, left colorless and white,
were strained upon his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God help me&ndash;I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all he said, but in his words the deep agony
of a mortal struggle rang strangely&ndash;the knell of
the old life and the birth-chime of the new. One by
one, the words he had never thought to speak fell from
his lips, distinctly; the oracle of the heart answered
the great question of fate in its own way.</p>

<p>Josephine Thorn sat by his side, her hands lying idly
in her lap, her thin white face pressing against the
old brown lattice, while a spray of the sweet honeysuckle
that climbed over the wood-work just touched her bright
brown hair. As John spoke she tried to lift her head
and struggled to put out her hand, but could not.</p>

<p>As the shadows steal at evening over the earth, softly
closing the flowers and touching them to sleep, silently
and lovingly, in the promise of a bright waking&ndash;so,
as she sat there, her eyelids drooped and the light
faded gently from her face, her lips parted a very
little, and with a soft-breathed sigh she sank into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>John Harrington was in no state to be surprised or
startled by anything that happened. He saw, indeed,
that she had fainted, but with the unerring instinct
of a great love he understood. With the tenderness
of his strength he put one arm about her, and drew
her to him till her fair head rested upon his shoulder,
and he looked into her face.</p>

<p>In a few moments he had passed completely from the
old life to a life which he had never believed possible,
but which had nevertheless been long present with
him. He knew it and felt it, quickly realizing that
for the first time since he could remember he was
wholly and perfectly happy. He was a man who had dreamed
of all that is noble and great for man to do, who
had consecrated his every hour and minute to the attainment
of his end; and though his aim was in itself a good
one, the undivided concentration which the pursuit
of it required had driven him into a state  outwardly
resembling extreme egotism. He had loved his own purposes
as he had loved nothing else, and as he had been persuaded
that he could love nothing else, in the whole world.
Now, suddenly, he knew his own heart.</p>

<p>There is something beyond mere greatness, beyond the
pursuit of even the highest worldly aims; there is
something which is not a means to the attainment of
happiness, which is happiness itself. It is an inner
sympathy of hearts and souls and minds, a perfect union
of all that is most worthy in the natures of man and
woman; it is a plant so sensitive that a breath of
unkindness will hurt it and blight its beauty, and
yet it is a tree so strong that neither time nor tempest
can overthrow it when it has taken root; and if you
would tear it out and destroy it, the place where
it grew is as deep and as wide as a grave. It is a
bond that is as soft as silk and as strong as death,
binding hearts, not hands; so long as it is not strained
a man will hardly know that he is bound, but if he
would break it he will spend his strength in vain and
suffer the pains of hell, for it is the very essence
and nature of a true love that it cannot be broken.</p>

<p>With such men as John Harrington love at first sight
is an utter impossibility. The strong dominant aspirations
that lead them are a light too brilliant to be outshone
by any sudden flash of hot passion. Love, when it
comes to them, is of slow growth, but enduring in the
same proportion as it is slow; identifying itself,
by degrees so small that a man himself is unconscious
of it, with the deepest feelings of the heart and
the highest workings of the intellect. It steals silently
into the soul in the guise of friendship, asking nothing
but loyal friendship in return; in the appearance
of kindness which asks but a little gratitude; in
the semblance of a calm and passionless trustfulness,
demanding only a like trust as its equivalent pledge,
a like faith as a gauge for its own, an equal measure
of charity for an equal; and so love builds himself
a temple of faith and charity, and trust and kindness,
and honest friendship, and rejoices exceedingly in
the whole goodness and strength and beauty of the
place where he will presently worship. When that day
comes he stands in the midst and kindles a strong clear
flame upon the altar, and the fire burns and leaps
and illuminates the whole temple of love, which is
indeed the holy of holies of the temple of life.</p>

<p>John Harrington, through five and thirty years of
his life, had believed that the patient labor of a
powerful intellect could suffice to a man, in its
results, for the attainment of all that humanity most
honors, even for the wise and unerring government
of humanity itself. To that end and in that belief
he had honestly given every energy he possessed, and
had sternly choked down every tendency he felt in
his inner nature toward a life less intellectual and
more full of sympathy for the affairs of individual
mankind. With him to be strong was to be cold&ndash;to be
warm was to be weak and subject to error; a supreme
devotion to his career and a supreme disdain of all
personal affections were the conditions of success
which he deemed foremostly necessary, and he had come
to an almost superstitious belief in the idea that
the love of woman is the destruction of the intellectual
man. Himself ready to sacrifice all he possessed, and
to spend his last strength in the struggle for an ideal,
he had nevertheless so identified his own person with
the object he strove to attain that he regarded all
the means he could possibly control with as much jealousy
as though he had been the most selfish of men. Friends
he looked upon as tools for his trade, and he valued
them not only in proportion to their honesty and loyalty
of heart, but also in the degree of their power and
intelligence. He sought no friendships which could
not help him, and relinquished none that could be
of service in the future.</p>

<p>But the world is not ruled by intellect, though it
is sometimes governed by brute force and yet more
brutal passions. The dominant power in the affairs
of men is the heart. Humanity is moved far more by
what it feels than by what it knows, and those who
would be rulers of men must before all things be men
themselves, and not merely highly finished intellectual
machines.</p>

<p>The guests were gone, no one had missed Harrington
and Joe, and Ronald and Sybil had gone into the house.
They sat side by side in the little bower at the end
of the long walk&ndash;Joe&rsquo;s fair head resting in
her unconsciousness upon John&rsquo;s shoulder. Presently
she stirred, and opening her eyes, looked up into
his face. She drew gently away from him, and a warm
blush spread quickly over her pale cheek; she glanced
down at her small white hands and they clasped each
other convulsively.</p>

<p>John looked at her; suddenly his gray eyes grew dark
and deep, and the mighty passion took all his strength
into its own, so that he trembled and turned pale
again. But the words failed him no longer now. He knew
in a moment all that he had to say, and he said it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not be angry with me, Miss Thorn,&rdquo;
he began, &ldquo;you must not think I am losing my
head. Let me tell you now&ndash;perhaps you will listen
to me. God knows, I am not worthy to say such things
to you, but I will try to be. It is soon said. I love
you; I can no more help loving you than I can help
breathing. You have utterly changed me, and saved me,
and made a life for me out of what was not life at
all. Do not think it is sudden&ndash;what is really to
last forever must take some time in growing. I never
knew till to-day-I honored you and would have done
everything in the world for you, and I was more grateful
to you than I ever was to any human being. But I thought
when we met we should be friends just as we always
were, and instead of that I know that this is the
great day of my life, and that my life with all that
it holds is yours now, for always, to do with as you
will. Pray hear me out, do not be afraid; no man ever
honored you as I honor you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe glanced quickly at him and then again looked down;
but the surging blood came and went in her face, coursing
madly in her pulses, every beat of her heart crying
gladness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is little enough I have to offer you,&rdquo;
said John, his voice growing unsteady in the great
effort to speak calmly. There was something almost
terrible in the strength of his rising passion. &ldquo;It
is little enough&ndash;my poor life, with its wretched
struggles after what is perhaps far too great for
me. But such as it is I offer it to you. Take it if
you will. Be my wife, and give me the right to do
all I do for your sake, and for your sake only.&rdquo;
He stretched out his hand and took hers, very gently,
but the strained sinews of his wrist trembled violently.
Josephine made no resistance, but she still looked
down and said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use me as you will,&rdquo; he continued almost
in a whisper. &ldquo;I will be all to you that man
ever was to a living woman. Do not say I have no right
to ask you for as much. I have this right, that I
love you beyond the love of other men, so truly and
wholly I love you; I will serve you so faithfully,
I will honor you so loyally that you will love me too.
Say the word, my beloved, say that it is not impossible!
I will wait&ndash;I will work&ndash;I will strive to be worthy
of you.&rdquo; He pressed his white lips to her white
hand, and tried to look into her eyes, but she turned
away from him. &ldquo;Will you not speak to me? Will
you not give to me some word&ndash;some hope? I can never
love you less, whatever you may answer me&ndash;yes or no&ndash;but
oh, if you knew the difference to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pale as death, John looked at Joe. She turned to him,
very white, and gazed into the dark gray depths of
his eyes, where the raging force of a transcendent
passion played so wildly; but she felt no fear, only
a mad longing to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me&ndash;for God&rsquo;s sake tell me,&rdquo;
John said in low, trembling tones, &ldquo;have I hurt
you? Is it too much that I ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For one moment there was silence as they gazed at
each other. Then with a passionate impulse Josephine
buried her face in her hands upon John&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is not that!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I
love you so much&ndash;I have loved you so long!&rdquo;</p>

<h1>Chapter XXIII.</h1>

<p>John Harrington and Josephine Thorn were married in
the autumn of that year, and six months later John
was elected to the Senate. With characteristic patience
he determined to await a favorable opportunity before
speaking at any length in the Capitol. He loved his
new life, and the instinct to take a leading part
was strong in him, but he knew too well the importance
of the first impression made by a long speech to thrust
himself forward until the right moment came.</p>

<p>It chanced that the presidential election took place
in that year, just a twelvemonth after John&rsquo;s
marriage, and the unusual occurrences that attended
the struggle gave him the chance he desired. Three
candidates were supported nearly equally by the East,
the West, and the South, and on opening the sealed
documents in the presence of the two houses, it was
found that no one of the three had obtained the majority
necessary to elect him. The country was in a state
of unparalleled agitation. The imminent danger was
that the non-election of the candidate from the West
would produce a secession of the Western States from
the Union, in the same way that a revolution was nearly
brought about in 1876, during the contest between
Mr. Hayes and Mr. Tilden.</p>

<p>In this position of affairs, the electors being unable
to agree upon any one of the three candidates, the
election was thrown into the hands of Congress, in
accordance with the clause of the Constitution which
provides that in such cases the House of Representatives
shall elect a president, each State having but one
vote.</p>

<p>Harrington had made many speeches in different parts
of the country during the election campaign, and had
attracted much attention by his calm good sense in
such excited times. There was consequently a manifest
desire among senators and representatives to hear
him speak in the Capitol, and upon the day when the
final election of the President took place he judged
that his opportunity had come. Josephine was in the
ladies&rsquo; gallery, and as John rose to his feet
he looked long and fixedly up to her, gathering more
strength to do well what he so much loved to do, from
gazing at her whom he loved better than power, or
fame, or any earthly thing. His eyes shone and his
cheek paled; his old life with all its energy and active
work was associated in his mind with failure, with
discontent, and with solitude; his new life, with
her by his side, was brilliant, happy, and successful.
He felt within him the strength to move thousands,
the faith in his cause and in his power to help it
which culminates in great deeds. His strong voice
rang out, clear and far-heard, as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;MR. PRESIDENT,&ndash;We are here to decide, on behalf
of our country, a great matter. Many of us, many more
who are scattered over the land, will look back upon
this day as one of the most important in our times,
and for their sakes as well as our own we are bound
to summon all our strength of intelligence and all
our calmness of judgment to aid us in our decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question in which a certain number of ourselves
are to become arbitrators is briefly this: Are we
to act on this occasion like partisans, straining
every nerve for the advantage of our several parties?
or are we to act like free men, exerting our united
forces in one harmonious body for the immediate good
of the whole country? The struggle may seem at first
sight to be a battle between the East, the West, and
the South. In sober earnest, it is a contest between
the changing principles of party politics on the one
hand and the undying principle of freedom on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need not make any long statement of the case
to you. We are here assembled to elect a President.
Our position is almost unprecedented in  the history
of the country. Instead of acquiescing in the declared
will of the people, our fellow-citizens, we are told
that the people&rsquo;s wish is divided, and we are
called upon to act spontaneously for the people, in
accordance with the constitution of our country. By
our individual and unhampered votes the life of the
country is to be determined for the next four years.
Let us not forget the vast responsibility that is upon
us. Let us join our hands and say to each other, &rsquo;We
are no longer Republicans, nor Democrats, nor Independents&ndash;we
are one party, the party of the Union, and there are
none against us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A partisan is not necessarily a man who asserts
a truth and defends it with his whole strength. A
partisan means one who takes up his position with
a party. There is a limit where a partisan becomes
an asserter of falsehood, and that limit is reached
when a man resigns his own principles into the judgment
of another, his conscience into another&rsquo;s keeping;
when a man gives up free thought, free judgment, and
free will in absolute and blind adherence to a set
of thoughts, judgments, and decisions over which he
exercises no control, and in the formation of which
he has but one voice in many millions. Every one remembers
the fable of the old man who, when dying, made his
sons break their staves one by one, and then bade
them bind a bundle of others together, and to try and
break them by one effort. In the uniting of individuals
in a party there is strength, but there must also
be complete unity. If the old man had bidden his sons
bind their staves in several bundles instead of in
one, the result would have been doubtful. That is
what party spirit makes men do. Party spirit is a
universal solvent; it is the great acid, the <i>aqua
fortis</i> of political alchemy, which eats through
bands of steel and corrodes pillars of iron in its
acrid virulence, till the whole engine of a nation&rsquo;s
government is crumbled and dissolved into a shapeless
and a worse than useless mass of broken metal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man is free, his will is free, his choice,
his judgments, his capacity for thought, and his power
to profit by it are all as free as air, just so long
as he remembers that they are his own&ndash;no longer. When
he forgets that he is his own master, absolutely and
entirely, he becomes another man&rsquo;s slave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The contest here is between political passion
roused to its fiercest pitch by the antagonism of
parties, and the universal liberty of opinion, which
we all say we possess, while so few of us dare honestly
exercise it. This passion, this political frenzy that
seizes men and whirls them in its eddies, is a most
singular compound of patriotism, of enthusiasm for
an individual, and of the personal hopes, fears, generosity,
and avarice of the individual who is enthusiastic.
It is a passion which, existing in others, can be
turned to account by the cool leader who does not possess
it, but which may too easily bring ruin upon the man
who is led.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The danger ahead is this same party spirit,
this wild and thoughtless frenzy in matters where
unbiased judgment is most of all necessary. It is
a rock upon which we have split before; it has taken
us many years to recover from the shock, and now we
are in danger of altogether losing our political life
upon the same reef. Unless we mend our course we inevitably
shall. Men forego every consideration of public honor
and private conscience for the sake of electing a
party candidate. The man at the helm of the party
ship has declared that he will sail due north, or south,
or east, or west, whatever happens, and his crew laugh
together and keep no lookout; they even feel a certain
pride in their leader, who thus defies the accidents
of nature for the sake of sailing in a fixed direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the result of all this? It is here
before us. The country is splitting into parties.
Three candidates are set up for the office of President.
Three distinct parties stand in the field, each one
vowing vengeance, secession, revolution, utter dismemberment
of the Union, unless its chosen champion is elected
to be chief of the Executive Department. Is this to
be the life of our Republic in future? Is this all
that so many millions of free citizens can do for
the public good and for public harmony? What shall
we gain by electing the candidate from the North, if
the defeated candidate from the South is determined
to produce a revolution; and if the disappointed candidate
from the West threatens to touch off the dry powder
and spring the mine of a great western secession?
Have we not seen all this before? Has not the bitter
cry of a nation&rsquo;s broken heart gone up to heaven
already in mortal agony for these very things to which
our uncontrollable political passions are hourly leading
us?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The contest is between political passion on
the one hand and universal liberty on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liberty in some countries is a kind of charade
word, an anagram, a symbol representing an imaginary
quantity, a password invented by unhappy men to express
all that they do not possess; a term meaning in the
minds of slaves a conglomerate of conditions so absurd,
of aspirations so futile, of imaginary delights so
fantastically unreasonable, that if the ideal state
of which the chained dreamers rave were realized but
for one moment, humanity would start in amazement
at the first glimpse of so much monstrosity, and by
and by would hold its sides with laughter at the folly
of its deluded fellows. In most countries where liberty
is talked of it is but a dream, and such a dream as
could only occur to the sickened fancy of a generation
of bondsmen. But it means something else with us. It
is here, in this country, in this capital, in this
hall, it is in the air we breathe, in the light we
see, in the strong, free pulses of our blood; it is
the heritage of men whose sires died for it, whose
fathers laid down all they had for it, of men whose
own veins have bled for it&ndash;and not in vain. In these
United States, liberty is a fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must decide quickly, then, between the conditions
of our liberty and the requirements of frantic political
passion. We must decide between peace and war, for
that is where the issue will come in the end. Between
freedom, prosperity, and peace on the one side, and
a civil war on the other; an alternative so horrible
and inhuman and hideous, that the very mention of
it makes brave men shiver in disgust at the memories
the word recalls. Do you think we are much further
from it now than we were in 1860? Do you think we
were far from it in 1876? It is a short step from
the threat to the deed when political passion is already
turning to bitter personal hate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In our times there is much talk of civilization
and culture. Two words define all that is necessary
to be known about them. Civilization is peace. The
uncivilized state of man is incessant war. Culture
is conscience, because conscience means the exercise
of honest judgment, and an ignorant people can form
no honest judgment of their own which can be exercised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a state of peace, educated and truthful
men judge fairly, and act sensibly on their decisions.
In other words, the majority is right and free. In
times of war and in times of great ignorance majorities
have rarely been either free or right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a bad sign of the times when education
increases and truth disappears. They ought to grow
together, for education means absolutely nothing but
the teaching and learning of what is true. If it does
not mean that, it means nothing. In some countries
the idea of truth is coexistent with the idea of destroying
all existing forms of belief. Some silly person recently
went so far as to raise the cry in this country, &rsquo;Separate
Church and State!&rsquo; If there is a country where
they are absolutely separated, it is ours; but let
the beliefs of mankind take care of themselves. I
dare say there will be Christians left in the world
even when Professor Huxley has written his last book,
and when Colonel Ingersoll has delivered his last
lecture. I am reminded of the Chinese philosopher
and political economist, who answered when he was asked
about religious matters: &rsquo;Do you understand
this world so well that you need occupy yourselves
with another?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The issue turns upon no such absurdities, neither
does it rest with any consideration of so-called platforms&ndash;free
trade, civil service, free navigation, tariff reform,
and all the rest of those things. The real issue is
between civilization and barbarism, between peace and
war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be warned in this great strait. I believe we
need few principles, but universal ones. I believe
in the republic because it was founded in simplicity,
and has been built up in strength by the strongest
of strong men; because its existence proves the greatest
truth with which we ever have to do, namely, that
men are born equal and free, although they may grow
up slaves to their evil passions, and become greater
or less according as they manfully put their hands
to the plough, or ignobly lie down and let themselves
be trampled upon. The battle of life is to the stronger,
but no man is so weak that he cannot raise himself
a little if he will, according to the abilities that
are born in him; and nowhere can he raise himself
so speedily and securely as on this free soil of ours.
Nowhere can he go so far without being molested; for
nowhere can man put himself so closely and trustfully
in the keeping of nature, certain that she will not
fail him, certain that she will yield him a thousand
fold for his labor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are indeed times in the history of a
great institution when it is just as well as necessary
to reconsider the principles upon which it is founded.
There are times in the life of a great nation when
it behooves her chief men to examine and see whether
the basis of her constitution is a sound one, and
whether she can continue to grow great without any
change in the fundamental conditions of her development.
It is a bad and a dangerous time for a growing nation,
but it is an almost inevitable stage in her life.
Thank God, that time is past with us! Let us not think
of the possibility of exposing ourselves again to
civil war as an alternative against retrogression
into barbarism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Civilization is peace, and to extend civilization
is to increase the security of property in the world&ndash;of
property and life and conscience. The natural and
barbarous state of man is that where the human animal
satisfies its cravings without any thought of consequences.
The cultivated state is that where humanity has ceased
to be merely animal, and considers the consequences
first and the cravings afterwards. Civilization unites
men so that they dwell together in harmony; to separate
them into parties that strive to annihilate each other
is to undo the work of civilization, to plunge the
state into civil war; to hew it in pieces, and split
it and tear it to shreds, till the magnificent body
of thinking beings, acting as one man for the public
good, is reduced to the miserable condition of a handful
of hostile tribes, whose very existence depends upon
successful robbery and well-timed violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Party spirit, so long as it is only a force
which binds together a number of men of honest purposes
and opinions, is a good thing, and it is by its means
that just and powerful majorities are formed and guided.
But where party spirit loses sight of the characters
of men, and judges them according as they are Republicans
or Democrats, instead of considering whether they
are good or bad citizens; when party spirit becomes
a machine for obtaining power by fair or foul means,
instead of a fixed principle for upholding the fair
against the foul&ndash;then there is great danger that
the majority itself is losing its liberty, and upon
the liberty of majorities depends ultimately the stability
and prosperity of the republic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider what is the history of the average
politician to-day, of the man  whose personal character
is as good as that of his neighbor, who has always
belonged to the same party, and who looks forward to
the hope of political distinction. Consider how he
has struggled through all manner of difficulties to
his present position, striving always to maintain good
relations with the chiefs of his party, while often
acknowledging in his heart that he would act differently
were his connection with those chiefs a matter of
less vital importance to himself. He probably will
tell you that his profession is politics. He has sacrificed
much to obtain his seat in Congress, or his position
in office, and he knows that henceforth he must live
by it or else begin life over again in another sphere.
At all events, for a term of years, his personal prosperity
depends upon the use he can make of his hold upon
the public goods. He is not individually to be blamed,
perhaps, for he follows a precedent as widely recognized
as it is universally pernicious. It is the system
that is to be blamed, the general belief that a man
can, and justly may, support himself by clinging to
a set of principles of which he does not honestly approve;
that he may earn his daily meal, since it comes to
that in the end, by doing jobs which in the free state
he would despise as unworthy, and by speaking boldly
in support of measures which he knows to be injurious
to the welfare of the country. That is the history,
the epitome of the ends and aims and manner of being
of the average politician in our day. He has ventured
into the waters of political life, and they have risen
around him till he must use all his strength in keeping
his head above them, though the torrent carry him
whither it will and whither he would not. There are
no compromises when a man is drowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many who are not in any such position.
There are men great and honest, and disinterested
in the highest sense of the word&ndash;men whose whole
lives prove it, whose whole record is one of honor
and truth, whose following consists of men they have
themselves chosen as their friends. We are not obliged
to select a drowning man for our President; we can
choose a man who stands on his own feet upon dry ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an old proverb which contains much
wisdom: &rsquo;Tell me who are your friends, and I
will tell you what you are.&rsquo; Is a man fit to
stand at the head of a community of men when he has
associated with a set of parasites, who live upon
his leavings, and will starve him if they can, in order
to enjoy his portion? Consider what is the position
of the President of the United States. Think what
vast power is placed in the hands of one man; what
vast interests of public and private good are at stake;
what an endless sequence of events and results of
events must follow upon the individual action of the
chief of the Executive Department; and remember how
free and untrammeled that individual action is. A people
who elect an officer to such a position need surely
to be cautious in their choice and circumspect in
their judgment of the man elected. They must satisfy
themselves about what he is likely to do by judging
honestly what he has done; they must know who are
his friends, his supporters, his advisers, in order
to judge of the friends he will make. They must take
into their consideration also the character of his
colleague, the vice-president, and the effect upon
the country and the country&rsquo;s relation with,
the world, should any disaster suddenly throw the
vice-president into office. We cannot afford to elect
a vice-president who would destroy the national credit
in a week, should the President himself be overtaken
by death. We must remember to count the cost of what
we are doing, not passing over one item because another
item seems just. We cannot overlook the future, nor
disregard the influence which our election has upon
the next; the steps which men, once in office, may
take in order to secure to themselves another term,
or to strengthen the position of the men whom they
desire to succeed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a word, we must put forth all our strength.
We must be cool, far-sighted, and impartial in such
times as these. And yet, how has this campaign been
hitherto conducted? Practically, by raising a party
cry; by exciting every species of evil passion of
which man is capable; by tickling the cupidity of
one man and flattering the ambitions of another; by
intimidating the weak, and groveling before the strong;
by every species of fawning sycophancy on the one
hand, and brutal overbearing bullying on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Party, party, party! A man would rather commit
a crime than vote against his party. The evil runs
through the country from East to West, from North
to South, eating at the nation&rsquo;s heartstrings,
gnawing at her sinews, and undermining her strength.
The time is coming, is even now come, when two or
three parties no longer suffice to express the disunion
of the Union. There are three to-day: to-morrow there
will be five, the next day ten, twenty, a hundred,
till every man&rsquo;s hand is against his fellow,
and his fellow&rsquo;s against him. The divisions
have grown so wide that the majority and the minority
are but the extremities of a countless set of internecine
majorities and minorities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Members of parties are bound no longer by the
honest determination to do the right, to choose the
right, and to uphold the right&ndash;they are bound by
fearful penalties to support their own man, were he
the very chiefest outcast of the earth, lest the man
of another party be elected in his place. The adverse
candidate is perhaps avowedly better fitted for the
office, a hundred times more honest, more experienced,
more worthy of respect. But he belongs to the enemy.
Down with him! let him perish in his honesty and righteousness!
There is no good in him, for he is a Democrat! There
is no good in him, for he is a Republican! He is a
scoundrel, for he is a Southerner! He is a thief,
for he is a Northerner! He is the prince of liars,
for he comes from the West! He is the scum of mankind,
for he is from the East! The people rage and rend
each other, and the frenzy grows apace with the hour,
till honor and justice, truth and manliness, are lost
together in the furious chaos of human elements. The
tortured airs of heaven howl out curses in a horrid
unison, this fair free soil of ours, dishonored and
befouled, moans beneath our feet in a dismal drone
of hopeless woe; there is no rock or cavern or ghostly
den of our mighty land but hisses back the echo of
some hideous curse, and hell itself is upon earth,
split and rent into multiplied hells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the ultimate expression of the senses of
these things is money. There is the chiefest disgrace.
We are not worse than the old nations, but we have
a right to be very much better; we have the obligation
to be better, the unchanging moral obligation which
lies upon every man to use the advantage he has. We
alone among nations are free, we alone among nations
inhabit a quarter of the world by ourselves, and live
and grow great in our own way with no thought of the
rest. Let us think more of living greatly than of
prosecuting greatness for the sake of its pecuniary
emoluments. Let us elect presidents who will give their
efforts to making us all great together, and not to
making some citizens rich at the expense of others
who are also citizens. A President can do much toward
either of these results, bad or good. He has the future
of the republic in his hands, as well as the present.
Let us be the richest among nations, since the course
of events makes us so, but let us not be the most sordid.
Let it never be said, in the land which has given
birth to the only true liberty the world has ever
seen, that liberty can be sold for a few dollars in
the market-place, and bartered against the promise
of four years of civil employment at a small salary!</p>

<p>&ldquo;This party spirit, this miserable craving for
the good things that may be extracted from the service
of a party, has produced the crying evil of our times.
A certain class&ndash;a very large class&ndash;call our politics
dirty, and our politicians dishonest. Young men whose
education and position in the commonwealth entitle
them to a voice in public matters withdraw entirely
from all contact with the real life of the country.
Liberty has become a leper, a blind outcast in the
eyes of the gilded youth of to-day. She sits apart
in ashes and in rags, and asks a little charity of
the richest of her children&ndash;a miserable mother despised
and cast out by her sons. They will not own her for
their mother, nor spare one crust to feed her from
their plenty. They pass by on the other side, staring
in admiration at the image they have set up for themselves&ndash;the
image of what they consider social excellence, an
idol compounded of decayed customs, and breathing
the poisonous emanations of a dead world, a monument
raised to the prejudices of former times, to the petty
thirst for aristocratic distinctions which they cherish
in their hearts, to their love of money, show, superficial
culture, and armorial bearings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly let them perish in the fruition of their
contemptible desires! Let them set up a thing called
society and worship it; let them lose themselves in
the contemplation of objects whose beauty they can
never appreciate save by counting the cost; let them
disgrace the names their honest fathers bore, by striving
to establish their descent from houses stained with
crime and denied with blood; let them disown their
fathers and spit in their mothers&rsquo; faces,&ndash;but
let them not call themselves free, nor give themselves
the airs of men. They toss their foolish heads in
scorn of all that a man holds truest and best. We can
afford to let them speak, if they please, even words
of contempt and dishonor; we can afford to let them
say that in laboring for our country we are groveling
in mud and defiling our hands with impurity; but we
cannot afford to let them steal our children from
us, nor to submit to the pestilent influence of their
corruption in our ranks. Those who would be of the
republic must labor for the public good, instead of
insolently asserting that there is no good in the
public on which they have fattened and thriven so well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All honor to those who have set their faces
against the growing evil, to check it if they can,
and to lay the foundation of a barrier against which
the tidal wave of corruption and dishonesty shall break
in vain. All praise to the brave men who might live
in the indolent lotus-eating atmosphere of wasteful
idleness, but who have put their hand to the wheel
of state, determined to bear all their might upon the
whirling spokes rather than see the good ship go to
pieces on the rock ahead. They have begun a good work,
and they have sown a good seed; they ask for no reward,
nor look for the reaping of the harvest. They mean
to do right, and they do it, because right is right,
not because they expect to be rewarded with the spoils
or fed with fat tit-bits from the feast of party. Upon
such men as these, be they rich or poor, we must rely.
The poor man can make sacrifices as great as the rich,
for he can forego for his country&rsquo;s sake, the
promise of ease and the hope of wealth as well as any
million-maker in the land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the tremendous issue now before us we are
called to decide upon the life of the country during
the next four years. We are chosen to direct the course
of a stream from its very source, and to turn it into
a channel where it will run smoothly to the end. For
the four years of an administration are like a river.
The water rises suddenly from the spring and flows
swiftly, ever increasing in volume as it is swollen
by tributaries and absorbs into itself other rivers
by the way. It may run smoothly in a fair stream,
moistening barren lands and softening the parched
desert into fertility; moving great engines of industry
with a ceaseless, even strength; bearing the burden
of a mighty and prosperous commerce on its broad bosom;
spreading plenty and refreshment through the wide
pastures by its banks, fed on its way by waters so
clear that at the last it merges untainted and unsullied
into the ocean, whence its limpid drops may again
be taken up and poured in soft, life-giving rain upon
the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in digging for a spring men may find suddenly
a torrent that they cannot control. It suddenly bursts
its bounds and banks, and rushes headlong down, carrying
everything before it in a resistless whirl of devastation,
tearing great trees up by the roots, crashing through
villages and towns and factories, girding the world
with a liquid tempest that sends the works of man
spinning down upon its dreadful course, till it plunges
into the abyss, a frantic chaos of indiscriminate destruction,
storm, and death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can any of us here present say that he will,
that he dare, take upon himself the responsibility
of electing a President from motives of party prejudice?
Having it in our power to agree upon the very best
man, would any of us remember this day without shame
if we disgraced those who trust us, by giving our
votes to a mere party candidate? The danger is great,
imminent, universal. We can save the country from it,
I would almost say from, death itself, by acting in
accordance with our honest convictions. Is any man
so despicable, so lost to honor, that in such a case
he will put aside the welfare of a nation for the
miserable sake of party popularity? Are we to stand
here in the guise and manner of free men, knowing
that we are driven together like a flock of sheep into
the fold by the howling of the wolves outside? Are
we to strut and plume ourselves upon our unhampered
freedom, while we act like slaves? Worse than slaves
we should be if we allowed one breath of party spirit,
one thought of party aggrandizement, to enter into
the choice we are about to make. Slaves are driven
to their work; shall we willingly let ourselves be
beaten into doing the dirty work of others by sacrificing
the nobility of our manhood? Do we meet here, like
paid gladiators of old, to cut each other&rsquo;s
throats in earnest while attacking and defending a
sham fortress, raised in the arena for the diversion
of those who set us on to the butchery and promise
to pay the survivors? Are we to provide a feast of
carrion for a flock of vultures and unclean beasts
of prey, when we need only stand together, and be
true to ourselves and to each other, to accomplish
one of the greatest acts in history? The vultures will
leave us alone unless we destroy each other; we need
not fear them. We are not slaves to be terrified into
compliance with evil, neither are we sheep that we
need huddle trembling together at the snarling of a
wolf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, indeed!&rdquo; were the words heard
on all sides in the audience, now thoroughly roused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not say, elect this candidate, or that
one. I am not canvassing for any candidate. It is
too late for that, even if it were seemly for me to
do so. I am canvassing for the cause of liberty against
slavery, as better men have done before me in this
very house. I am defending the reputation of unity
against the slanderous attack of disunion, against
the fearful peril of secession. I appeal to you, as
you are men, to act as men in this great crisis, to
put out your strong hands together and avert the overwhelming
disaster that threatens us; to stand side by side as
brothers,&ndash;for we are indeed brothers, children of
one father and one mother, heirs of such magnificent
heritage as has not fallen to the lot of mortality
before, co-heirs of freedom, and inheritors of the
free estate, five and fifty millions of free children,
born to our mother, the great republic, who bow the
knee to no man, and call no man master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loud applause greeted this part of the speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appeal from license to law, from division
to harmony, from the raging turmoil of angry and devouring
passion without to the calm serenity that reigns within
these walls. As we turn in horror and loathing from
the unbridled fury of human beings, changed almost
to beasts, so let us turn in hope and security to
those things we can honor and respect, to the dignity
of truth and the unbending strength of unquestioned
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appeal to you to make this day the greatest
in your lives, the most memorable in our history as
a nation. Lay aside this day the memories of the past,
and look forward to the brightness of the future. Throw
down the weapons of petty and murderous strife, and
join together in perfect harmony of mutual trust.
Be neither Republicans, nor Democrats, nor Independents.
Be what it is your greatest privilege to be&ndash;American
citizens. Cast parties to the winds, and uphold the
state. Trample under your free-born feet the badges
of party bondage, the ignoble chains of party slavery,
the wretched hopes of party preferment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Hear, hear! He is right!&rdquo; cried
many voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered John Harrington, in tones
that rose to the very roof of the vast building.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;&rsquo;Yes, by that blood our fathers shed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Union, in thy sacred cause,<br>
&nbsp;Whilst, streaming from the gallant dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sealed and sanctified thy laws.&rsquo;</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and strong hearts and strong hands will
hold their own; the promise of brave men will prevail,
and echoing down the avenues of time will strike grand
chords of harmony in the lives of our children and
children&rsquo;s children. So, in the far-off ages,
when hundreds of millions of our flesh and blood shall
fill this land, dwelling together in the glory of such
peace as no turmoil can trouble and no discontent disturb,
those men of the dim future will remember what we
swore to do, and what we did; and looking back, they
will say one to another: &rsquo;On that day our fathers
struck a mighty blow, and shattered and crushed and
trampled out all dissensions and all party strife
forever and ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choose, then, of your own heart and will a
man to be our President and our leader. Elect him
with one accord, and as you give your voices in the
choice, stand here together, knee to knee, shoulder
to shoulder, hand to hand; and let the mighty oath
go thundering up to heaven,</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smallcaps">This Union shall not be broken</span>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
