<p>CHAPTER I</p>

<p>HICKS&mdash;WILD WEST BAD MAN</p>

<p>  "Oh, a bold, bad man was Chuckwalla Bill&mdash;<br>
  An' he lived in a shanty on Tom-cat Hill;<br>
  Ten notches on the six-gun he toted on his hip&mdash;<br>
  For he'd sent ten buckos on the One-way Trip!"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, captain and full-back of the Bannister
College football<br>
squad, his behemoth bulk swathed in heavy blankets and crowded
into a<br>
narrow bunk, shifted his vast tonnage restlessly. He was dreaming
of the<br>
wild and woolly West, and like a six-reel Western drama thrown on
the<br>
screen in a moving-picture show, he visioned in his slumbers a
vivid and<br>
spectacular panorama.</p>

<p>The first lurid scene was the Deserted Limited held up at a
tank station in<br>
the great Mojave Desert by a lone, masked bandit who winged the
dreaming<br>
Butch in the shoulder, the latter being an express guard who
resisted.<br>
After the desperado, Two-Gun Steve, had forced the engineer to
run the<br>
train back to a siding, he had ordered Butch to vamoose. Quite
naturally,<br>
then, the collegian next found himself staggering across the arid
expanse,<br>
until at last, half dead from a burning thirst, seeking vainly
for a<br>
water-hole, the vast stretch of sandy, sagebrush-studded wastes
shimmered<br>
into a gorgeous ocean of sparkling blue waters. Then, as he
collapsed on<br>
the scorching-hot sand, helpless, the cool water so near,
suddenly the<br>
scene shifted.</p>

<p>In quick and vivid succession, Butch Brewster beheld a burning
stockade<br>
besieged by howling Indians, and a frontier town shot up by
recklessly<br>
riding cowboys on a jamboree. Then he became a tenderfoot,
badgered by<br>
yelling, shooting roisterers, and later a sheriff, bravely
leading his<br>
posse to a sensational battle with that same Two-Gun Steve and
his gang,<br>
entrenched in a rock-bound mountain defile.</p>

<p>Finally, he stood with hands above his head in company with
other<br>
passengers of the Sagebrush Stagecoach, while a huge, red-shirted
Westerner<br>
with a fierce black mustache and a six-shooter in each hand
belching<br>
bullets at Butch's dancing feet, roared out huskily:
"Oh&mdash;I'm a ring-tailed<br>
roarer (<i>bang-bang</i>)! I'm a rip-snortin', high-falutin',
loop-the-loopin'<br>
<i>bad</i> man (<i>bang-bang</i>)! I'm wild an' woolly, an' full
o' fleas, an' hard<br>
to curry below the knees&mdash;I'm a roarin' wild-cat, an' it's
my night to howl<br>
(<i>bang-bang</i>)! Yip-yip-yip-<i>yeee</i>!"</p>

<p>Big Butch, opening his eyes and starting up, gazed about him
in sheer<br>
surprise; for an instant, in that state of bewilderment that
comes with<br>
sudden awakening, he almost believed himself in a Western ranch
bunkhouse,<br>
and that some happy cowboy outside roared a grotesque ballad. He
gazed at<br>
the interior of a rough shack built of pine boards, with bunks
constructed<br>
in tiers on both sides. There were figures in them&mdash;Western
cowboys,<br>
perhaps. Then it seemed, somehow, that the voice drifting from
the outside<br>
was strangely familiar. Back at Bannister College, where he
remembered he<br>
had gone in the dim and dusty past, he had often heard that same
fog-horn<br>
voice, roaring songs of a less blood-curdling character, and
accompanied by<br>
that same banjo twanging, which tortured the campus, and bothered
would-be<br>
studious youths!</p>

<p>"I'm not in a moving-picture show," Butch informed himself, as
he donned<br>
khaki trousers, football sweater, and heavy shoes. "I'm not on a
Western<br>
ranch, either. I'm in the sleep-shack of Camp Bannister, the
football<br>
training-camp of the Bannister College squad! Those fellows in
the bunks<br>
are not cowboys, Indians, and bandits&mdash;they are my
teammates! I did dream<br>
stuff that would shame a Wild West scenario, but I understand it
all<br>
now&mdash;my dreams were influenced by T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr.!"</p>

<p>At that dramatic moment, to substantiate his statement, the
raucous voice,<br>
accompanied by resounding chords strummed on a banjo, sounded
again. The<br>
vocal and instrumental chaos was frequently punctured by revolver
reports,<br>
as the torturesome Caruso outside roared:</p>

<p>  "Oh, Chuckwalla Bill thought life was sweet&mdash;<br>
  Till he met up with Sure-shot Pete;<br>
  A hotter shootin' match Last Chance never saw&mdash;<br>
  But Sure-shot Pete was some quicker on the draw!"</p>

<p>The pachydermic Butch, fully dressed&mdash;and awake, raging
in his wrath like<br>
an active volcano, glanced at his watch, and discovered that it
was exactly<br>
five A.M.! Intensely pacified by this knowledge, he lumbered
toward the<br>
bunkhouse door and flung it open, determined to crush the
pestersome youth<br>
who thus unfeelingly disturbed the quietude of Camp Bannister at
such an<br>
unearthly hour! However, his grim purpose was temporarily
thwarted&mdash;before<br>
him spread a beautiful panorama, a vast canvas painted in rich
hues and<br>
colors, that indescribably charming masterpiece of nature,
entitled dawn.</p>

<p>Butch, gazing from the bunkhouse doorway toward the pebbly
shore of the<br>
placid lake stretching out for two miles before him, beheld Old
Sol,<br>
blood-red, peeping above the wooded hills on the far-off,
opposite strand<br>
of Lake Conowingo; the luminous orb laid a flaming pathway across
the<br>
shimmering waters, and golden bars of light, like gleaming
fingers<br>
outstretched, fell athwart the tall pines that towered on the
high bluff<br>
back of the camp. The glorious sunshine, succeeding a flood of
rosy color,<br>
inundated the scene; it bathed in a gorgeous radiance the early
autumn<br>
woods, it illumined the bunkhouse, and another rude shanty known
to the<br>
squad as the grub-shack, it poured down on old Hinky-Dink, the
ancient<br>
negro cookee, setting the breakfast tables just outside the
canvas<br>
cook-tent.</p>

<p>"Deed, cross mah heart, Mistah Butch," grinned old Hinky-Dink,
seeing, as<br>
a motion picture director would express it, "Wrath registered on
the<br>
countenance" of Butch Brewster, "Ah done tole dat young Hicks dat
a bird<br>
what cain't sing an' will sing mus' be made <i>not</i> to sing!
Ah done info'med<br>
him dat yo'-all was layin' fo' him, cause he done bus' up yo'
sleep!"</p>

<p>A jay bird, a flashing bit of vivid blue, shot from a tall
pine, jeering<br>
shrilly at Butch; out on the lake, a trout leaped above the water
for an<br>
infinitesimal second, its shining scales gleaming in the
sunshine. From the<br>
cook-tent, where old Hinky-Dink grumbled at the frying pan, the
appetizing<br>
odor of frying fish assailed the football captain, softening his
wrath.</p>

<p>High above the shanties, on a tall flagpole made from a
straight young<br>
pine, floated a big gold and green banner, its bright colors
gleaming in<br>
the sunshine; it bore the words:</p>

<p>    CAMP BANNISTER<br>
    TRAINING CAMP<br>
    THE FOOTBALL SQUAD<br>
    BANNISTER COLLEGE</p>

<p>Head Coach Corridan, smashing the precedent that had made
former Gold and<br>
Green squads have their training camp at Bannister College, had
brought<br>
the Varsity and second-string stars to this camp on the shore of
Lake<br>
Conowingo, in the Pennsylvania mountains. For two weeks, one of
which had<br>
passed, they were to train at Camp Bannister, until college
officially<br>
opened; swimming, hunting, cross-country runs, and a healthful
outdoor<br>
existence would give the athletes superb condition, and daily
scrimmages on<br>
the level field back of the bluff rounded out an eleven that
promised to be<br>
the strongest in Bannister history.</p>

<p>As big, good-natured Butch Brewster stood in the bunkhouse
doorway, his<br>
wrath at the pestiferous Hicks forgotten, in his rapture at the
glorious<br>
dawn, he saw something that showed why his dreams had been of the
wild<br>
West! The expression of indignation, however, yielded to one of
humorous<br>
affection, as he gazed toward the shore.</p>

<p>"I can't be angry with Hicks!" breathed Butch, beholding a
spectacle more<br>
impressive than dawn. "So, the irrepressible wretch has Coach
Corridan's<br>
revolvers, used in starting our training sprints, and a lot of
blank<br>
cartridges! He is giving an imitation of a Western bad man. No
wonder<br>
I dreamed of Indians, cowboys, and hold-ups; I'll have revenge on
the<br>
heartless villain, routing me out at five!"</p>

<p>He saw a massive rock, rising thirty feet in air, its sheer
walls scaled<br>
only by a rope-ladder the collegians had rigged up on one side.
Atop of<br>
"Lookout There!" as the campers humorously designated the rock,
roosted<br>
a youth who possessed the colossal structure of a splinter, and
whose<br>
cherubic countenance was decorated with a Cheshire cat grin.
Quite unaware<br>
that his riotous efforts had brought out the wrathful Butch
Brewster,<br>
the youthful narrator of Chuckwalla Bill's stormy career
continued his<br>
excessively noisy s&eacute;ance.</p>

<p>His costume was strictly in character with his song. He wore a
sombrero,<br>
picked up on his Exposition trip the past vacation, a lurid
red<br>
outing-shirt, and he had wrapped a blanket around each locomotive
limb to<br>
imitate a cowboy's chaps. Two revolvers suspended from a loosened
belt, &agrave;<br>
la wild West, and as Butch stared, the embryo Western bad man
twanged a<br>
banjo noisily, and roared the concluding stanza of his desperado
hero's<br>
history:</p>

<p>  "Said Chuckwalla Bill, 'Oh, boys, plant me<br>
  With my boots on&mdash;on the wide prair-eee'&mdash;<br>
  Where the coyotes howl, they planted Bill&mdash;<br>
  An' so far as I know, he's sleepin' there still!"</p>

<p>"Here they come," grinned Butch, hearing a tumult in the
bunkhouse, and<br>
a confused Babel of voices. "Hicks has awakened the camp. Now
watch the<br>
fellows wreak summary vengeance on his toothpick frame!"</p>

<p>From the sleep-shack, aroused at that weird hour by the clamor
of the<br>
irrepressible youth, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., tumbled others of
the squad,<br>
in varying stages of <i>d&eacute;shabille</i>; big Beef
McNaughton, right half-back,<br>
Roddy Perkins, the Titian-haired right-end, Pudge Langdon, a
ponderous<br>
tackle, and Monty Merriweather, a clean-cut, aggressive candidate
for left<br>
end. From within, other wrathy youths howled vociferous protests
at their<br>
tormentor:</p>

<p>"Stop that noise; put your muzzle on again,
Hicks!"&mdash;"Where's the fire?<br>
Say, Hicks, muffle your exhaust!"&mdash;"Say, Coach, must we
endure this day and<br>
night?"</p>

<p>The bunkhouse fairly erupted angry collegians, boiling out
like bees<br>
swarming from a disturbed hive; Hefty Hollingsworth, the
Herculean<br>
center-rush. Biff Pemberton, left half-back, Bunch Bingham, Tug
Cardiff,<br>
and Buster Brown, three huge last-year substitutes; second-string
players,<br>
Don Carterson, Cherub Challoner, Skeet Wigglesworth, and Scoop
Sawyer. A<br>
dozen others, from sheer laziness, hugged their bunks devotedly,
despite<br>
the terrific turmoil outside.</p>

<p>"It's a disgrace, a <i>howling</i> shame!" exploded Beef, his
elephantine frame<br>
swathed in blankets to conceal a lack of vestiture, "Last night,
until<br>
midnight, that graceless wretch roosted on 'Lookout There' and
because the<br>
glorious moonlight made him sentimental and slushy, he twanged
his banjo<br>
and warbled such mushy stuff as 'My Love is young and fair. My
Love has<br>
golden hair!' When does he expect us to sleep?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't!" explained Monty Merriweather, with succinct
lucidity,<br>
grinning at his comrades. "Say, fellows, you know how Hicks
dreads a cold<br>
shower-bath; well, some of you rage at him from the other side of
the rock,<br>
while I climb up the rope-ladder and close with him! Then some of
you<br>
prehistoric pachyderms ascend, and we'll chuck that pestersome
insect into<br>
the cold, cold lake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Done!" chuckled Butch Brewster, delightedly. So, while he,
Beef<br>
McNaughton, Hefty Hollingsworth, and others beguiled the jeering
Hicks,<br>
expressing in dynamic, red-hot sentences their exact opinions of
his<br>
perfidy, the athletic Monty imitated a mountain-scaling Italian
soldier.<br>
He climbed stealthily up the swaying rope-ladder; nearer and
nearer to the<br>
unsuspecting youth he crept, while the cherubic Hicks, to
tantalize the<br>
group below, again burst forth:</p>

<p>"Whoop-eee! I'm a bold, <i>bad</i> man (<i>bang-bang</i>)! I
got ten notches on my<br>
ole six-gun&mdash;I'm a <i>killer</i>. I wings a man before
breakfast every day! I<br>
got a private burying-ground, where I plants my victims
(<i>bang-bang</i>)!<br>
Yip-yip-yip-<i>yee</i>! Oh, I'm a&mdash;Ouch, Monty&mdash;leggo
me&mdash;Oh, I'll be<br>
good&mdash;why didn't I pull that rope-ladder up here? Don't bust
my banjo<br>
&mdash;don't let Butch get me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Monty Merriweather, reaching the flat top of the rock, had
courageously<br>
flung himself, without regard for the Bad Man's desperate record,
on the<br>
startled Hicks, whose first thought was for his beloved banjo.
While he<br>
held the blithesome tormentor helpless, Butch, Beef, and Roddy
Perkins<br>
climbed the rope-ladder, and the grinning youth was soon in their
clutches,<br>
while the collegians below, like a Roman, mob aroused by the
oratory of Mr.<br>
Mark Antony, howled for revenge:</p>

<p>"Bust the old banjo over his head, Butch!"&mdash;"Sing to him,
Beef&mdash;that's<br>
an <i>awful</i> revenge on Hicks!"&mdash;"Tie him to the
rock&mdash;make him miss his<br>
breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Hicks," growled Butch, eyeing his sunny comrade ominously,
"you ought to<br>
be tarred and feathered, and shot at sunrise! When Bannister
opens, you<br>
will be a Senior, and you'll disgrace '19's dignity! This is a
sample of<br>
what we have endured at college for three years, and the worst is
yet to<br>
come! You have committed the awful atrocity of awakening Camp
Bannister<br>
at five A. M. with your ridiculous imitation, of a Western
desperado. To<br>
dampen your ardor, we will chuck you into the cold
lake&mdash;just as you are!"</p>

<p>"Help! Assistance! Aid! Succor!" shouted the happy-go-lucky
Hicks, as the<br>
behemoth Butch and Beef seized him, swinging him aloft with
ludicrous ease,<br>
"Police! Fire! Murder! Take care of my banjo, Monty. Tell all the
fellows<br>
at old Bannister I died game, and plant Hair-Trigger Bill with
his boots<br>
on! Oooo, Beef, Butch, <i>have a heart</i>, that water is
<i>cold</i>!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., relieved of banjo and revolvers, but
his<br>
shadow-like structure still clad in shoes, trousers, with
imitation "chaps"<br>
and flamboyant red shirt, with his classic head still adorned
by<br>
the sombrero, was swung back and forth by the two bulky
football<br>
stars&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Three&mdash;Let him go!" shouted Butch Brewster, and like a
falling meteor,<br>
the splinter-like youth, who had already fallen from grace, shot
from the<br>
rock, head-first, disappearing with a spectacular splash in the
icy waters<br>
of Lake Conowingo. Knowing Hicks to be as much at home in the
water as a<br>
fish in an aquarium, the hilarious squad on shore prepared to
jeer his<br>
reappearance above the water; however, their program was
interrupted by<br>
old Hinky-Dink, who stood in the cook-tent doorway, belaboring a
dishpan<br>
lustily with a soup-ladle, and shouting:</p>

<p>"Breakfus' am served; fus' an' las' call fo' breakfus; all dem
what am late<br>
don't git no breakfus!"</p>

<p>"Breakfast!" exclaimed Monty Merriweather, who, with Roddy,
Butch, and<br>
Beef, remained on the rock, despite the summons of the Cookee.
"Hurry up,<br>
Hicks, I'm ravenous. Say, Butch, suppose all that Western regalia
makes him<br>
water-logged; he's a terribly long while down there! Didn't he
look like<br>
the hero in a moving-picture feature? We've given him the
water-cure, but<br>
he will do that same stunt over again. That sunny-souled Hicks is
simply<br>
Incorrigible!"</p>

<p>A second later, the grinning, cheery countenance of T.
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., shot above the water, and simultaneously with his
appearance, just as<br>
though he had been chanting below the surface, for the
entertainment of the<br>
finny denizens of Lake Conowingo, the irrepressible youth
roared:</p>

<p>  "A hotter shootin' match Last Chance never saw&mdash;<br>
  But Sure-Shot Pete was some quicker on the draw!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER II</p>

<p>"LEAVE IT TO HICKS"</p>

<p>Head Coach Patrick Henry Corridan, known to toil-tortured Gold
and Green<br>
football squads from time immemorial as "the Slave-Driver,"
Captain Butch<br>
Brewster, and serious Deacon Radford, the star Bannister
quarter-back,<br>
foregathered around a table in the Camp Bannister grub-shack.</p>

<p>It was ten-thirty of the morning whose dawn T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr., had<br>
blithesomely hailed with an impromptu musicale and saengerfest on
"Lookout<br>
There!" rock, and the football triumvirate were in togs. The
squad, over in<br>
the bunkhouse, noisily donned gridiron armor for the morning
practice, and<br>
the pestiferous Hicks was maintaining a mysterious silence,
somewhere.</p>

<p>This football trio, on whom rested the responsibility of
rounding out a<br>
winning Bannister eleven, vastly resembled a coterie of German
generals,<br>
back of the trenches, studying a war-map. Before them was spread
what<br>
seemed to be a large checker-board. It was a miniature gridiron,
with the<br>
chalk-marks painted in white; there were thumb-tacks stuck here
and there,<br>
some with flat tops painted green and gold, others, representing
the enemy,<br>
were solid red. The former had names printed on them, Butch,
Roddy,<br>
Beef, and so on. By sticking these on the board, the three
directors of<br>
Bannister's football destiny could work out new plays, and
originate<br>
possible winning lineups.</p>

<p>"We've just got to win the State Championship this season,
Coach!" declared<br>
Butch, banging the table emphatically, as he stated a
self-evident fact.<br>
"It's my last year for Old Bannister, and so with Beef and Pudge.
I'll give<br>
every ounce of strength I possess In every game, to make that
pennant float<br>
over Bannister Field!"</p>

<p>"Bannister <i>will</i> win it!" vowed the behemoth Beef, his
good-natured<br>
countenance grim, and his jaw set. "Not for five years has a Gold
and Green<br>
team won the Championship&mdash;not since the year before Butch
and I were<br>
Freshmen! We've got a splendid bunch of material to build a team
with,<br>
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Our biggest problem is this," spoke Coach Corridan, as with a
phenomenal<br>
display of strength he took Beef McNaughton between thumb and
forefinger<br>
and placed him on the field. "We must strengthen both line and
backfield,<br>
for we lost by graduation Babe McCabe, Heavy Hughes, and Jack
Merritt. Now,<br>
to replace that lost power&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then, from directly beneath the open window by which they
had<br>
gathered, like the midnight serenade of a romantic lover,
sounded<br>
the well-known foghorn voice of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., as to
the<br>
plunkety-plunk of a banjo accompaniment, he warbled
melodiously:</p>

<p>  "Gone are the days&mdash;I used to spend with
Car-o-li-nah!<br>
  She had the sunshine in her laughter
(<i>plunkety-plunk</i>)<br>
  Just like that state they named her after&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hicks!" announced Butch, stealthily approaching the window,
and<br>
beckoning his companions. "Easy&mdash;look at him, Deke, there he
is, Hicks,<br>
the irrepressible! We might as well attempt to stab a rhinocerous
to death<br>
with a humming-bird's feather, as to try and reform
<i>him</i>!"</p>

<p>Arrayed like a lily of the field, a model of sartorial
splendor, Hicks<br>
occupied a chair beneath the window, tilted back gracefully
against the<br>
side of the grub-shack. He had decked his splinter-structure with
a<br>
dazzling Palm Beach suit, and a glorious pink silk shirt, off-set
by a<br>
lurid scarf. A Panama hat decorated his head, white Oxfords and
flamboyant<br>
hosiery adorned his feet, while the inevitable Cheshire cat grin
beautified<br>
his cherubic countenance. A latest "best seller" was propped on
his knees,<br>
and as he perused its thrilling pages, he carelessly strummed his
beloved<br>
banjo, and in stentorian tones chanted a sentimental ballad:</p>

<p>  "Gone are the days&mdash;the golden days I'm dreaming
of,<br>
  I think I hear her softly calling (plunkety-plunk)<br>
  'Will you be back? Will you be back? (plunk-plunk)<br>
  Back to the Car-o-li-nah you love?'"(plunkety-plunk),</p>

<p>For three golden campus years T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., had
gayly pursued the<br>
even tenor (or <i>basso</i>, since he possessed a foghorn,
subterranean voice)<br>
of his Bannister career. He absolutely refused to take life
seriously, and<br>
he was forever arousing the wrath&mdash;mostly pretended, for no
one could be<br>
really angry with the genial youth&mdash;of his comrades, by
twanging his banjo<br>
and roaring out rollicking ballads at all hours. He was never so
happy<br>
as when entertaining a crowd of happy students in his cozy
quarters,<br>
or escorting a Hicks' Personally Conducted expedition downtown
for a<br>
Beef-Steak Bust, at his expense, at Jerry's, the rendezvous of
hungry<br>
collegians.</p>

<p>However, despite his butterfly existence, Hicks, possessed of
a<br>
scintillating mind, always set the scholastic pace for 1919, by
means of<br>
occasional study-sprints, as he characteristically called them.
But when it<br>
came to helping his beloved Dad realize a long-cherished ambition
to behold<br>
his only son and heir shatter Hicks, Sr.'s, celebrated athletic
records, it<br>
was a different story. T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., ever since he
committed<br>
the farcical <i>faux pas</i> of running the wrong way with the
pigskin in<br>
the Freshman-Sophomore football contest of his first year, had
been a<br>
super-colossal athletic joke at old Bannister.</p>

<p>His record to date, beside that reverse touchdown that won for
the<br>
Sophomores, consisted of scoring a home-run with the bases
congested, on a<br>
strike-out; of smashing hurdles and cross-bars on the track;
endangering<br>
his heedless career with the shot and hammer; and making a
ridiculous farce<br>
of every event he entered, to the vast hilarity of the students,
who, with<br>
the exception of Butch Brewster, had no idea his ridiculous
efforts were in<br>
earnest. In the high-jump, however, Hicks had given considerable
promise,<br>
which to date the grasshopper collegian had failed to keep.</p>

<p>Hicks, the lovable, impulsive, and irrepressible, with his
invariable sunny<br>
disposition, his generous nature, and his democratic, loyal
comradeship<br>
for everybody, was loved by old Bannister. The students forgave
him his<br>
pestersome ways, his frequent torturing of them with
banjo-twanging and<br>
rollicking ballads. His classmates idolized him, Juniors and
Sophomores<br>
were his true friends, and entering Freshmen always regarded
this<br>
happy-go-lucky youth as a demigod of the campus.</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, who was forever futilely lecturing the
heedless Hicks,<br>
thrust his head from the grub-shack window, fought down a grin,
and sternly<br>
arraigned his graceless comrade:</p>

<p>"Hicks, you frivolous, campus-cluttering, infinitesimal atom
of nothing,<br>
you labor under the insane delusion that college life is a
continuous<br>
vaudeville show. You absolutely refuse to take your Bannister
years<br>
seriously, you banjo-thumping, pillow-punishing,
campus-torturing<br>
nonentity. You will never grasp the splendid opportunities within
your<br>
reach! You have no ambition but to strum that banjo, roar
ridiculous songs,<br>
fuss up like a tailor's dummy, and pester your comrades, or drag
them down<br>
to Jerry's for the eats! You won't be earnest, you Human Cipher,
Before you<br>
entered Bannister, you formed your ideas and ideals of campus
life from<br>
colored posters, moving-pictures, magazine stories, and stage
dramas like<br>
'Brown of Harvard"; you have surely lived up, or down, to those
ideals,<br>
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Them's harsh words, Butch!" joyously responded the grinning
Hicks,<br>
unchastened, for he knew good Butch Brewster would not, for a
fortune, have<br>
him forsake his care-free nature. "Thou loyal comrade of my happy
campus<br>
years, what wouldst thou of me?&mdash;have me don sack-cloth and
ashes, strike<br>
'The Funeral March' on my golden lyre, and cry out in anguish,
'ai! ai!<br>
'Nay, nay, a couple of nays; college years are all too brief;
hence I<br>
shall, by my own original process, extract from them all the
sunshine and<br>
happiness possible, and by my wonderful musical and vocal powers,
bring joy<br>
to my colleagues, who&mdash;Ouch, Butch&mdash;look out for that
nail, you inhuman<br>
elephant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Big Butch, at that juncture of Hicks' monologue, had
effectively terminated<br>
it by leaning from the window, grasping his unsuspecting comrade
by the<br>
scruff of the neck, and dragging him over the window-ledge, into
the<br>
grub-shack, and the presence of Coach Corridan and Deacon
Radford.<br>
Strenuous objection was registered, both by the futilely
struggling Hicks,<br>
and a nail projecting from the sill, which caught in the Palm
Beach<br>
trousers and ripped a long rent in them; fortunately, Hicks'
anatomy<br>
escaped a similar fate.</p>

<p>"A ripping good move, eh-what?" chuckled Hicks, twisting like
a<br>
contortionist, to view the damage done his vestiture, "Hello,
what have we<br>
here?&mdash;the German field-map, by the Van Dyke beard of the
Prophet! I<br>
bring the Kaiser's order, ham and eggs, and a cup of coffee. No,
that's a<br>
mistake. General Hen Von Kluck, lead a brigade of submarines up
yon hill to<br>
thunder the Russian fort! Von Hindering-Bug, send a flock of
aeroplanes and<br>
Zeppelins to the Allied trenches, the enemy is shooting Russian
caviare<br>
at&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hicks," said Head Coach Corridan, smiling at Butch Brewster's
indignation,<br>
"you are such a wonder at solving perplexing problems by your
marvelous<br>
'inspirations,' suppose you turn the scintillating searchlight of
your<br>
colossal intellect upon the question that Bannister must solve,
to produce<br>
a championship eleven!"</p>

<p>It was T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, inveterate habit, whenever a
baffling<br>
situation, or what the French call an "<i>impasse</i>" presented
itself, to<br>
state with the utmost confidence, "Oh, just leave it to Hicks!"
On<br>
most occasions, when he made this remark, accompanied by a
swaggering<br>
braggadocio that never failed to make good Butch Brewster
wrathful, the<br>
happy-go-lucky youth possessed not the slightest idea of how the
problem<br>
was to be solved. He just uttered his rash promise, and then
trusted to his<br>
needed inspiration to illuminate a way out! And, as the Bannister
campus<br>
well knew, Hicks had solved more than one torturing question by
an<br>
inspiration that flashed on his intellect, when all hope of a
satisfactory<br>
solution seemed dead.</p>

<p>For example, in his Sophomore year, when the Freshman leader,
James<br>
Roderick Perkins, that same Titian-haired Roddy who was now a
bulwark at<br>
right end, became charged with a Napoleonic ambition, and
organized a<br>
Freshman Equal Rights campaign, paralyzing Bannister football by
refusing<br>
to allow Freshmen to try for athletic teams, unless their demands
were<br>
granted. Hicks, when his inspiration finally smote him, smashed
the<br>
Votes-for-Freshmen crusade, and quelled Roddy, Futilely racking
his brain<br>
for a counter-attack, having blithely told the troubled campus,
"Just leave<br>
it to Hicks," he had ceased to worry, and then the inspiration
had come, By<br>
The Big Brotherhood of Bannister giving the upper-classmen full
government<br>
over Freshmen, a scheme successfully carried through, the peril
had been<br>
thwarted.</p>

<p>"I got a letter from Dad yesterday," began Hicks, somewhat
irrelevantly,<br>
considering the Coach's remarks, "and he said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'&mdash;Inclosed find the check you wrote for,'" quoth Deacon
Radford,<br>
humorously. "'If you keep up this pace, I shall have to turn my
steel<br>
mills to producing war munitions, to pay your college bills.'
Say, Hicks,<br>
seriously, listen to our problem, and suggest what Coach Corridan
should<br>
do."</p>

<p>While Hicks' athletic powers were known to equal those of the
paralyzed<br>
oldest inhabitant of a Civil War Veterans' Home, the sunny youth
knew<br>
football thoroughly; often he originated plays that the team
worked out<br>
with success, and his suggestions were always weighed carefully
by the<br>
football directors. So, after he had adjusted his lurid scarf at
the<br>
correct angle, and gazed ruefully at his torn habiliments, the
sunshiny<br>
Senior seated himself at the table, before the "war-map," and
gave heed to<br>
the Coach.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<img alt="aw.jpg (100K)" src="aw.jpg" height="839" width="549">
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Here's the problem, Hicks," said the Slave-Driver, indicating
the<br>
Bannister eleven, represented by the gold and green topped
thumb-tacks.<br>
"From the line we lost Babe, a tackle, Heavy, a guard, and Jack
Merritt, a<br>
star end. Now, Monty Merriweather will hold down Jack's place O.
K.&mdash;l can<br>
shift Beef from right half to guard, and put Butch at right-half,
while<br>
Bunch Bingham can take care of Babe's old berth at tackle. But I
have no<br>
one to shoot in at full-back, when I shift Butch; you see, Hicks,
my plan<br>
is to build an eleven that can execute old-time, line-smashing
football,<br>
and up-to-date open play as well; I want fast ends and halves,
with a<br>
snappy quarter, and I have them; also, the backfield is heavy
enough for<br>
line-bucking, if I get my beefy full-back. I must have a big,
heavy, fast<br>
player, a giant who simply can't be stopped when he hits the
line. With<br>
Butch and Biff at halves, Deke at quarter. Roddy and Monty ends,
and my<br>
heavy line&mdash;why, a ponderous, irresistible Hercules at
full-back will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say!" grinned the irrepressible Hicks, as Coach Corridan
warmed up to<br>
his vision, "you don't want <i>much</i>, Coach! Why don't you ask
Ted Coy, the<br>
famous ex-Yale full-back, to give up his business and play the
position for<br>
you? Maybe you can persuade Charlie Brickley, a <i>fair</i> sort
of dropkicker,<br>
to quit coaching Hopkins, and kick a few goals for old Bannister!
I get<br>
you, Coach&mdash;you want a fellow about the size of the
Lusitania, made of<br>
structural steel, a Brobdingnagian Colossus who will guarantee to
advance<br>
the ball fifteen yards per rush, or money refunded!</p>

<p>"Why, Coach, while you are wanting things, just wish for a
chap who will<br>
play the entire game himself, taking the ball down the field,
while the<br>
rest of the team are pushed along in rolling-chairs, while
imbibing pink<br>
tea. Get a prodigy who will instill such terror into our rivals
that<br>
instead of playing the schedule, Bannister will simply arrange
with other<br>
teams to mark themselves down defeated, and then agree what the
scores<br>
shall be."</p>

<p>"I knew it!" growled Butch Brewster, glowering at the jocular
youth. "We<br>
should never have consulted him on this problem, for it is not
one within<br>
his power to solve, even though he performed the miracle of
talking<br>
seriously about it Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;" echoed Hicks, with pretended seriousness, "Coach,
you just hand me<br>
the blue-prints and specifications of said Gargantuan Hercules,
and I'll<br>
try to corrall just such a phenomenon as you desire. Never
hesitate to<br>
consult me on such important matters, for I am ever-ready to cast
aside my<br>
own multifarious duties, when my Alma Mater needs my mental
assistance,<br>
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hicks, are you <i>crazy</i>?" fleered Deacon Radford, moved
to excitement,<br>
despite his great faith in the versatile youth. "Full-backs like
that do<br>
not grow on trees; the only one I ever read of was Ole Skjarsen,
in<br>
George Fitch's 'Siwash College Stories,' and he was purely
fictitious. We<br>
know you have accomplished some great things by your
'inspirations,' but as<br>
for this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just leave it to Hicks" quoth the irrepressible youth,
swaggering toward<br>
the door with an affected nonchalant self-confidence that aroused
Butch to<br>
wrath, and vastly amused his companions. "I'll admit a human
juggernaut<br>
like Coach Corridan dreams of will be hard to round up, but, I'll
have an<br>
inspiration soon. Don't worry about your old eleven, your problem
will be<br>
solved, and you will have a team that can play fifty-seven
varieties of<br>
football. Raw revolver, my comrades."</p>

<p>When the graceless T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., had sauntered
gracefully out of<br>
the grub-shack, big Butch Brewster, almost exploding with
suppressed wrath,<br>
stared at Slave-Driver Corridan and staid Deacon Radford a full
minute;<br>
then he grinned,</p>

<p>"That&mdash;Hicks!" he murmured, struggling against a desire
to laugh. "What a<br>
ridiculous prophecy! 'Just leave it to Hicks!' Well, that means
the problem<br>
goes unsolved, for though I confess he <i>is</i> brilliant, and
his so-called<br>
'inspirations' have helped old Bannister; when it comes to
rushing out and<br>
lassoing a smashing. Herculean full-back&mdash;<i>bah</i>!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, when Coach Corridan and the Gold and Green
squad climbed<br>
the bluff to the field back of Camp Bannister, for morning signal
drill,<br>
their last memory was of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., arrayed in
radiant<br>
vestiture, his chair tilted against the bunkhouse&mdash;the
chords of the banjo,<br>
and his foghorn voice drifting to them on the warm September
air:</p>

<p>  "Oh, father and mother pay all the bills
(<i>plunk-plunk</i>)<br>
  And we have all the fun (<i>plunkety-plunk</i>)<br>
  With the money that we spend in college life!"</p>

<p>Two hours afterward, as a tired, perspiring squad scrambled
down the bluff,<br>
and made for the cool waters of Lake Conowingo, a mysterious
silence,<br>
like a mighty wave, literally surged toward them. Camp Bannister
seemed<br>
deserted, the sun was still shining, the birds sang as cheerily
as ever,<br>
but instinctively the collegians felt an indescribable
loneliness, a sense<br>
of tremendous loss.</p>

<p>"Hicks!" shouted Butch Brewster, loudly, his voice shattering
the<br>
stillness. "Hicks&mdash;ahoy! I say, Hicks&mdash;"</p>

<p>Old Hinky-Dink, a letter in his hand, hobbled from the
cook-tent toward<br>
them; like a sinister harbinger of evil he advanced, grinning
deprecatingly<br>
at the squad:</p>

<p>"Mistah Hicks am gone!" he announced importantly. "He done gib
me fo' bits<br>
to row him ober to de village, to cotch de noon 'spress fo'
Philadelphy!<br>
Heah am a letter what he lef'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, to whom the <i>billet-doux</i> was
addressed in T. Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr.'s, familiar scrawl, tore open the envelope, and while
the squad<br>
listened, he read aloud the message left by that sunny-souled
youth;</p>

<p>"DEAR BUTCH:</p>

<p>"Coach Corridan will have to use the alarm clock from now on!
I'm called<br>
away on business. See that my stuff gets to Bannister O.K. Stow
it in the<br>
room next to yours. I'll be back at college some time in the next
century.<br>
Give my <i>adieux</i> to Coach Corridan and the squad.</p>

<p>"Yours truthfully,</p>

<p>"T. HAVILAND HICKS, JR.</p>

<p>"P.S.: Tell Coach Corridan he should worry&mdash;<i>not</i>!
I'm hot on the trail of<br>
a fullback that will make Ted Coy at his coyest look like the
paralyzed<br>
inmate of an old man's home. Just leave it to Hicks!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER III</p>

<p>HICKS' PRODIGIOUS PRODIGY</p>

<p>  "Has anybody here seen our Hicks?<br>
  H-i-c-k-s!<br>
  Has anybody here seen our Hicks?<br>
  If you've seen him, answer, 'Yes!'<br>
  He's tall and slim, and he wears a grin,<br>
  And his banjo-thumping is a sin.<br>
  Has <i>anybody</i> here seen our Hicks&mdash;<br>
  Hicks&mdash;and his old banjo?"</p>

<p>Captain Butch Brewster, big Beef McNaughton, the Phillyloo
Bird&mdash;that<br>
flamingo-like Senior&mdash;and little Theophilus Opperdyke, the
timorous boner<br>
whom Bannister College called the "Human Encyclopedia," roosted
on the<br>
sacred Senior Fence, between the Gymnasium and the Administration
Building.<br>
A gloomy silence, like a somber mantle, enshrouded the four
members of '19,<br>
as they listened to a rollicking parody on, "Has Anybody Here
Seen Kelly?"<br>
chanted by some Juniors in Nordyke, with T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
as the<br>
object of solicitude. Nor did the melancholy youths respond to
the queries<br>
hurled down at them from the dormitories' windows:</p>

<p>"Say, Butch Brewster, where is that crazy Hicks?"</p>

<p>"Beef, ain't our Hicks a-comin' back here no more?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Phillyloo, any word from our Hicks yet?"</p>

<p>"Ahoy there, Theophilus, where is Hicks, the Missing?"</p>

<p>The seven-thirty study-hour bell was ringing, its mellow
chimes sounding<br>
from the Administration Building tower. From the windows of the
dormitories<br>
gleams of light shot athwart the darkness. Over in Creighton
Hall, the<br>
abode of Freshmen, a silence reigned, but in Smithson, where the
Sophomores<br>
roomed, Nordyke, home of the Juniors, and Bannister, haunt of the
solemn<br>
Seniors, pandemonium obtained. In these dorm. rooms and corridors
that<br>
night, just as in the class-rooms, or on the campus, and
Bannister Field<br>
that day, there was but one topic. Whenever two students met,
came the<br>
query inevitable:</p>

<p>"Where is Hicks? Isn't Hicks coming back this year?"</p>

<p>The Freshmen, bewildered, quite naturally, at the furore made
over<br>
one missing student, asked, "Who is Hicks?" Seeking information
from<br>
upper-classmen they received innumerable tales, in the nature of
Iliad<br>
and Odyssey, concerning T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.; they heard of his
campus<br>
exploits, such as his originating The Big Brotherhood of
Bannister, and<br>
they laughed, at recitals of his athletic fiascos. They were told
of his<br>
inevitably sunny nature, his loyal comradeship, his generous
disposition,<br>
and as a result, the Freshmen, too, became intensely interested
in the<br>
all-important campus problem: "Where is T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr.?"</p>

<p>Little Theophilus Opperdyke, whose big-rimmed spectacles, high
forehead,<br>
and bushy hair gave him an intensely owlish appearance,
sighed<br>
tremendously, stared solemnly at his class-mates, and became the
author of<br>
a most astounding statement: "I&mdash;I can't study," quavered
the "boner,"<br>
he whose tender devotion to his books was a campus tradition, and
whose<br>
loyalty to his firm friend, the blithesome Hicks, was as that of
Damon<br>
to Pythias, "I just <i>can't</i> care about my studies, without
Hicks here!<br>
Somehow, it&mdash;it doesn't seem like old times, on the
campus."</p>

<p>"I should say not!" ejaculated the Phillyloo Bird,
sepulchrally, his<br>
string-bean length draped with extreme decorative effect on the
Senior<br>
Fence, "Life at old Bannister without T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., is
about as<br>
interesting as 'The Annual Report of the Department of
Agriculture!'<br>
Prexy thought he started the college on its Marathon three days
ago, but<br>
Bannister will not be officially opened until Hicks stands by his
window<br>
some study-hour, twangs that old banjo, and shatters the campus
quietude<br>
with a ballad roared in his fog-horn voice!"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, enshrouded in melancholy, instinctively
gazed up at the<br>
windows of the room T. Haviland Hicks, Jr. had reserved on the
third floor<br>
of Bannister Hall, the Senior dorm., as if he fully expected to
behold<br>
the missing youth materialize. There, in lonely grandeur, waited
the<br>
sunny-souled Senior's vast aggregation of trunks, crates, and
packing<br>
boxes, together with Hicks' baggage brought down from Camp
Bannister. The<br>
bothersome banjo had disappeared at the same time the youthful
Caruso<br>
imitated the Arabs, folding his figurative tent, and stealing
away.</p>

<p>"It's a strange paradox," boomed Butch Brewster, finding that
no Hicks<br>
appeared at the window, "but for three years Bannister has
stormed at Hicks<br>
for bothering us during study-hour, or at midnight, with his
saengerfest,<br>
and now I'd give anything to see him up there, and to hear that
banjo, and<br>
his songs! It is just as if the sun doesn't shine on the campus,
when T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., is away!"</p>

<p>Bannister College had been running for three days "on one
cylinder," as<br>
the Phillyloo Bird quaintly phrased it, on account of the
gladsome Hicks'<br>
mysterious absence. Not a word had the Head Coach, Captain
Brewster, the<br>
football squad, or any of the collegians received from the
blithesome<br>
youth, since the <i>billet-doux</i> he left with old Hinky-Dink
at Camp<br>
Bannister. Old students, returning to the campus for another
golden year,<br>
invaded Hicks' room in Bannister, ready to enjoy the cozy den of
that<br>
jolly Senior, but they encountered silence and desolation. No one
had the<br>
slightest knowledge of where the cheery Hicks could be; they
missed his<br>
singing and banjo strumming, his pestersome ways, his cheerful
good nature,<br>
his cozy quarters always open house to all, and his Hicks'
Personally<br>
Conducted tours downtown to Jerry's for those celebrated
Beefsteak Busts.</p>

<p>A telegram to Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., in Pittsburgh,
sent by the<br>
worried Butch Brewster, had brought this concise response:</p>

<p>No knowledge of Thomas' whereabouts. He should be at
Bannister.</p>

<p>"Queer," reflected Beef McNaughton, shifting his bulk on the
protesting<br>
fence. "We know Hicks will be back, for all his luggage is stowed
away<br>
in his room, and we are sure he is giving us all this mystery
just for a<br>
joke&mdash;he dearly loves to arrange a sensational and dramatic
climax&mdash;but<br>
we just can't get used to his not being on the campus. When
Theophilus<br>
Opperdyke can't study, it's high time the S.O.S. signal was sent
to T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr."</p>

<p>"That is not the worst of it," growled Captain Butch Brewster,
his arm<br>
across little Theophilus' shoulders. "The football squad misses
Hicks,<br>
Beef. For the past two seasons he has sat at the training-table,
his<br>
invariable good-humor, his Cheshire cat grin, and his sunny ways
have kept<br>
the fellows in fine mental trim so they haven't worried over the
game. But<br>
now, just as soon as he left Camp Bannister, the barometer of
their spirits<br>
went down to zero and every meal at training-table is a funeral.
Coach<br>
Corridan can't inject any pep into the scrimmages, and he says if
Hicks<br>
doesn't return soon, Bannister's chances of the Championship are
gone."</p>

<p>"As Theophilus says," responded the gloomy Beef, "we just
can't get used<br>
to his not being here. We miss his good-nature, his sunny smile,
the jolly<br>
crowds in his cozy quarters&mdash;why, the campus is talking of
nothing but<br>
Hicks&mdash;and I don't know what Bannister will do after Hicks
graduates&mdash;shut<br>
down, I suppose!"</p>

<p>"Well, you know," grinned the Phillyloo Bird, his cadaverous
structure<br>
humped over like a turkey on the roost, "our Hicks hath sallied
forth on<br>
the trail of a full-back, a Hercules who will smash the other
elevens to<br>
infinitesimal smithereens! He told the squad to just leave it to
Hicks,<br>
so don't be surprised if he is making flying trips to Yale,
Harvard, and<br>
Princeton, striving to corral some embryo Ted Coy. Remember how
Hicks often<br>
fulfills his rash prophecies!"</p>

<p>"A Herculean full-back&mdash;Bah!" fleered Butch, for all the
campus knew of<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, extremely rash vow to unearth a
"phenom." "The<br>
truth of it is, fellows. Hicks has failed to locate such a wonder
as Coach<br>
Corridac outlined, for there ain't no such animal! He doesn't
like to<br>
come back to Bannister without having made good his promise,
without that<br>
Gargantuan giant he vowed to round up for the Gold and
Green."</p>

<p>Just then, as if to substantiate Butch's jeering statement, a
youth wearing<br>
the uniform and cap of The Western Union Telegraph Company
and<br>
advancing across the campus at that terrific speed always
exhibited by<br>
messenger-boys, appeared in the offing. Periscoping the four
Seniors on the<br>
fence, he navigated his course accordingly and pulling a yellow
envelope<br>
from his cap, he queried, in charmingly chaste English:</p>

<p>"Say, kin youse tell me where to find a feller name o'
Brewster, wot's<br>
cap'n o' de football bunch?"</p>

<p>"Right here, Little Nemo," advised the Phillyloo Bird,
solemnly. "Hast thou<br>
any messages from New York for me? John D. Rockefeller promised
to wire me<br>
whether or not to purchase war-stocks."</p>

<p>The Phillyloo Bird, at this stage of his monologue, was
interrupted by a<br>
yell that would have caused a full-blooded Choctaw Indian to turn
pale.<br>
This came from good Butch Brewster, who, having signed for the
message,<br>
and imagined all manner of catastrophes, from world-wars,
earthquakes,<br>
pestilence and loss of wealth, down to bad news from Hicks, after
the<br>
fashion of those receiving telegrams but seldom, had scanned the
yellow<br>
slip. Never before, or afterward, not even when the luckless
Butch fell in<br>
love, and T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., assisted Cupid, did the
pachydermic Butch<br>
act so insanely as on this occasion.</p>

<p>"Whoop-<i>eee! Yee-ow! Wow-wow-wow</i>!" howled the supposedly
solemn Senior,<br>
tumbling from the Senior fence and rolling on the campus like a
decapitated<br>
rooster. "Hip-hip-<i>hooray</i>! Ring the bell, Beef, get the
fellows out, have<br>
the Band ready, Oh, where is Coach Corridan? Read it, Beef,
Theophilus,<br>
Phillyloo. Oh, Hicks is <i>coming</i> and he's got&mdash;"</p>

<p>It is possible that little Theophilus, who firmly believed
that big Butch<br>
Brewster had gone emotionally insane, would have fled for help,
but at that<br>
juncture members of the Gold and Green football squad, with Head
Coach<br>
Patrick Henry Corridan, appeared, marching funereally toward the
Gym.,<br>
where a signal quiz was booked for seven forty-five. Beholding
the<br>
paralyzing spectacle of their captain apparently in paroxysms on
the grass,<br>
Hefty Hollingsworth, Biff Pemberton, Monty Merriweather and Pudge
Langdon<br>
hurled themselves on his tonnage, while Roddy Perkins sat on his
head, and<br>
wrested the telegram from his grasp,</p>

<p>"Call up Matteawan," shouted Roddy, unfolding the slip, "Butch
is getting<br>
barmy in the dome, he&mdash;Oh, Coach, fellows&mdash;<i>great
joy</i>! Just heed."</p>

<p>James Roderick Perkins, as excited as a Senator about to make
his first<br>
speech, read aloud the telegram, on which the heedless Hicks had
triple<br>
rates:</p>

<p>"BUTCH:</p>

<p>"Coming 8.30 P. M. express today. Discharge entire
eleven&mdash;got whole team<br>
in one. Knock out partitions between five rooms. Make space for
Thor, the<br>
Prodigious Prodigy! Leave it to Hicks!</p>

<p>"T. HAVILAND HICKS, JR."</p>

<p>"Hicks is coming!" shrieked the Phillyloo Bird, soaring down
from the<br>
Senior Fence like a condor. "He will be here in less than an
hour; he sent<br>
this wire just before his train left Philadelphia. Money is no
object, when<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., wants to mystify old Bannister."</p>

<p>"'Discharge entire eleven,'" quoth Butch Brewster, having
somewhat subdued<br>
his frenzy. "'Got whole team in one&mdash;knock out partitions
between <i>five</i><br>
rooms&mdash;make space for Thor, the Prodigious Prodigy!' Now,
what in the world<br>
has that lunatical Hicks done? Who can Thor be?"</p>

<p>Tug Cardiff, Buster Brown, Bunch Bingham, Scoop Sawyer, little
Skeet<br>
Wigglesworth, Don Carterson, and Cherub Challoner, not having
given their<br>
brawn to the subduing of Butch, now kindly donated their brain,
in all<br>
manner of weird suggestions. According to their various surmises,
T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., had lured the Strong Man away from Barnum
and Bailey's<br>
Circus, had in some way reincarnated the mythical Norse god,
Thor, had<br>
hired some Greco-Roman wrestler, or by other devices too numerous
and<br>
ridiculous to mention, had produced a full-back according to
Coach<br>
Corridan's blue-prints and specifications.</p>

<p>Big Beef McNaughton, seized with an inspiration that
supplied<br>
locomotive-power to his huge frame, lumbered into the Gym., and
soon<br>
appeared with monster megaphones, used in "rooting" for Gold and
Green<br>
teams, which he handed out to his comrades. Then the riotous
squad, at his<br>
suggestion, sprinted for the Quad., that inner quadrangle or
court around<br>
which the four class dormitories, forming the sides of a square,
were<br>
built; anyone desiring an audience could be sure of it here,
since the<br>
collegians in all four dorms. could rush to the Quadrangle side
and look<br>
down from the windows. In the Quadrangle, under the brilliant
arc-lights,<br>
the exuberant youths paused,</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;let 'er go!" boomed Beef, and
the football squad, in<br>
<i>basso profundo</i>, aided by the Phillyloo Bird's uncertain
tenor, and<br>
Theophilus' quavery treble, roared in a tremendous vocal
explosion that<br>
shook the dormitories:</p>

<p>"Hicks is coming! Hicks is coming! Everybody out on the
campus! Get ready<br>
to welcome our T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.! Hicks is bringing
Bannister's<br>
full-back&mdash;a Prodigious Prodigy!"</p>

<p>Windows rattled up, heads were thrust out, a fusillade of
questions<br>
bombarded the squad in the Quadrangle below; from the three
upper-class<br>
dormitories erupted hordes of howling, shouting youths, and soon
the Quad.<br>
was filled with a singing, yelling, madly happy crowd. The
Bannister Band,<br>
that famous campus musical organization, following a time-honored
habit of<br>
playing on every possible occasion, gladsomely tuned up and soon
the<br>
noise was deafening, while study-hour, as prescribed by the
Faculty, was<br>
forgotten.</p>

<p>"Everybody on the campus, at once!" Butch Brewster,
Master-of-Ceremonies,<br>
boomed through his megaphone, having aroused excitement to the
highest<br>
pitch by reading Hicks' telegram. "Old Dan Flannagan's jitney-bus
will soon<br>
heave into sight. Let the Band blare, make a <i>big noise</i>.
Let's show Hicks<br>
how glad we are to have him back to old Bannister."</p>

<p>It is historically certain that Mr. Napoleon Bonaparte
returning from Jena<br>
and Austerlitz, Mr. Julius Caesar, home at Rome from his
Conquests, or Mr.<br>
Alexander the Great (Conqueror, not National League pitcher)
never received<br>
such a welcome as did T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., from his Bannister
comrades<br>
that night. To the excited students, massed on the campus before
the Gym.<br>
awaiting his arrival, every second seemed a century; everybody
talked at<br>
once until the hubbub rivaled that of a Woman's Suffrage
Convention. Thomas<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., was actually returning to old Bannister; and
he was<br>
bringing "The Prodigious Prodigy," whatever that was, with him.
Knowing the<br>
cheery Senior's intense love of doing the dramatic and his great
ambition<br>
to startle his Alma Mater with some sensational stunt, they could
hardly<br>
wait for old Dan Flannagan's jitney-bus to roll up the
driveway,</p>

<p>"Here he comes!" shrieked, little Skeet Wigglesworth, an
excitable Senior,<br>
who had climbed a tree to keep watch. "Here comes our Hicks!"</p>

<p>"Honk&mdash;Honk!" To the incessant blaring of a raucous horn,
old Dan<br>
Flannagan's jitney-bus moved up the driveway. The genial Irish
Jehu, who<br>
for over twenty years had transported Bannister collegians and
alumni<br>
to and from College Hill in a ramshackle hack drawn by Lord
Nelson, an<br>
antiquated, somnambulistic horse, had yielded to modern invention
at<br>
last. Lord Nelson having become defunct during vacation, Old Dan,
with<br>
a collection taken up by several alumni at Commencement, had
bought a<br>
battered Ford, and constructed therewith a jitney-bus. This
conveyance was<br>
fully as rattle-trap in appearance as the traditional hack had
been, but<br>
the returning collegians hailed it with glee.</p>

<p>"All hail Hicks!" howled Butch Brewster, beside himself with
joy,<br>
"Altogether&mdash;the Bannister yell for&mdash;Hicks!"</p>

<p>With half the collegians giving the yell, a number
shouting<br>
indiscriminately, the Bannister Band blaring furiously, "Behold,
The<br>
Conquering Hero Comes," with the youths a yelling, howling,
shrieking,<br>
dancing mass, old Dan Flannagan, adding his quota of noises with
the<br>
Claxon, brought his bus to a stop. This was a hilarious spectacle
in<br>
itself, for on its sides the Bannister students had painted:</p>

<p>HENRY FORD'S "PIECE-OF-A-SHIP," THE DOVE!<br>
ALL RIDING IN THIS JIT DO<br>
SO AT THEIR OWN RISK! TEN CENTS<br>
FOR A JOY-RIDE TO COLLEG HILL! YES,<br>
IT'S A FORD! WHAT DO YOU CARE? GET ABOARD!</p>

<p>On the roof of "The Dove," or "The Crab," as the collegians
called it when<br>
it skidded sideways, perched precariously that well-known,
beloved youth,<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr. He clutched his pestersome banjo and was
vigorously<br>
strumming the strings and apparently howling a ballad, lost in
the<br>
unearthly turmoil. As the jitney-bus stopped, the grinning Hicks
arose, and<br>
from his lofty, position made a profound bow.</p>

<p>"Speech! Speech! Speech!" A mighty shout arose, and Hicks
raised his hand<br>
for silence, which was immediately delivered to him.</p>

<p>"Fellows, one and all," he shouted, a mist before his eyes,
for his<br>
impulsive soul was touched by the ovation, "I&mdash;I am
<i>glad</i> to be back!<br>
Say&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I'm glad to be back&mdash;that's
all!"</p>

<p>At this masterly oration, which, despite its brevity,
contained volumes of<br>
feeling, the Bannister students went wild&mdash;for a longer
period than any<br>
political convention ever cheered a nominated candidate, they
cheered T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr.
"Roar&mdash;roar&mdash;roar&mdash;<i>roar</i>!" in deafening
sound-waves,<br>
the noise swept across the campus; never had football idol,
baseball hero,<br>
or any athletic demigod, in all Bannister's history, been
accorded such a<br>
tremendous ovation.</p>

<p>"Fellows," called T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., climbing down from
his precarious<br>
perch, "stand back; I have brought to Bannister the 'Prodigious
Prodigy.'<br>
I have rounded up a full-back who will beat Ballard all by
himself. Behold<br>
the new Gold and Green football eleven, 'Thor'!"</p>

<p>From the grinning Dan Flannagan's jitney-bus, like a Russian
bear charging<br>
from its den, lumbered a being whose enormous bulk fairly
astounded the<br>
speechless youths; Butch Brewster, Beef McNaughton, Tug Cardiff,
Bunch<br>
Bingham, Buster Brown, and Pudge Langdon were popularly regarded
as the<br>
last word in behemoths, but this "Thor" dwarfed them, towered
above them<br>
like a Colossus over Lilliputians. He was a youth, and yet a
veritable<br>
Hercules. Over six feet he stood, with a massive head, covered
with tousled<br>
white hair, a powerful neck, broad shoulders, a vast chest. To a
judge of<br>
athletes, he would tip the scales at a hundred and ninety pounds,
all solid<br>
muscle, for that superb physique held not an ounce of superfluous
flesh.</p>

<p>"Hicks," said Head Coach Patrick Henry Corridan, gazing at the
mountain of<br>
muscle, "if <i>size</i> means anything, you have brought old
Bannister an entire<br>
football squad! What splendid material to train for the Big
Games, why&mdash;he<br>
will be irresistible!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER IV</p>

<p>QUOTING SCOOP SAWYER'S LETTER</p>

<p>  "I didn't raise my Ford to be a <i>jitney</i>&mdash;<br>
  To run the streets, and stay out late at night!<br>
  Who dares to put a jitney sign, upon it&mdash;<br>
  And send my <i>peace-ship</i> out for fares to fight?"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., standing by his open window at 3 P. M.
one<br>
afternoon a week after his sensational return to Bannister
College, with<br>
the "Prodigious Prodigy" in tow, indulged in the soul-satisfying
pastime of<br>
twanging his banjo, and roaring, in his subterranean voice, a
parody on "I<br>
Didn't Raise My Boy to be a Soldier." It was actually the first
Caruso-like<br>
outburst of the pestersome youth that year, but his saengerfest
brought<br>
vociferous howls of protest from campus and dormitories:</p>

<p>"Bow-wow-wow! The Grand Opery season is starting!"</p>

<p>"Sing some records for a talking-machine company, Hicks!"</p>

<p>"Kill that tom-cat! Listen to the back-fence musicale!"</p>

<p>"Say, Hicks&mdash;we'll take your word for that noise!"</p>

<p>On the Gym. steps, loafing a few moments before jogging out to
Bannister<br>
Field for a strenuous scrimmage under the personal supervision
of<br>
Slave-Driver Corridan, the Gold and Green football squad had
gathered. It<br>
was from these stalwart gridiron gladiators that the caustic
criticism of<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, vocal atrocities emanated, and the
imitation of a<br>
mournful hound by "Ichabod," the skyscraping Senior, was indeed
phenomenal.<br>
Added to the howls, whistles, jeers, and shouts of the squad,
were like<br>
condemnations from other collegians, sky-larking on the campus,
or in the<br>
dorms.</p>

<p>"At that," grinned Captain Butch Brewster happily, "it surely
makes me feel<br>
jubilant to hear Hicks' foghorn voice shattering the echoes, with
his<br>
banjo strumming disturbing the peace&mdash;for which offense it
shall soon be<br>
arrested. We can truly say that old Bannister is now officially
opened for<br>
another year, for T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., has performed his
annual rite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;!" scoffed big Pudge Langdon, indignantly, as he
gazed up at the<br>
happy-go-lucky youth, at the window of his room on the
third-floor, campus<br>
side, of Bannister Hall, "Hicks ought to be tarred and feathered;
there is<br>
<i>nothing right</i> in the way he has acted since his return to
college! He<br>
struts around like Herman, the Master-Magician, and all the
fellows fully<br>
expect to see him produce white rabbits from his cap, or make
varicolored<br>
flags out of his handkerchief."</p>

<p>"We ought to toss him in a blanket," stormed Beef McNaughton,
in ludicrous<br>
rage. "Ever since he mystified Bannister by going out and
corralling a<br>
Hercules who is an entire eleven in himself, Hicks has maintained
that<br>
sphinx-like silence as to how he achieved the feat, and he
swaggers around,<br>
enshrouded in <i>mystery</i>! All we know is that 'Thor' is John
Thorwald, of<br>
Norwegian descent. If we ask <i>him</i> for information, that
wretch Hicks has<br>
him trained to say, 'Ask the little fellow, Hicks!'"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., in truth, had acted in a most
reprehensible manner<br>
since that memorable night when he brought "Thor, the Prodigious
Prodigy,"<br>
to the campus. Not that he ceased to be the same sunny-souled,
popular and<br>
friendly youth. The collegians, happy at finding his room
open-house again,<br>
flocked to his cozy quarters, Freshmen <i>fell</i> under the
spell of his<br>
generous nature, his Beef-Steak Busts, down at Jerry's were
nightly<br>
occurrences, and he was the same Hicks as of old. But, after the
dramatic<br>
manner in which Hicks had mysteriously made good the rash vow
uttered at<br>
Camp Bannister and had brought to Coach Corridan a blond-haired
giant who<br>
seemed destined to perform prodigies at full-back, the sunny
Senior had<br>
evidently labored under the delusion that he was "Kellar, The
Great<br>
Magician."</p>

<p>Instead of relieving the tortured curiosity of the students,
wild to know<br>
how and where Hicks had unearthed this physical Hercules, who in
every way<br>
filled the details of Head Coach Corridan's "blue-prints," T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., enjoying to the full this novel method of torturing
his<br>
comrades, made a baffling mystery of the affair, much to the
indignation of<br>
his friends.</p>

<p>"Just leave it to Hicks," he would say, when the Bannister
youths<br>
cajoled, implored, threatened, or argued. "Thor is eligible to
play four<br>
years of football at old Bannister. I call him Thor, after the
great Norse<br>
god, Thor; he is of Norwegian descent. That is all of the
Billion-Dollar<br>
Mystery I can disclose; ten thousand dollars offered for the
correct<br>
solution."</p>

<p>"Here comes Scoop Sawyer," said Monty Merriweather, as that
Senior, waving<br>
his arms in air, catapulted from Bannister Hall, and strode
toward the<br>
squad on the Gym. steps; his appearance registered wrath, in
photo-play<br>
parlance, and on reaching his comrades he immediately acquainted
them with<br>
its cause.</p>

<p>"Listen to that Hicks!" he exploded, gesticulating with a
sheaf of papers.<br>
"Hicks, the mocking-bird! He is mocking <i>us</i>&mdash;with his
'Billion-Dollar<br>
Mystery!' Say&mdash;here I am writing to Jack Merritt; he played
football four<br>
years for old Bannister; he was captain of the Gold and Green
eleven; last<br>
Commencement he graduated, and the last thing he said to me was,
'Scoop,<br>
old pal, write to me next fall, tell me everything about the
football<br>
season; keep me posted as to new material!' Everything&mdash;keep
him posted<br>
as to new material&mdash;Bah! If I write that Hicks has brought a
fellow he<br>
calls 'Thor,' who spreads the regulars over the field, Jack will
want<br>
to know the details, and&mdash;that villainous Hicks won't
divulge his dread<br>
secret!"</p>

<p>At this moment, Scoop Sawyer, so-called because he was
ambitious to be a<br>
newspaper reporter, after graduation, and for his humorous
articles in the<br>
Bannister Weekly, had his intense wrath soothed by that which
has<br>
"power to soothe the savage breast"; T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
displaying a<br>
wonderful originality by composing, then chanting, his parody,
concluded<br>
the chorus roaring lustily, to a rollicking banjo
accompaniment:</p>

<p>  "If street car companies gave seats to all patrons<br>
  The strap-hangers in jitneys would not ride.<br>
  There'd be no jits. today<br>
  If Ford owners would say,<br>
  I didn't raise my Ford to be a&mdash;jitney!"</p>

<p>"That is too much!" raged Captain Butch Brewster, facing his
excited<br>
colleagues. "Come on, fellows, we'll invade Hicks' room, read him
Scoop's<br>
letter to Jack Merritt, and <i>make</i> him solve the Mystery!
We're done with<br>
diplomacy; now, we'll deliver the ultimatum; when the squad
returns from<br>
scrimmage, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., will tell us all about Thor,
or be<br>
tossed in a blanket! Are you with me?"</p>

<p>"We are <i>ahead</i> of you!" howled Roddy Perkins, leading a
wild charge for<br>
the entrance to Bannister Hall. Following him up the two flights
of stairs<br>
with thunderous tread came Butch, Beef, Monty, Biff, Hefty,
Pudge, Tug,<br>
Ichabod, Bunch, Buster, Bus Norton, and several second-team
players,<br>
Cherub, Chub Chalmers, Don, Skeet, and Scoop Sawyer with his
letter. With<br>
a terrific, blood-chilling clatter, and hideous howls, the
Hicks-quelling<br>
Expedition roared down the third corridor of Bannister, and
surged into the<br>
room of that tantalizing T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.!</p>

<p>"Safety first!" shrieked that cheery collegian, stowing his
banjo in the<br>
closet and making a strenuous but futile effort to dive
head-first beneath<br>
the bed, being forcibly restrained by Beef, who clung to his left
ankle.<br>
"Say, to what am I indebted for the honor of this call? Why, when
I got<br>
back to Bannister, you fellows gushed, 'Oh, we're <i>so</i> glad
you're back,<br>
Hicks, old top; we missed even your saengerfests,' and when I
start one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hicks," pronounced Butch Brewster grimly, holding the genial
offender<br>
by the scruff of the neck, "you tantalizing, aggravating,
irritating,<br>
lunatical, conscienceless degenerate! You assassin of Father
Time, you<br>
disturber of the peace, <i>heed</i>! Scoop Sawyer is writing to
Jack Merritt, to<br>
tell about the football team, and Bannister's chances of the
Championship;<br>
he wants to tell Jack all about this Thor! Now, you have acted
like<br>
Herman-Kellar-Thurston long enough, and hear our final word. Read
Scoop's<br>
letter, and if when you finish its perusal you fail to give us
full<br>
information, and answer all questions about Thor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The football team will toss you in a blanket until you do!"
finished Monty<br>
Merriweather, "We intended to wait until after the scrimmage, but
Butch<br>
evidently believes we should end your bothersome mystery as once,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Curiosity killed the cat!'" grinned T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.;
then seeing<br>
the avenues and boulevards of escape were closed, but fighting
for time,<br>
"let me peruse said missive indited by our literarily
overbalanced Scoop. I<br>
am reluctant to dispel the clouds of mystery, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Scoop Sawyer thrust the typewritten pages of the
letter&mdash;composed on<br>
the battered old typewriter in the editorial sanctum of the
Bannister<br>
Weekly&mdash;into Hicks' grasp and with a grin, that blithesome
youth read:</p>

<p>Bannister College, Sept, 27.</p>

<p>DEAR OLD JACK:</p>

<p>There is so <i>much</i> to tell you, old pal, that I scarcely
know where to<br>
start, but you want to know about the football eleven, so I'll
write about<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., and his 'Billion-Dollar Mystery,' as he
calls it;<br>
about Thor, the Prodigious Prodigy. You well know what a
scatter-brained<br>
wretch Hicks is, and how he dearly loves to plot dramatic
climaxes&mdash;to<br>
mystify old Bannister. Just now Hicks has the campus as wrathful
as it is<br>
possible to be with that lovable youth; he has originated a great
mystery,<br>
and achieved a seemingly impossible feat, and instead of
explaining it, he<br>
swaggers around like a Hindoo mystic enshrouded in mystery and
the fellows<br>
are wild enough to tar and feather the incorrigible villain!</p>

<p>To get off to a sprint-start, up in Camp Bannister, before
college opened,<br>
when the squad was in training camp, Butch Brewster says that
Coach<br>
Corridan one day, before Hicks, expressed a fervid ambition to
find a huge,<br>
irresistible fullback&mdash;</p>

<p>Here the chronicle must hang fire, while T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr., grinning<br>
at the wrath his mysterious behavior aroused, peruses those
sections of<br>
Scoop Sawyer's epistle telling of two scenes already described;
first,<br>
the one in the Camp Bannister grub-shack, where Head Coach
Corridan<br>
blue-printed the Gargantuan athlete he desired, and the
blithesome Hicks<br>
confidently requested that the Herculean task be left to him;
second, the<br>
scene of intense excitement on the campus the night that the
missing Hicks<br>
returned personally conducting that mountain of muscle, the
blond-haired<br>
Thor.</p>

<p>Having grinned at these descriptions, the pestiferous Hicks
scanned a<br>
picturesque description by Scoop of the events that transpired
between that<br>
memorable night and the present invasion of the sunny Senior's
room by the<br>
indignant squad.</p>

<p>&mdash;Naturally, Jack, old Bannister was intensely curious to
know who this<br>
"Thor" could be, and how Hicks unearthed such a giant. But,
instead of<br>
swaggering a trifle, as he inevitably does, and saying, 'Oh, I
told you<br>
just to leave it to Hicks!' then telling all about it, after
accomplishing<br>
what everyone believed a ridiculously impossible quest, he
maintains that<br>
provokingly mysterious silence, and John Thorwald (we know his
name,<br>
anyway) stolidly refers us to Hicks. So where Thor originated or
how under<br>
the sun Hicks got on his trail, after making his rash vow to
corral a<br>
mighty fullback, is a deep, dark mystery.</p>

<p>Now for Thor himself. Words cannot describe that Prodigious
Prodigy; he<br>
must be seen to be believed! We do know that he is John Thorwald,
and of<br>
distinctly Norwegian descent, so that calling him after the
mythic Norse<br>
god is extremely appropriate. And he is reminiscent of the great
Thor, with<br>
his vast strength and prowess. Thanks to T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr.'s, love of<br>
mystery, and of tantalizing old Bannister, we know nothing of
Thorwald's<br>
past, but we are sure he has lived and toiled among <i>men</i>,
to possess<br>
that powerful build. I can't describe him, old man, without
resorting to<br>
exaggeration, for ordinary words and phrases are utterly
inadequate with<br>
Thor! Conjure up a vision of Gulliver among the Lilliputians and
you can<br>
picture him towering over us. He is a Viking of old, with his
fair features<br>
and blond hair. Probably twenty-five years old, he has a powerful
frame and<br>
prodigious strength, he dwarfs such behemoths as Butch and Beef,
and makes<br>
such insignificant mortals as little Theophilus and myself seem
like<br>
insects!</p>

<p>Thor is so <i>big</i>, Jack, that when he gets in a room, he
crowds everyone<br>
into the corridor, and fills it alone. No wonder Hicks
telegraphed to knock<br>
out the partitions between five rooms to make space for Thor!
When he<br>
stands on the campus he blots out several sections of scenery,
and the<br>
college disappears, giving the impression he has swallowed it.
Thor is a<br>
slow-minded being, but possessed of a grim determination. To get
an idea<br>
into his mind requires a blackboard and Chautauqua lecturer, but
once he<br>
masters it, he never lets go; so it will be with football
signals, once let<br>
him grasp a play, he will never be confused. He is simply a huge,
stolid<br>
giant. He has a bulldog purpose to get an education, and nothing
else<br>
matters. As for college spirit, the glad comradeship of the
campus, he has<br>
no time for it; he pays no attention to the fellows at all, only
to Hicks.</p>

<p>His devotion to that wretch is pathetic! He follows Hicks
around like a<br>
huge mastiff after a terrier, or an ocean leviathan towed by a
tug-boat; he<br>
seems absolutely helpless without T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., and so
we have<br>
a daily Hicks' personally conducted tour of Thor to interest us.
Briefly,<br>
Jack, John Thorwald is a slow-moving, slow-minded, grimly bulldog
giant,<br>
who has come to Bannister to study, and as for any other phase of
campus<br>
existence, he has never awakened to it!</p>

<p>Now for the football story: Well, the day after Hicks'
sensational arrival,<br>
which I described, Coach Corridan, Captain Butch Brewster, Beef,
Buster,<br>
Pudge, Monty, and Roddy with yours truly, went to Thor's room in
Creighton<br>
just before football practice. We found that Colossus, who had
matriculated<br>
as a Freshman, aided by Hicks, patiently masticating mental food
as served<br>
by Ovid. Coach Corridan said, 'Come on, Thorwald, over to the
Gym.; we'll<br>
fix you out with togs, if we can get two suits big enough to make
one for<br>
your bulk! Ever play the game?' 'I play some,' rumbled Thor
stolidly, never<br>
raising his eyes from his Latin. 'Don't bother me, I want to
<i>study.</i><br>
I have not time for such foolishness. I am here to study, to get
an<br>
education!' 'But,' urged the coach earnestly, 'you <i>must</i>
play football for<br>
your Alma Mater, for old Bannister. Why, you&mdash;you
<i>must</i>, that's all!' Thor<br>
gazed at Hicks questioningly&mdash;I forgot to add that insect's
name&mdash;and<br>
asked, 'Is it so, Hicks? I <i>got</i> to play for the college?'
And when Hicks<br>
grinned, 'Sure, Thor, it must be did. Bannister expects you to
smear the<br>
other teams over the landscape,' that blond Norwegian Viking
said, 'Well,<br>
then, I play.'</p>

<p>All Bannister turned out to behold the "Prodigious Prodigy" on
the football<br>
field. Somewhere&mdash;Hicks won't divulge where&mdash;Thor has
learned the rudiments<br>
of the game. With that bulldog tenacity of his, he has learned
them well.<br>
Hence he was ready for the scrubs, and in the practice game it
was a<br>
veritable slaughter of the innocents. The 'Varsity could not stop
Thor.<br>
Remember 'Ole' Skjarsen, the big Swede of George Fitch's 'Siwash
College'<br>
tales? Thor, after the ten minutes required to teach him a play,
would take<br>
the ball and just wade through the regulars for big gains. The
only way to<br>
stop him was for the entire eleven to cling affectionately to his
bulk,<br>
and then he transported them several yards. He is a phenom, a
veritable<br>
Prodigious Prodigy, and maybe old Bannister isn't <i>wild</i>
with enthusiasm.<br>
His development will be slow but sure, and by the time the big
games for<br>
the championship come, he will be a whole team in himself. Right
now he<br>
goes through daily scrimmage as solemnly as if performing a
sacred rite. He<br>
doesn't thrill with college spirit, but as for
football&mdash;</p>

<p>Leaving Hicks to read the rest of Scoop Sawyer's long missive,
terminating<br>
with indignant condemnation of the sunny youth's love of mystery,
the<br>
terrific enthusiasm roused at old Bannister by the daily
appearance on<br>
Bannister Field of Thor, and his irresistible marches through the
'Varsity,<br>
must be chronicled and explained.</p>

<p>Not for five seasons, not since the year before Hicks, Pudge,
Butch, Beef<br>
and the others of 1919 were Freshmen, had the Gold and Green
corraled that<br>
greatest glory, The State Intercollegiate Football Championship!
In Captain<br>
Butch's Sophomore year, he had flung his bulk into the fray,
training,<br>
sacrificing, fighting like a Trojan, only to see the pennant lost
by a<br>
scant three inches, as Jack Merritt's forty-yard drop-kick for
the goal<br>
that would have won the Championship struck the cross-bar and
bounded back<br>
into the field. And the past season-old Bannister could still
vision that<br>
tragic scene of the biggest game.</p>

<p>The students could picture Captain Brewster, with the
Bannister eleven a<br>
few yards from Ballard's goal-line, and the touchdown that would
give the<br>
Gold and Green that supreme glory. One minute to play; Deacon
Radford had<br>
given Butch the pigskin, and like a berserker, he fought entirely
through<br>
the scrimmage. But a kick on the head had blinded him, in the
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>&mdash;free<br>
of tacklers, with the goal-line, victory, and the Championship so
near, he<br>
staggered, reeled blindly, crashed into an upright, and toppled
backward,<br>
senseless on the field, while the Referee's whistle announced the
end of<br>
the game, and glory to Ballard. Even then, after the first
terrible shock<br>
of the loss, of the cruel blow fate dealt the Gold and Green
two<br>
successive seasons, the slogan was: "Next year&mdash;Bannister
will win the<br>
Championship&mdash;<i>next year</i>!"</p>

<p>It was now "next year!" Losing only Jack Merritt, Babe McCabe
and Heavy<br>
Hughes from the line-up, and having Monty Merrlweather and Bunch
Bingham,<br>
fully as good, Coach Corridan's Gold and Green eleven, before the
season<br>
started, seemed a better fighting machine than even the one of
the year<br>
before. But when the irrepressible T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., in
some<br>
mysterious fashion making good his rash vow to produce a smashing
full-back<br>
that can't be stopped, towed that stolid, blond Colossus, Thor,
to old<br>
Bannister, enthusiasm broke all limits!</p>

<p>Mass-meetings were held every night. Speeches by Coaches,
Captain, players,<br>
Faculty, and students, aroused the campus to the highest pitch;
every day,<br>
the entire student-body, with The Bannister Band, turned out on
Bannister<br>
Field to cheer the eleven, and to watch the Prodigious Prodigy
perform<br>
valorous deeds, like the god Thor. "Bannister College&mdash;State
Championship!"<br>
was the cry, and with the giant Thor to present an irresistible
catapulting<br>
that could not be stopped, the Gold and Green exultantly awaited
the big<br>
games with Hamilton and Ballard.</p>

<p>And yet, the stolid, unemotional, unawakened Thor, on whom
every hope of<br>
the Championship was based, whom all Bannister came out to watch
every day,<br>
practiced as he studied, doggedly, silently. It was evident to
all that<br>
he hated the grind, that he wanted to quit, that his heart was
not in the<br>
game, but for some cause, he drove his Herculean body ahead, and
could not<br>
be stopped!</p>

<p>"Now, you abandoned wretch," said Butch Brewster grimly, as
the<br>
happy-go-lucky Hicks finished Scoop's letter, and glanced about
him wildly<br>
seeking a way of escape, "in one minute you will tell us all
about John<br>
Thorwald, alias 'Thor,' or be tossed sky-high in a blanket by the
football<br>
squad, and please believe me, you'll break all altitude
records!"</p>

<p>"Spare me, you banditti!" pleaded Hicks, reluctant to cease
torturing<br>
Bannister with his Billion-Dollar Mystery, yet equally unwilling
to aviate<br>
from a blanket heaved by the husky athletes. "Why seek ye to
question the<br>
ways of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.? You have your Prodigious
Prodigy&mdash;your<br>
smashing full-back is distributing the 'Varsity over the scenery
with<br>
charming nonchalance that promises dire catastrophe for other
teams, once<br>
he makes the regulars, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that dramatic moment, just as Butch Brewster glanced at
Hicks'<br>
alarm-clock, to start the minute of grace, a startling
interruption saved<br>
the gladsome youth from having to make a decision. A heavy,
creaking tread<br>
shook the corridor, and the squad beheld, looming up in the
doorway, Thor.<br>
He was not in football togs, and as he started to speak his fair
face as<br>
stolid and expressionless as that of a sphinx, Captain Butch
Brewster<br>
stepped toward him.</p>

<p>"Thor!" he exclaimed, seizing the blond Colossus by the arm,
"You aren't<br>
ready for the scrimmage; hustle over to the Gym. and get on your
suit."</p>

<p>But John Thorwald, as passive of feature as though he
announced something<br>
of the most infinitesimal importance, and were not hurling a
bomb-shell<br>
whose explosion, was to shake old Bannister terrifically, spoke
in a<br>
matter-of-fact manner: "I shall not play football&mdash;any
more,"</p>

<p>"What!" Every collegian in Hicks' room, including that dazed
producer<br>
of the Prodigious Prodigy, chorused the exclamation; to them it
was as<br>
stunning a shock as the nation would suffer if its President
calmly<br>
announced, "I'm tired of being President of the United States. I
shall not<br>
report for work tomorrow." Bannister College, ever since the
night that<br>
Thor arrived on the campus, had talked or thought of nothing but
how this<br>
huge, blond-haired Hercules would bring the Championship to the
Gold and<br>
Green; his prodigies on the gridiron, his ever-increasing
prowess, had<br>
aroused enthusiasm to fever heat, and now&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was told wrong," said Thor, shifting his vast tonnage
awkwardly from one<br>
foot to the other, and evidently bewildered at the consternation
caused by<br>
what he believed a trifling announcement, "I understood that I
<i>had</i> to<br>
play football, that the Faculty required it of me, and the
students let me<br>
think so. I have just learned from Doctor Alford that such is not
true,<br>
that I do not have to play unless I choose, hence, I quit. I came
to<br>
college to study, to gain an education. I have toiled long and
hard for<br>
the opportunity, and now I have it, I shall not waste my time on
such<br>
foolishness."</p>

<p>Then, utterly unconscious that he had spoken sentences which
would create<br>
a mighty sensation at old Bannister, that might doom the Gold and
Green<br>
to defeat, lose his Alma Mater the Championship, and bring on
himself the<br>
cruel ostracism and bitter censure of his fellows, John Thorwald
lumbered<br>
down the corridor. A moment of tense silence followed and then
Captain<br>
Butch Brewster groaned.</p>

<p>"It's all over, it's all over, fellows!" he said brokenly,
"Bannister loses<br>
the Championship! We know it is impossible to move Thor on the
football<br>
field, and now that he has said 'No!' to playing football,
dynamite can not<br>
move him from his decision."</p>

<p>Then, crushed and disconsolate, the football squad filed
silently from the<br>
room, to break the glad news to Coach Corridan, and to spread the
joyous<br>
tidings to old Bannister. When they had gone, T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr.,<br>
staring at the figurative black cloud that lowered over his Alma
Mater,<br>
strove to find its silver lining, and at last he partially
succeeded.</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Hicks, with a lugubrious effort to grin,
"Thor's<br>
announcement shocked the squad so much that I was not forced to
explain my<br>
Billion-Dollar Mystery!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER V</p>

<p>HICKS MAKES A DECISION</p>

<p>"In the famous words of Mr. Somebody-Or-Other," quoth T.
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., "something has <i>got</i> to be did, and immediately to
once!"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster nodded assent. So did Head Coach Patrick
Henry Corridan,<br>
Beef McNaughton, Team Manager Socks Fitzpatrick, Monty
Merriweather, Dad<br>
Pendleton, President of the Athletic Association, and Deacon
Radford,<br>
quarter-back, also Shad Fishpaw, who, being Freshman
Class-Chairman,<br>
maintained a discreet silence. Instead of the usual sky-larking,
care-free<br>
crowd that infested the cozy quarters of the happy-go-lucky
Hicks, every<br>
collegian present, except the ever-cheerful youth, seemed to have
lost his<br>
best friend and his last dollar at one fell swoop!</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, something has got to be did!" fleered Beef
McNaughton, the<br>
davenport creaking under the combined tonnage of himself and
Butch<br>
Brewster, "But who will do it? Where's all that
Oh-just-leave-it-to-Hicks<br>
stuff you have pulled for the past three years, you pestiferous
insect?<br>
Bah! You did a lot; you dragged a Prodigious Prodigy to old
Bannister,<br>
enshrouded him in darkest mystery, and now, when he pushed the
'Varsity off<br>
the field and promised to corral the Championship, single-handed,
he puts<br>
his foot down, and says, 'No&mdash;I will not play football!' Get
busy, Little<br>
Mr. Fix-It."</p>

<p>"Oh, just leave it to Hicks!" accommodated that blithesome
Senior, with a<br>
cheeriness he was far from feeling. "You all do know why Thor
won't<br>
play football; it is not like last season, when Deke Radford, a
star<br>
quarter-back, refused either to play, or to explain his refusal.
Let me<br>
get an inspiration, and then Thor will once again gently but
firmly thrust<br>
entire football elevens down the field before him!"</p>

<p>As evidence of how intensely serious was the situation, let it
be<br>
chronicled that, for the first time in his scatter-brained campus
career,<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., did not dare strum his banjo and roar out
ballads<br>
to torture his long-suffering colleagues. Popular and beloved as
he was,<br>
the gladsome youth hesitated to shatter the quietude of the
campus with<br>
his saengerfest, knowing as he did what a terrible blow Thor's
utterly<br>
astounding announcement had been to the college.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock, one night two weeks after the day when
John Thorwald,<br>
better known as Thor, the Prodigious Prodigy, so mysteriously
produced by<br>
Hicks, had stolidly paralyzed old Bannister by unemotionally
stating his<br>
decision to play no more football. Since then, to quote the
Phillyloo Bird,<br>
"Bannister has staggered around the ring like a prizefighter with
the<br>
Referee counting off ten seconds and trying to fight again before
he takes<br>
the count." In truth, the students had made a fatal mistake in
building<br>
all their hopes of victory on that blond giant, Thor; seeing his
wonderful<br>
prowess, and beholding how, in the first week of the season, the
Norwegian<br>
Colossus had ripped to shreds the Varsity line which even the
heavy Ballard<br>
eleven of the year before could not batter, it was but natural
that the<br>
enthusiastic youths should think of the Championship chances in
terms of<br>
Thor. For one week, enthusiasm and excitement soared higher and
higher,<br>
and then, to use a phrase of fiction, everything fell with a
dull,<br>
sickening thud!</p>

<p>In vain did Coach Corridan, the staff of Assistant Coaches,
Captain Butch<br>
Brewster, and others strive to resuscitate football spirit;
nightly<br>
mass-meetings were held, and enough perfervid oratory hurled to
move a<br>
Russian fortress, but to no avail. It was useless to argue that,
without<br>
Thor, Bannister had an eleven better than that of last year,
which so<br>
nearly missed the Championship. The campus had seen the massive
Thor's<br>
prodigies; they knew he could not be stopped, and to attempt to
arouse the<br>
college to concert pitch over the eleven, with that mountain of
muscle<br>
blotting out vast sections of scenery, but not in football togs,
was not<br>
possible.</p>

<p>"One thing is sure," spoke Dad Pendleton seriously, gazing
gloomily from<br>
the window, "unless we get Thor in the line-up for the Big Games,
our last<br>
hope of the Championship is dead and interred! And I feel sorry
for the big<br>
fellow, for already the boys like him just about as much as a
German<br>
loves an Englishman; yet, arguments, threats, pleadings, and
logic have<br>
absolutely no effect on him. He has said 'No,' and that ends
it!"</p>

<p>"He doesn't understand things, fellows," defended T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
with surprising earnestness. "Remember how bewildered he seemed
at our<br>
appeal to his college spirit, and his love for his Alma Mater. We
might as<br>
well have talked Choctaw to him!"</p>

<p>Butch Brewster, Socks Fitzpatrick, Dad Pendleton, Beef
McNaughton, Deacon<br>
Radford, Monty Merriweather, and Shad Fishpaw well remembered
that night<br>
after Thor's tragic decision, when they&mdash;part of a Committee
formed of the<br>
best athletes from all teams, and the most representative
collegians of old<br>
Bannister, had invaded Thor's room in Creighton Hall, to wrestle
with the<br>
recalcitrant Hercules. Even as Hicks spoke, they visioned it
again.</p>

<p>A cold, cheerless room, bare of carpet or pictures, with just
the<br>
study-table, bed, and two chairs. At the study-table, his huge
bulk<br>
sprawling on, and overflowing, a frail chair, they had found the
massive<br>
John Thorwald laboriously reading aloud the Latin he had
translated,<br>
literally by the sweat of his brow. The blond Colossus, impatient
at the<br>
interruption, had shaken his powerful frame angrily, and with no
regard for<br>
campus tradition, had addressed the upperclassmen in a growl:
"Well, what<br>
do you want? Hurry up, I've got to study."</p>

<p>And then, to state it briefly, they had worked with (and on)
the stolid<br>
Thorwald for two hours. They explained how his decision to play
no more<br>
football would practically kill old Bannister's hopes of the
Championship,<br>
would assassinate football spirit on the campus, and cause the
youths to<br>
condemn Thor, and to ostracise him. Waxing eloquent, Butch
Brewster had<br>
delivered a wonderful speech, pleading with John Thorwald to play
the<br>
game. He tried to show that obviously uninterested mammoth that,
like the<br>
Hercules he so resembled, he stood at the parting of the
ways.</p>

<p>"You are on the threshold of your college career, old man!" he
thundered<br>
impressively, though he might as well have tried to shoot holes
in a<br>
battleship with a pop-gun, "What you do now will make or break
you. Do you<br>
want the fellows as friends or as enemies; do you want
comradeship, or<br>
loneliness and ostracism? You have it in your power to do two
<i>big</i> things,<br>
to win the Championship for your Alma Mater, and to win to
yourself the<br>
entire student-body, as friends; will you do that, and build a
firm<br>
foundation for your college years, or betray your Alma Mater, and
gain the<br>
enmity of old Bannister!"</p>

<p>Followed more fervid periods, with such phrases as, "For your
Alma Mater,"<br>
"Because of your college spirit," "For dear old Bannister," and
"For<br>
the Gold and Green!" predominating; all of which terms, to the
stolid,<br>
unimaginative Thorwald being fully as intelligible as Hindustani.
They<br>
appealed to him not to betray his Alma Mater; they implored him,
for his<br>
love of old Bannister; they besought him, because of his college
spirit;<br>
and all the time, for all that the Prodigious Prodigy understood,
they<br>
might as well have remained silent.</p>

<p>"I will tell you something," spoke Thor, at last, with an air
of impatient<br>
resignation, "and don't bother me again, please! I have come to
Bannister<br>
College to get an education, and I have the right to do so,
without being<br>
pestered. I pay my bills, and I am entitled to all the knowledge
I can<br>
purchase. I look from my window, and I see boys, whose fathers
are toiling,<br>
sacrificing, to send them here. Instead of studying, to show
their<br>
gratitude, they loaf around the campus, or in their rooms,
twanging banjos<br>
and guitars, singing silly songs, and sky-larking. I don't know
what all<br>
this rot is you are talking of; 'college spirit,' 'my Alma
Mater,' and so<br>
on. I do not want to play football; I do not like the game; I
need the time<br>
for my study, so I will not play. Both my father and myself have
labored<br>
and sacrificed to send me to college. The past five years, with
one great<br>
ambition to go to college and learn, I have toiled like a
galley-slave.</p>

<p>"And now, when opportunity is mine, do you ask me to
<i>play</i>? You want me to<br>
loaf around, wasting precious time better spent in my studies.
What do I<br>
care whether the boys like me, or hate me? Bah! I can take any
two of you,<br>
and knock your heads together! Their friendship or enmity won't
move me. I<br>
shall study, learn. I will not waste time in senseless
foolishness, and I<br>
<i>won't</i> play football again."</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr. was silent as he stood by the window of
his room,<br>
gazing down at the campus where the collegians were gathering
before<br>
marching to the Auditorium for the nightly mass-meeting that
would vainly<br>
strive to arouse a fighting spirit in the football "rooters."
That<br>
blithesome, heedless, happy-go-lucky youth was capable of far
more serious<br>
thought than old Bannister knew; and more, he possessed the rare
ability<br>
to read character; in the case of Thor, he saw vastly deeper than
his<br>
indignant comrades, who beheld only the surface of the affair.
They knew<br>
only that John Thorwald, a veritable Colossus, had exhibited
football<br>
prowess that practically promised the State Championship to old
Bannister,<br>
and then&mdash;he had quit the game. They understood only that
Thor refused to<br>
play simply because he did not want to, and as to why their
appeals to his<br>
college spirit and his love for his Alma Mater were unheeded they
were<br>
puzzled.</p>

<p>But the gladsome Hicks, always serious beneath his cheerful
exterior, when<br>
old Bannister's interests were at stake, or when a collegian's
career<br>
might be blighted, when the tragedy could be averted, fully
understood. Of<br>
course, as originator of the Billion-Dollar Mystery, and producer
of the<br>
Prodigious Prodigy, he knew more about the strange John Thorwald
than did<br>
his mystified comrades. He knew that Thor, as he named him, was
just a vast<br>
hulk of humanity, stolid, unimaginative of mind, slow-thinking, a
dull,<br>
unresponsive mass, as yet unstirred by that strange, subtle,
mighty thing<br>
called college spirit. He realized that Thor had never had a
chance to<br>
understand the real meaning of campus life, to grasp the glad
fellowship of<br>
the students, to thrill with a great love for his Alma Mater. All
that must<br>
come in time. The blond giant had toiled all his life, had
labored among<br>
men where everything was practical and grim. Small wonder, then,
that he<br>
failed utterly to see why the youths "loafed on the campus, or in
their<br>
rooms, twanging banjos and guitars, singing silly songs, and
skylarking."</p>

<p>"I must save him," murmured Hicks softly, for the others in
his room were<br>
talking of Thor. "Oh, imagine that powerful body, imbued with a
vast love<br>
for old Bannister, think of Thor, thrilling with college spirit.
Why,<br>
Yale's and Harvard's elevens combined could not stop his rushes,
then. I<br>
must save him from himself, from the condemnation of the fellows,
who just<br>
don't understand. I must, some way, awaken him to a complete
understanding<br>
of college life in its entirety, but how? He is so different from
Roddy<br>
Perkins, or Deke Radford."</p>

<p>It seemed that the lovable Hicks was destined to save, every
year of his<br>
campus career, some entering collegian who incurred the wrath,
deserved or<br>
otherwise, of the students. In his Freshman first term, T.
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., indignant at the way little Theophilus Opperdyke, the
timorous,<br>
nervous "grind," had been alarmed at the idea of being hazed, had
by a<br>
sensational escape from a room locked, guarded, and filled with
Sophomores,<br>
gained immunity for himself and the boner for all time, thus
winning the<br>
loyal, pathetic devotion of the Human Encyclopedia. As a
Sophomore, by<br>
crushing James Roderick Perkins' Napoleonic ambition to upset
tradition,<br>
and make Freshmen equal with upperclassmen, Hicks had turned
that<br>
aggressive youth's tremendous energy in the right channels, and
made him a<br>
power for good on the campus.</p>

<p>And, a Junior, he had saved good Deacon Radford. When that
serious youth, a<br>
famous prep. quarter, entered old Bannister, the students were
wild at the<br>
thought of having him to run the Gold and Green team, but to
their dismay,<br>
he refused either to report for practice or to explain his
decision. Hicks,<br>
promising blithely, as usual, to solve the mystery and get Deke
to play,<br>
discovered that the youth's mother, called "Mother Peg" by the
collegians,<br>
was head-waitress downtown at Jerry's and that she made her son
promise<br>
not to own the relationship, and that while she worked to get him
through<br>
college, Deacon would not play football. The inspired Hicks had
gotten<br>
Mother Peg to start College Inn, and board Freshmen unable to get
rooms<br>
in the dormitories, and Deacon had played wonderful football. For
this<br>
achievement, the original youth failed to get glory, for he
sacrificed it,<br>
and swore all concerned to secrecy.</p>

<p>"But Roddy and Deke were different," reflected Hicks,
pondering seriously.<br>
"Both had been to Prep. School, and they understood college life
and campus<br>
spirit. It was Roddy's tremendous ambition that had to be curbed,
and Deke<br>
was the victim of circumstances. But Thorwald&mdash;it is just a
problem of how<br>
to awaken in him an understanding of college spirit. The fellows
don't<br>
understand him, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sudden thought, one of his inspirations, assailed the
blithesome Hicks.<br>
Why not make the fellows understand Thor? Surely, if he explained
the<br>
"Billion-Dollar Mystery," as he humorously called it, and told
why<br>
Thorwald, as yet, had no conception of college life, in its true
meaning,<br>
they would not feel bitter against him; perhaps, instead, though
regretful<br>
at his decision not to play the game, they would all strive to
awaken the<br>
stolid Colossus, to stir his soul to an understanding of
campus<br>
tradition and existence. But that would mean&mdash;"I surely hate
to lose my<br>
Billion-Dollar Mystery!" grinned T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
remembering<br>
the intense indignation of his comrades at his
Herman-Kellar-Thurston<br>
atmosphere of mystery, "It is more fun than, my 'Sheerluck
Holmes'<br>
detective pose or my saengerfests. Still, for old Bannister, and
for Thor."</p>

<p>It would seem only a trifle for the heedless Hicks to give up
his mystery,<br>
and tell Bannister all about Thor; yet, had the Hercules
reconsidered, and<br>
played football, the torturesome youth would have bewildered his
colleagues<br>
as long as possible, or until they made him divulge the truth. He
dearly<br>
loved to torment his comrades, and this had been such an
opportunity for<br>
him to promise nonchalantly to produce a Herculean full-back,
then, to<br>
return to the campus with the Prodigious Prodigy in tow, and for
him to<br>
perform wonders on Bannister Field, naturally aroused the
interest of the<br>
youths, and he had enjoyed hugely their puzzlement, but
now&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say, fellows," he interrupted an excited conversation of a
would-be<br>
Committee of Ways and Means to make Thor play football, "I have
an<br>
announcement to make."</p>

<p>"Don't pester us, Hicks!" warned Captain Butch Brewster,
grimly. "We love<br>
you like a brother, but we'll crush you if you start any
foolishness,<br>
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., with the study-table between himself
and his<br>
comrades, assumed the attitude of a Chautauqua lecturer, one hand
resting<br>
on the table and the other thrust into the breast of his coat,
and<br>
dramatically announced:</p>

<p>"In the Auditorium&mdash;at the regular mass-meeting
tonight&mdash;T. Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., will give the correct explanation of Thor, the Prodigious
Prodigy, and<br>
will solve the Billion-Dollar Mystery!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER VI</p>

<p>HICKS MAKES A SPEECH</p>

<p>The announcement of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., had practically
the same<br>
effect on Head Coach Corridan and the cheery Senior's comrades as
a German<br>
gas-bomb would have on the inmates of an Allied trench. For
several seconds<br>
they stared at the blithesome youth, in a manner scarcely to be
called<br>
aimless, since their looks were aimed with deadly accuracy at
him, but in<br>
general, with the exception of Hicks, those in the room resembled
vastly<br>
some of the celebrated Madame Tussaud's wax-works in London.</p>

<p>"Oh," breathed Monty Merriweather, with the appearance of
dawning<br>
intelligence, "that's so, Coach, Hicks never has disclosed the
details of<br>
his achievement; we were about to extort a confession from him,
when Thor<br>
broke up the league with his announcement, and since then,
Bannister has<br>
been too worried over Thorwald to trifle with Hicks!"</p>

<p>"That's a good idea!" exclaimed Coach Corridan, who had been
remarkably<br>
silent, for him, pondering the football crisis, "Hicks can make
his<br>
explanation at the regular mass-meeting tonight, in the
Auditorium. I'll<br>
post an announcement of his purpose, and you fellows spread the
news among<br>
the students, stating that Hicks will tell how he rounded up
Thor. Some<br>
have shirked these meetings since Thorwald quit the game, and
this will<br>
bring them out, so maybe we can arouse the fighting spirit
again!"</p>

<p>So well did Butch, Beef, Socks, Monty, Dad, Deacon, and Shad
tell the news,<br>
that when the bell in the Administration Hall tower rang at ten
o'clock it<br>
was ascertained by score-keepers that every youth at Bannister,
Freshmen<br>
included, except that Hercules, Thor, had assembled in the
Auditorium. That<br>
stolid behemoth, who regarded the football mass-meeting as
foolishness, was<br>
reported as boning in his cheerless room, fulfilling the mission
for which<br>
he came to college, namely, to get his money's worth of
knowledge, which he<br>
evidently regarded as some commodity for which Bannister served
merely as a<br>
market.</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, on the stage of the Auditorium, the big
assembly-hall<br>
of the college, along with Coach Corridan, several of the Gold
and Green<br>
eleven, two members of the Faculty, several Assistant Coaches,
and T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., stepped forward and stilled the tumult of
the excited<br>
youths with upraised hand.</p>

<p>"We have with us tonight," he spoke, after the fashion of
introducing<br>
after-dinner speakers, "Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Jr., the
celebrated<br>
Magician and Mystifier, who will present for your approval his
world-famous<br>
Billion-Dollar Mystery, and give the correct solution to Thor,
the problem<br>
no one has been able to solve. I take great pleasure in
introducing to you<br>
this evening, Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Jr."</p>

<p>The collegians, firmly believing it was another of the
pestiferous Hicks'<br>
jokes, and wholly unaware of the deep purpose of the
sunny-souled,<br>
irrepressible youth's speech, went into paroxysms of glee, as
the<br>
shadow-like Hicks stepped forward. For several minutes, the hall
echoed<br>
with jeers, shouts, groans, whistles, and sarcastic comments:</p>

<p>"Hire a hall, Hicks; tell it to Sweeney!"&mdash;"Bryan better
look out. Hicks,<br>
the Chau-talker;"&mdash;"Spill the speech, old man; spread the
oratory!"&mdash;"Oh,<br>
where are my smelling-salts? I know I shall faint!"&mdash;"You'd
better play a<br>
banjo-accompaniment to it, Hicks!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., for once in his campus career,
fervidly wished he<br>
had not been such a happy-go-lucky, care-free collegian, for now,
when he<br>
was serious, his comrades refused to believe him to be in such a
state.<br>
However, quiet was obtained at last, thanks to the fact that the
youths<br>
possessed all the curiosity of the proverbial cat who died
thereby, and the<br>
sunny Senior plunged earnestly into his famous speech, that was
destined,<br>
at old Bannister, to rank with that of Demosthenes "On The
Crown," or any<br>
of W. J, Bryan's masterpieces.</p>

<p>"Fellows," began Hicks, without preface, "I know I've built
myself the<br>
reputation of being a scatterbrained, heedless nonentity, and
it's too late<br>
to change now. But tonight, please believe me to be thoroughly in
earnest.<br>
Bannister faces more than one crisis, more than one tragedy. It
is true<br>
that the football eleven is crippled by the defection of Thor,
that we<br>
fellows have somewhat unreasonably allowed his quitting the game
to shake<br>
our spirit, but there is more at stake than football victories,
than even<br>
the State Intercollegiate Football Championship! The future of a
student,<br>
of a present Freshman, his hopes of becoming a loyal, solid,
representative<br>
college man, a tremendous power for good, at old Bannister, hang
in the<br>
balance at this moment! I speak of John Thorwald. You students
have it in<br>
your power to make or break him, to ruin his college years and
make him a<br>
recluse, a misanthrope, or to gradually bring him to a full
realization of<br>
what college life and campus tradition really mean."</p>

<p>"I have made a great mystery of Thor, just for a lark, but the
enmity and<br>
condemnation of the campus for him because he quit football
suddenly, shows<br>
me that the time for skylarking is past. For his sake, I must
plead. He is<br>
not to blame, altogether, for quitting. Myself, and you fellows,
gave him<br>
the impression that it was a Faculty requirement for him to play
football,<br>
for we feared he would not play, otherwise; when he learned that
it was not<br>
a Faculty rule, he simply quit."</p>

<p>Here T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., seeing that at last he had
convinced the<br>
collegians of his earnestness, though they seemed fairly
paralyzed at the<br>
phenomenon, paused, and produced a bundle of papers before
resuming.</p>

<p>"Now, I'll try to explain the 'mystery' as briefly and as
clearly as<br>
possible. Up at Camp Bannister, before college opened, Coach
Corridan, as<br>
you know, outlined to Butch, Deke, and myself, his dream of a
Herculean,<br>
irresistible full-back; I said, 'Just leave It to Hicks!' and
they believed<br>
that I, as usual, just made that remark to torment them. But such
was not<br>
the case. When I joined them, I remarked that I had a letter from
my Dad;<br>
Deke made some humorous remarks, and I forgot to read it aloud,
as I<br>
intended. Then, after Coach Corridan blue-printed his giant
full-back, I<br>
kept silent as to Dad's letter, for reasons you'll understand.
But, after<br>
all, there was no mystery about my leaving Camp Bannister, after
making a<br>
seemingly rash vow, and returning to college with a 'Prodigious
Prodigy'<br>
who filled specifications, In fact, before I left Camp Bannister,
at the<br>
moment I made my rash promise&mdash;I had Thor already lined
up!"</p>

<p>"I shall now read a dipping or two, and a letter or two from
my Dad. The<br>
clippings came in Dad's letter to me at Camp Bannister, the
letter I<br>
intended to read to Coach Corridan, Deke, and Butch, but which I
decided to<br>
keep silent about, after the Coach told of the full-back he
wanted, for<br>
I knew I had him already! First, a clipping from the San
Francisco<br>
Examiner, of August 25:</p>

<p>MAROONED SAILOR RESCUED&mdash;TEN YEARS<br>
ON SOUTH SEA ISLAND!SOLE SURVIVOR OF<br>
ILL-FATED CRUISE OF THE ZEPHYR</p>

<p>"The trading-schooner Southern Cross, Captain Martin Bascomb,
skipper,<br>
put into San Francisco yesterday with a cargo of copra from the
South Sea<br>
Islands. On board was John Thorwald, Sr., who for the past ten
years<br>
has been marooned on an uninhabited coral isle of the Southern
Pacific,<br>
together with 'Long Tom' Watts, who, however, died several months
ago.<br>
Thorwald's story reads like a thrilling bit of fiction. He was
first mate<br>
of the ill-fated yacht Zephyr, which cleared from San Francisco
ten years<br>
ago with Henry B. Kingsley, the Oil-King, and a pleasure party,
for a<br>
cruise under the southern star. A terrific tornado wrecked the
yacht, and<br>
only Thorwald and 'Long Tom' escaped, being cast upon the coral
island,<br>
where for ten years they existed, unable to attract the attention
of the<br>
few craft that passed, as the isle was out of the regular lanes.
Only when<br>
Captain Martin Bascomb, in the trading-schooner Southern Cross,
touched<br>
at the island, hoping to find natives with whom to trade supplies
for<br>
copra, were they found, and 'Long Tom' had been dead some
months."</p>

<p>"Despite the harrowing experiences of his exile, Thorwald, a
vast hulk of a<br>
stolid, unimaginative Norwegian, who reminds one of the Norse
god, 'Thor,'<br>
intends to ship as first mate on the New York-Christiania
Steamship Line.<br>
It is said that Thorwald has a son, at this time about
twenty-five years of<br>
age, somewhere In this country, whom he will seek,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., at this juncture, terminated the
newspaper story,<br>
and finding that his explanation held his comrades spellbound, he
produced<br>
a letter, and drew out the message, after stating the youths
could read the<br>
entire news-story of John Thorwald, Sr., later.</p>

<p>"This is the letter I received from my Dad," he explained to
the intensely<br>
interested Bannister youths, who were giving a concentrated
attention that<br>
members of the Faculty would have rejoiced to receive from them.
"Up at<br>
Camp Bannister&mdash;I was just about to read it to Coach
Corridan, Butch, and<br>
Deke Radford, when Deke chaffed me, and then the Coach outlined
the mammoth<br>
full-back he desired, so I kept quiet. I'll now read it to
you:</p>

<p>"Pittsburgh, Pa., Sept, 17.</p>

<p>"DEAR SON THOMAS:</p>

<p>"Read the inclosed clipping from the San Francisco Examiner of
August 25,<br>
and then pay close attention to the following facts: At the time
of this<br>
news-story I was in 'Frisco on business, as you will recall, and
for<br>
reasons to be outlined, when I read of the Southern Cross finding
the<br>
marooned John Thorwald, and bringing him to that city, I was
particularly<br>
interested, so much so that I at once looked up the one-time
first mate of<br>
the ill-starred Zephyr and brought him to Pittsburgh in my
private car.<br>
My reason was this; in my employ, in the International Steel
Combine's<br>
mill, was John Thorwald's son, John Thorwald, Jr.</p>

<p>"To state facts as briefly as possible, almost a year ago, as
I took some<br>
friends through the steel rolling mill, I chanced to step
directly beneath<br>
a traveling crane, lowering a steel beam; seeing my peril, I was
about to<br>
step aside when I caught my foot and fell. Just then a veritable
giant,<br>
black and grimy, leaped forward, and with a prodigious display of
strength,<br>
placed his powerful back under the descending weight, staving it
off until<br>
I rolled over to safety!</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I had the fellow report to my office, and
instinctively<br>
feeling that I wanted to show my gratitude, without being
patronizing, he<br>
responded to my question as to what I could do to reward him, by
asking<br>
simply that I get him some job that would allow him to attend
night school.<br>
He stated that, owing to the fact that he worked alternate weeks
at night<br>
shift he was unable to do so. Questioning him further, I learned
the<br>
following facts:</p>

<p>"He was John Thorwald, Jr., only son of John Thorwald, Sr., a
Norwegian;<br>
his mother was also a Norwegian, but he is a natural born
American.<br>
Realizing the opportunities for an educated young man in our
land,<br>
Thorwald's parents determined that he should gain knowledge, and
until he<br>
was fifteen years old, he attended school in San Francisco. When
he was<br>
fifteen, his father signed as first mate on the yacht Zephyr,
going with<br>
the oil-king, Henry B. Kingsley, on a pleasure cruise in the
Southern<br>
Pacific; Thorwald, Sr.'s, story you read in the paper. Soon after
the news<br>
of the Zephyr's wreck, with all on board lost, as was then
supposed,<br>
Thorwald's mother died. Her dying words (so young Thorwald told
me, and I<br>
was moved by his simple, straightforward tale) were an appeal to
her<br>
boy. She made him promise, for her sake, to study, study, study
to gain<br>
knowledge, and to rise in the world! Thorwald promised. Then,
believing<br>
both his parents dead, the young Norwegian, a youth of fifteen
without<br>
money, had to shift for himself.</p>

<p>"Thomas, Jack London could weave his adventures into a
gripping<br>
masterpiece. Starting in as cabin-boy on a freighter to Alaska,
young<br>
Thorwald, in the past ten years, has simply crowded his life
with<br>
adventure, thrill, and experience, though thrills mean nothing to
him. He<br>
was in the Klondike gold-fields, in the salmon canneries, a
prospector, a<br>
lumber-jack in the Canadian Northwest, a cowboy, a sailor, a
worker in the<br>
Panama Canal Zone, on the Big Ditch, and too many other things to
remember.<br>
Finally, he drifted to Pittsburgh, where his prodigious strength
served him<br>
in the steel-mills, and, let me add, served <i>me</i>, as I
stated.</p>

<p>"And ever, no matter where he wandered, or what was his toil,
whenever<br>
possible, Thorwald studied. His promise to his mother was always
his goal,<br>
and in the cities he studied, or in the wilds he read all the
books he<br>
could find. The past year, finding he had a good-pay job in
Pittsburgh, he<br>
settled to determined effort, and by sheer resolution, by his
wonderful<br>
power to grasp facts and ideas for good once he gets them, he
made great<br>
progress in night school, until he was shifted, a week before he
saved my<br>
life, to work that required him to toil nightly, alternate weeks.
So, for a<br>
year, Thor has had every possible advantage, some, unknown to
him, I paid<br>
for myself; I got him clerical work, with shorter hours, he went
to night<br>
school, and I employed the very best tutor obtainable, letting
Thorwald<br>
pay him, as he thought, though his payments wouldn't keep the
tutor in<br>
neckties. The gratitude of the blond giant is pathetic, and
suspecting that<br>
I paid the tutor something, he insisted on paying all he could,
which I<br>
allowed, of course.</p>

<p>"Well, in August, a year after Thorwald rescued me from
serious injury,<br>
perhaps death, I was in 'Frisco, and read of Thorwald, Sr.'s
rescue and<br>
return. Overjoyed, I took the father to Pittsburgh, to the son. I
witnessed<br>
their meeting, with the father practically risen from the dead,
and all<br>
those stolid, unimaginative Norwegians did was to shake hands
gravely!<br>
Young Thorwald told of his mother's last words, and of his
promise, of his<br>
having studied all the years, and of his late progress, so that
he was<br>
ready to enter college. His father, happy, insisted that he enter
this<br>
September, and he would pay for his son's college course, to make
up for<br>
the years the youth struggled for himself&mdash;Kingsley's heirs,
I believe,<br>
gave Thorwald, Sr., five thousand dollars on his return. So,
though<br>
grateful to me for the aid I offered, they would receive no
financial<br>
assistance, for they want to work it out themselves, and help the
youth<br>
make good his promise to his dying mother.</p>

<p>"Much as I love old Bannister, my Alma Mater, I would not have
tried to<br>
send Thorwald there, had I not deemed it a good place for him.
However,<br>
since it is a liberal, not a technical, education he wants, it is
all<br>
right; and that prodigious strength will serve the Gold and Green
on the<br>
football field. Now, Thomas, I want you to meet him in
Philadelphia, and<br>
take him to Bannister, look out for him, get him started O. K.,
and do all<br>
you can for him. Get him to play football, if you can, but don't
condemn<br>
if he refuses. Remember, his life has been grim and
unimaginative; he has<br>
toiled and studied, it is probable he will not understand college
life at<br>
first."</p>

<p>"That's all I need to read of Dad's letter, fellows,"
concluded T. Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr. "After I got it, and Coach Corridan, Butch, and Beef
heard my<br>
seemingly rash vow to round up a giant full-back, I made a
mystery of it; I<br>
loafed in Philadelphia and Atlantic City until I met Thor, and
brought him<br>
here. You have all the data regarding Thor, 'The Billion-Dollar
Mystery.'"</p>

<p>The students, almost as one, drew a deep breath. They had been
enthralled<br>
by the story, and their feeling toward Thor had undergone a vast
change.<br>
Stirred by hearing of his promise to his dying mother, thrilled
at the way<br>
the stolid, determined Norwegian had ceaselessly studied to make
something<br>
of himself for the sake of his mother's sacred memory, the
Bannister youths<br>
now thought of football, of the Championship, as insignificant,
beside the<br>
goal of Thorwald, Jr. The blond Colossus, whom an hour ago all
Bannister<br>
reviled and condemned for not playing the game, who was a campus
outcast,<br>
was now a hero; thanks to the erstwhile heedless Hicks, whose
intense<br>
earnestness in itself was a revelation to the amazed collegians,
Thor stood<br>
before them in a different light, and the impulsive,
whole-souled, generous<br>
youths were now anxious to make amends.</p>

<p>"Thor! Thor! Thor!" was the thunderous cry, and the Bannister
yell for<br>
the Prodigious Prodigy shattered the echoes. Then T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
ecstatically joyous, again stilled the tumult, and spoke in
behalf of John<br>
Thorwald.</p>

<p>"We all understand Thor now, fellows," he said, beaming on his
comrades.<br>
"We want him to play football, and we'll keep after him to play,
but we<br>
won't condemn him if he refuses. At present, Thor is simply a
stolid,<br>
unimaginative, dull mass of muscle. As you can realize, his
nature, his<br>
life so far have not tended to make him appreciate the gayer,
lighter side<br>
of college life, or to grasp the traditions of the campus. To
him, college<br>
is a market; he pays his money and he takes the knowledge handed
out. We<br>
can not blame him for not understanding college existence in its
entirety,<br>
or that the gaining of knowledge is a small part of the
representative<br>
collegian's purpose.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, here's our job, and let's tackle it together: To
awaken in<br>
Thor a great love for old Bannister, to cause college spirit to
stir his<br>
practical soul. Let every fellow be his friend, let no one speak
against<br>
him, because of football. We must work slowly, carefully,
gradually making<br>
him grasp college traditions, and once he awakens to the real
meaning of<br>
campus life, what a power he will be in the college and on the
athletic<br>
field! Maybe he will not play football this season, but let us
help him to<br>
awaken!"</p>

<p>With wild shouts, the aroused collegians poured from the
Auditorium, an<br>
excited, turbulent mass of youthful humanity, a tide that swept
T. Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., on the shoulders of several, out on the campus.
Massed beneath<br>
the window of John Thorwald's room, in Creighton Hall, the
Bannister<br>
students, now fully understanding that stolid Hercules, and
stirred to<br>
admiration of him by T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, great speech,
cheered the<br>
somewhat mystified Thor again and again; in vast sound waves, the
shouts<br>
rolled up to his open window:</p>

<p>"Rah! Rah! Rah-rah-rah! Thor! Thor! Thor!" Captain Brewster,
through a<br>
big megaphone, roared; "Fellows&mdash;What's the matter with
Thor?"</p>

<p>And in a terrific outburst which, as the Phillyloo Bird
afterward said,<br>
"Like to of busted Bannister's works!" the enthusiastic
collegians<br>
responded:</p>

<p>"He's&mdash;all&mdash;right!"</p>

<p>Then Butch, apparently in quest of information, persisted:</p>

<p>"Who's all right?"</p>

<p>To which the three hundred or more youths, all seemingly
equipped with<br>
lungs of leather, kindly answered:</p>

<p>"Thor! Thor! Thor!"</p>

<p>Still, though the Phillyloo Bird declared that this vocal
explosion caused<br>
the seismographs as Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and in
Salt Lake<br>
City, Utah, to register an earthquake somewhere, it had on the
blond<br>
Freshman a strange effect. The vast mountain of muscle lumbered
heavily<br>
across the room, gazed down at the howling crowd of collegians
without<br>
emotion, then slammed down the window, and returned to study.</p>

<p>"Good night" called Hicks. "The show is over! Let him have
another yell,<br>
boys, to show we aren't insulted; then we'll disband!"</p>

<p>Considering Thorwald's cool reception of their overtures,
which some youth<br>
remarked, "Were as noisy as that of a Grand Opera Orchestra," it
was quite<br>
surprising to the students, in the morning, when what occurred an
hour<br>
after their serenade was revealed to them. As the story was told
by those<br>
who witnessed the scene, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., Butch, Beef,
Monty, Pudge,<br>
Roddy, Biff, Hefty, Tug, Buster, and Coach Corridan after the
commotion<br>
subsided, retired to the sunny Hicks' quarters, where the
football<br>
situation was discussed, along with ways and means to awaken
Thor, when<br>
that colossal Freshman himself loomed up in the doorway.</p>

<p>As they afterward learned, several excited Freshmen had dared
to invade<br>
Thor's den, even while he studied, and give him a more or less
correct<br>
account of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s masterly oration in his
defense. Out of<br>
their garbled descriptions, big John Thorwald grasped one salient
point,<br>
and straightway he started for Hicks' room, leaving the indignant
Freshmen<br>
to tell their story to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Hicks," said Thor, not bothering with the "Mr." required of
all Freshmen,<br>
as his vast bulk crowded the doorway, "is it true that Mr. Thomas
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Sr., wants me to play football? He has been very kind to
me, and<br>
has helped me, and so have you, here at college. After a year of
study, I<br>
should have had to stop night-school, but for him&mdash;instead,
I got another<br>
year, and prepared for Bannister. I did not know that <i>he</i>
desired me to<br>
play, but if he does, I feel under obligation to show my great
gratitude,<br>
both for myself and for my father,"</p>

<p>A moment of silence, for the glorious news could not be
grasped in a<br>
second; those in the room, knowing Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr.'s,
brilliant<br>
athletic record at old Bannister, and understanding his great
love for<br>
his Alma Mater, knew that Hicks, Sr., had sent Thor to Bannister
to play<br>
football for the Gold and Green, though, as he had written his
son, he<br>
would not have done so had he honestly believed that another
college would<br>
suit the ambitious Goliath better.</p>

<p>"Does he?" stammered the dazed T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., while
the others<br>
echoed the words feebly, "Yes, I should say he <i>does</i>!"</p>

<p>For a second, the ponderous young Colossus hesitated, and
then, as calmly<br>
as though announcing he would add Greek to his list of studies,
and wholly<br>
unaware that his words were to bring joy to old Bannister, he
spoke<br>
stolidly.</p>

<p>"Then I shall play football."</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER VII</p>

<p>HICKS STARTS ANOTHER MYSTERY.</p>

<p>  "Fifteen men sat on the dead man's chest&mdash;<br>
  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!<br>
  Drink and the Devil had done for the rest&mdash;<br>
  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!"</p>

<p>T HAVILAND HICKS, JR., his chair tilted at a perilous angle,
and his feet<br>
thrust gracefully atop of the study-table, in his cozy room, one
Friday<br>
afternoon two weeks after John Thorwald's return to the football
squad, was<br>
fathoms deep in Stevenson's "Treasure Island." As he perused the
thrilling<br>
pages, the irrepressible youth twanged a banjo accompaniment, and
roared<br>
with gusto the piratical chantey of Long John Silver's buccaneer
crew;<br>
Hicks, however, despite his saengerfest, was completely lost in
the<br>
enthralling narrative, so that he seemed to hear the parrot
shrieking,<br>
"Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!" and the wild refrain:</p>

<p>  "Fifteen men sat on the dead man's chest&mdash;<br>
  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!"</p>

<p>He was reading that breathlessly exciting part where the
cabin-boy of the<br>
Hispaniola, and Israel Hands have their terrible fight to the
death, with<br>
the dodging over the dead man rolling in the scuppers, the
climbing up the<br>
mast, and the dirk pinning the boy's shoulder, before Hands is
shot and<br>
goes to join his mate on the bottom; just at the most absorbing
page, as he<br>
twanged his beloved banjo louder, and roared the chantey, there
sounded,<br>
"Tramp&mdash;tramp&mdash;tramp!" in the corridor, the heavy tread
of many feet<br>
sounded, coming nearer. Instinctively realizing that the
pachydermic parade<br>
was headed for <i>his</i> room, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., rushed to
the closet,<br>
murmuring, "Safety first!" as usual, and stowed away his banjo.
He was just<br>
in the nick of time, for a second later there crowded into his
room Captain<br>
Butch, Pudge, Beef, Hefty, Biff, Monty, Roddy, Bunch, Tug,
Buster, Coach<br>
Corridas, and Thor, the latter duo bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>"Hicks, you unjailed public nuisance!" said Butch Brewster,
affectionately.<br>
"We, whom you behold, are going for to enter into that room
across the<br>
corridor from your boudoir, and hold a football signal quiz and
confab. We<br>
should request that you permit a thunderous silence to originate
in your<br>
cozy retreat, for the period of at least a hour! A word to the
<i>wise</i> is<br>
sufficient, so I have spoken several, that even you may
comprehend my<br>
meaning,"</p>

<p>"I gather you, fluently!" grinned T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
taking up<br>
"Treasure Island" and his graceful pose once more. "Leave me to
peruse the<br>
thrilling pages of this classic blood-and-thunder book, and I'll
cause a<br>
beautiful serenity to obtain hither."</p>

<p>"See that you do, you pestiferous insect!" threatened Beef
McNaughton,<br>
ominously. "Come on, fellows, Hicks can't escape our vengeance,
if<br>
he bursts into what he fatuously believes is song. Just let him
act<br>
hippicanarious, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>When the Gold and Green eleven, half of which, to judge by
size, was<br>
Thor, had gone with Coach Corridan into the room across from that
of the<br>
blithesome Hicks, the sunny-souled Senior tried to resume his
perusal of<br>
"Treasure Island," but somehow the spell had been broken by the
invasion of<br>
his cozy quarters. So, after vainly essaying to take up the
thread of the<br>
story again, Hicks arose and stood by the window, gazing across
the campus<br>
to Bannister Field, deserted, since the football team rested for
the game<br>
of the morrow. As he stood there, the gladsome Hicks reflected
seriously.<br>
He thought of "Thor," and decided sorrowfully that the problem of
awakening<br>
that stolid Colossus to a full understanding of campus life was
as unsolved<br>
as ever.</p>

<p>"But I <i>won't</i> give it up!" declared Hicks, determinedly.
"I have always<br>
been good at math, and I won't let this problem baffle me."</p>

<p>Since the night, two weeks back, when T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
had made his<br>
memorable speech, explaining to his fellow-students the
"Billon-Dollar<br>
Mystery," and arousing in them a vast admiration for the
slow-minded,<br>
plodding John Thorwald, every collegian had done his best to
befriend the<br>
big Freshman. Upperclassmen helped him with his studies. Despite
his almost<br>
rude refusal to meet any advances, the collegians always had a
cheery<br>
greeting for him, and his class-mates, in fear and trembling,
invaded<br>
his den at times, to show him they were his friends. Yet, despite
these<br>
whole-hearted efforts, only two of old Bannister did the silent
Thor<br>
seem to desire as comrades: the festive Hicks, for reasons
known,<br>
and&mdash;remarkable to chronicle&mdash;little Theophilus
Opperdyke, the timorous,<br>
studious "Human Encyclopedia."</p>

<p>"Colossus and Lilliputian!" the Phillyloo Bird quaintly
observed once when<br>
this strangely assorted duo appeared on the campus. "Say,
fellows&mdash;some<br>
time Thor will accidentally sit on Theophilus, and we'll have
another<br>
mystery, the disappearance of our boner!"</p>

<p>The generous Hicks, longing for Thor's awakening to come, was
not in the<br>
least jealous of his loyal little friend, Theophilus. In fact, he
was<br>
sincerely delighted that the unemotional Hercules desired the
comradeship<br>
of the grind, and he urged the Human Encyclopedia to strive
constantly to<br>
arouse in Thor a realization of college existence, and a true
knowledge of<br>
its meaning. At least one thing, Theophilus reported, had been
achieved by<br>
Hicks' defense of Thorwald, and the subsequent attitude of the
collegians&mdash;<br>
the colossal Freshman was puzzled, quite naturally. When over
three hundred<br>
youths criticized, condemned, and berated him one night, and the
next, even<br>
before he reconsidered his decision about football, came under
his window<br>
and cheered him, no wonder the young Norwegian was
bewildered.</p>

<p>On the football field, with his dogged determination, his
bulldog way of<br>
hanging on to things until he mastered them, big Thor progressed
slowly,<br>
and surely; the past Saturday, against the heavy Alton eleven,
the blond<br>
Freshman had been sent in for the second half, and, to quote an
overjoyed<br>
student, he had "busted things all up!" It seemed simply
impossible to stop<br>
that terrible rush of his huge body. Time after time he plowed
through the<br>
line for yards, and old Bannister, visioning Thor distributing
Hamilton and<br>
Ballard over the field, in the big games, literally hugged
itself.</p>

<p>And yet, despite Thorwald's invincible prowess, despite the
vast joy of<br>
old Bannister at the chances of the Championship, some
intangible<br>
shadow hovered over the campus. It brooded over the
training-table, the<br>
shower-rooms after scrimmage, on Bannister Field during practice;
as yet,<br>
no one had dared to give it form, by voicing his thought, but
though no<br>
youth dared admit it, something was wrong, there was a defective
cog in the<br>
machinery of that marvelous machine, the Gold and Green
eleven.</p>

<p>"'Oh, just leave it to Hicks," quoth that sunny youth, at
length, turning<br>
from the window; "I'll solve the problem, or what is more
probable,<br>
Theophilus may stir that sodden hulk of humanity, after awhile. I
won't<br>
worry about it, for that gets me nothing, and it will all come
out O.K.,<br>
I'm positive!"</p>

<p>At this moment, just as T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., picked up
"Treasure Island"<br>
again, he heard drifting across the corridor from the room
opposite, in<br>
Butch Brewster's familiar voice:</p>

<p>"&mdash;Yes, I'll win three more Bs'&mdash;one each in
football, baseball and track;<br>
next spring, I'll annex my last B at old Bannister,
fellows&mdash;"</p>

<p>His <i>last</i> B&mdash;The words struck the blithesome Hicks
with sledge-hammer<br>
force. Big Butch Brewster was talking of his last B, when he, T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., had never won his first; with a feeling almost of
alarm, the<br>
sunny youth realized that this was his final year at old
Bannister, his<br>
last chance to win his athletic letter, and to make happy his
beloved Dad,<br>
by helping him to realize part of his life's ambition&mdash;to
behold his son<br>
shattering Hicks, Sr.'s, wonderful record. His final chance, and
outside of<br>
his hopes of winning the track award in the high-jump, Hicks saw
no way to<br>
win his B.</p>

<p>Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., as has been chronicled, the
beloved Dad of the<br>
cheery Senior, a Pittsburgh millionaire Steel King, was a
graduate of old<br>
Bannister, Class of '92. While wearing the Gold and Green, he had
made<br>
an all-round athletic record never before, or afterward, rivaled
on<br>
the campus. At football, basketball, track, and baseball, he was
a<br>
scintillating star, annexing enough letters to start an alphabet,
had they<br>
been different ones. Quite naturally, when the Doctor, speaking
anent<br>
the then infantile Thomas Haviland Hicks, Jr., said, "Mr. Hicks,
it's a<br>
boy!"&mdash;the one-time Bannister athlete straightway began to
dream of the day<br>
when his only son and heir should follow in his Dad's footsteps,
shattering<br>
the records made at Bannister, and at Yale, by Hicks,
<i>p&egrave;re</i>.</p>

<p>However, to quote a sporting phrase, the son of the Steel King
"upset the<br>
dope!" At the start of his Senior year, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.
had not<br>
annexed a single athletic honor, nor did the signs point to any
records<br>
being in peril of getting shattered by his prowess; as Hicks
himself<br>
phrased it, "Dame Nature was <i>some stingy</i> when she handed
out the Hercules<br>
stuff to me!" The happy-go-lucky youth, when he matriculated as a
Freshman<br>
at Bannister College, was builded on the general lines of a
toothpick, and<br>
had he elected to follow a pugilistic career, a division somewhat
lighter<br>
than the tissue paperweight class would have had to be devised
to<br>
accommodate the splinter-student. A generous, sunny-souled,
intensely<br>
democratic collegian, despite his father's wealth, the festive
Hicks, with<br>
his room always open-house to all; his firm friendship for star
athlete<br>
or humble boner, his never-failing sunny nature, together with
his famous<br>
Hicks Personally Conducted Expeditions downtown to the Beef-Steak
Busts he<br>
had originated, in his three years at old Bannister, had made
himself the<br>
most popular and beloved youth on the campus, but, he had not won
his B!</p>

<p>And he had tried. With a full realization, of his Dad's
ambition, his<br>
life-dream to behold his son a great athlete, the blithesome
Hicks had<br>
tried, but with hilariously futile results. Nature had endowed
him, as he<br>
told his loyal comrade, Butch Brewster, with "the Herculean build
of a<br>
Jersey mosquito," and his athletic powers neared zero infinity.
In his<br>
Freshman year, he inaugurated his athletic career by running the
wrong way<br>
in the Sophomore-Freshman football game, scoring a touchdown that
won for<br>
the enemy, and naturally, after that performance, every athletic
effort was<br>
greeted with jeers by the students,</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> tried!" said Hicks, producing two letters from
the study-table,<br>
"But not like I should have tried. I could never have played on
the eleven,<br>
or on the nine, but I have a chance in the high-jump. I know I've
been<br>
indolent and care-free, and I ought to have trained harder. Well,
I just<br>
must win my track B this spring, but as to keeping the rash
promise I made<br>
to Butch as a Freshman&mdash;not a chance!"</p>

<p>It had been at the close of his Freshman year, after Hicks, in
the<br>
Interclass Track Meet, had smashed hurdles, broken high-jumping
cross-bars,<br>
finished last in several events, and jeopardized his life with
the shot and<br>
hammer, that he made the rash vow to which he now had reference.
Butch,<br>
believing his sunny friend had entered all the events just to
entertain the<br>
crowd, in his fun-loving way, was teasing him about his
ridiculous fiascos,<br>
when Hicks had told him the story&mdash;how his Dad wanted him to
try and be a<br>
famous athlete; he showed Butch a letter, received before the
meet, asking<br>
his son to try every event, and to keep on training, so as to win
his B<br>
before he graduated. Butch, great-hearted, was surprised and
moved by the<br>
revelation that the gladsome youth, even as he was jeered by his
friendly<br>
comrades, who thought he performed for sport, was striving to
have his<br>
Dad's dream come true; he had sympathized with his classmate, and
then his<br>
scatter-brained colleague had aroused his indignation by vowing,
with a<br>
swaggering confidence:</p>

<p>"'Oh, just leave it to Hicks!' Remember this, Butch, before I
graduate from<br>
old Bannister, I shall have won my B in three branches of
sport!"</p>

<p>Butch had snorted incredulously. To win the football or the
baseball B,<br>
the gold letter for the former, and the green one for the latter
sport,<br>
an athlete had to play in three-fourths of the season's games, on
the<br>
"'Varsity"; to gain the white track letter, one had to win a
first place in<br>
some event, in a regularly scheduled track meet with another
team. And now,<br>
Butch's skepticism seemed confirmed, for at the start of his last
year at<br>
college, Hicks had not annexed a single B, though he bade fair to
corral<br>
one in the spring in the high-jump.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho!" chuckled Hicks, at length. "Here I am threatening
to get gloomy<br>
again! Well I'll sure train hard to win my track letter, and that
seems<br>
all I can do! I'd like to win my three B's, and jeer at Butch,
next June,<br>
but&mdash;<i>it can't be did</i>! I shall now twang my trusty
banjo, and drive dull<br>
care away."</p>

<p>Quite forgetful of the football conclave across the corridor,
and of Butch<br>
Brewster's request for quiet, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr. dragged out
his<br>
beloved banjo, caressed its strings lovingly, and roared:</p>

<p>  "Fifteen men sat on the dead man's chest&mdash;<br>
  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!<br>
  Drink and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hicks!" Big Butch Brewster crashed across the corridor, both
doors being<br>
open. "Is this how you maintain a quiet? I'm going to call Thor
over and<br>
make him sit down on you! Why, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have mercy!" plead the grinning Hicks. "Honest, Butch, I
didn't go to bust<br>
up the league&mdash;I&mdash;I heard you talk about your B's, and
I got to thinking<br>
that I have but little time to make my Dad happy; see, here's
proof&mdash;read<br>
these letters I was perusing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Puzzled, Butch scanned the first one, dated back in the May of
their<br>
Freshman year; Hicks had received it before the class track meet,
and, as<br>
chronicled, he had heard from his sunny comrade later, how it
impelled the<br>
splinter youth to try every event, while Bannister believed him
to enter<br>
them for fun. The letter was post-marked "Pittsburgh, Pa.," and
it read:</p>

<p>DEAR SON THOMAS:</p>

<p>Your last term's report gratified me immensely, and I am proud
of your<br>
class record, and scholastic achievements. Pitch in, and lead
your class,<br>
and make your Dad happy.</p>

<p>But there is something else of which I want to write, Thomas.
As you must<br>
know, it has always been a cause of keen regret to me that you
have never<br>
seemed to care for athletics of any sort; you appear to be too
indolent and<br>
ease-loving to sacrifice, or to endure the hardships of training.
I suppose<br>
it is because of my athletic record both at Bannister and at old
Yale that<br>
I am so eager to see you become a star; in fact, it is my life's
most<br>
cherished ambition to have you become as famous as your Dad.</p>

<p>However, I realize that my fond dream can never come true.
Nature has not<br>
made you naturally strong and athletic, and what athletic success
you may<br>
gain, must come from long and hard training and practice. If you
can only<br>
win your college letter, your B, Thomas, while at Bannister, I
shall be<br>
fully content.</p>

<p>I said nothing when you failed even to try for the teams at
your<br>
Preparatory School, but I did hope that at Bannister, under good
coaches<br>
and trainers, you would at least endeavor to win your letter. I
must admit<br>
that I am disappointed, for you have not even made an earnest
effort to<br>
find your event. Often, by trying everything, especially in a
track meet, a<br>
fellow finds his event, and later stars in it.</p>

<p>I really believe that if you would start in now to develop
yourself by<br>
regular, systematic gymnasium work, and if you would only try, in
a year<br>
or so you could make a Bannister team. Theodore Roosevelt, you
know, was a<br>
puny, weakly boy, but he built himself up, and became an athlete.
If you<br>
want to please me, start now and find your event. Attempt all the
sports,<br>
all the various track and field events, and always build yourself
up by<br>
exercise in the Gym.</p>

<p>And you owe it to your Alma Mater, my son! Even if, after
conscientious<br>
effort, you fail to win your B, to know that you have given your
college<br>
and teams what help you could, will please your Dad. Remember,
the fellow<br>
who toils on the scrubs is the true hero. If you become good
enough to give<br>
the first eleven, the first nine, the first five, or the first
track squad<br>
a hard rub and a fast practice, you are serving Bannister.</p>

<p>I don't ask you to do this, Thomas, I only say that it will
make me happy<br>
just to know you are striving. If you never get beyond the
scrubs, just to<br>
hear you are serving the Gold and Green, giving your best, in
that humble<br>
unhonored way, will please me. And if, before you graduate, you
<i>can</i> win<br>
your B, I shall be so glad! Don't get discouraged, it may take
until your<br>
Senior year, but once you start, <i>stick</i>.</p>

<p>Your loving</p>

<p>DAD.</p>

<p>"Read this one, too, Butch," requested Hicks, hurriedly, as a
hail of, "Oh,<br>
you Hicks, come here!" sounded down the corridor, from Skeet
Wigglesworth's<br>
abode. "I'll be back as soon as Skeet finishes his foolishness.
Don't wait<br>
for me, though, if I am delayed, for you want to be talking
football."</p>

<p>Left alone, big Butch Brewster, who of all the collegians that
had known<br>
and loved the sunny Hicks, some now graduated, understood that
his athletic<br>
efforts, jeered good-naturedly by the students, were made because
of a<br>
great desire to win his B and make happy his Dad, read the second
letter,<br>
dated a few days before:</p>

<p>DEAR SON THOMAS:</p>

<p>You are starting the last lap, son, your Senior year, and your
final chance<br>
to win your B! Don't forget how happy it will make your Dad if
you win your<br>
letter just once! Of course, you cannot gain it in football, for
nature<br>
gave you no chance, nor in baseball; but in track work it is up
to you.<br>
Train hard, Thomas, and try to win a first place; just win your
track B,<br>
and I'll rest content!</p>

<p>Your college record gives me great pleasure. You stand at the
top in your<br>
studies, and you are vastly popular, while the Faculty speak
highly of you.<br>
Let your B come as a climax to your career, and I'll be so proud
of you.<br>
Don't forget, you are the "Class Kid" of Yale, '96, and those
sons of old<br>
Eli want you to win the letter. As to football, you cannot win
your gold B<br>
by playing three-fourths of a season's games, but you might get
in a big<br>
game, even win it, if you'll get confidence enough to tell Coach
Corridan<br>
about yourself. Don't mind the jeers of your comrades&mdash;they
just don't<br>
know how you've tried to please your Dad; you owe it to your Alma
Mater<br>
to tell, and, take my word as a football star, you have the
goods! Your<br>
peculiar prowess has won many a contest, and old Bannister needs
it this<br>
season, I hear&mdash;</p>

<p>There was more, but big Butch scarcely saw it, bewildered as
the behemoth<br>
Senior was; what new mystery had Hicks set afoot? What did Hicks,
Sr.,<br>
mean by writing, "You might get in a big game, even win it, if
you'll get<br>
confidence enough to tell Coach Corridan about yourself? You owe
it to your<br>
Alma Mater to tell, and take my word, as a football star, you
have the<br>
goods&mdash;" Why, everyone knew that T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
possessed no more<br>
football ability than a Jersey mosquito, and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>"Another Hicks mystery," groaned Butch, holding the two
letters<br>
thoughtfully. "And father and son are in it, But if Hicks don't
get his B,<br>
it will be a shame. Say, I know&mdash;"</p>

<p>A few moments later, good-hearted Butch Brewster, in the
behalf of his<br>
sunny comrade, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., was making to the Gold and
Green<br>
eleven and Coach Corridan, as eloquent a speech as that
blithesome youth,<br>
two weeks before, had made in defense of the condemned and
ostracized Thor!<br>
He read them the two letters of Hicks' beloved Dad, and told how
the cheery<br>
collegian wanted to win his B for his father's sake; graphically,
he<br>
related Hicks, Sr.'s, great ambition, and how Hicks, Jr., for
three years<br>
had vainly tried to make good at some athletic sport, and to win
his<br>
letter. Big Butch, warming to his theme, spoke of how T. Haviland
Hicks,<br>
Jr., letting the students believe that he entered every event in
the track<br>
meet of his Freshman year just for fun, had been trying to find
his event,<br>
and train for it; he explained that the festive youth, ever
sunny-natured,<br>
under the good-humored jeers of his comrades, who did not know
his real<br>
purpose, really yearned to win his B.</p>

<p>"You fellows, and you, Coach," he thundered, "all know how
Hicks, unable<br>
to make the 'Varsity, has always done humble service for old
Bannister,<br>
cheerfully, gladly; how he keeps the athletes in good spirits at
the<br>
training-table, and is always on hand after scrimmage to rub them
out. He<br>
is chock-full of college spirit, and is intensely loyal to his
Alma Mater.<br>
Why, look how he rounded up Thor&mdash;he ought to have his B for
that!"</p>

<p>Thanks to Butch's speech, the Gold and Green football stars,
most of whom<br>
were Hicks' closest friends, saw the scatter-brained,
happy-go-lucky<br>
youth in a new light; his eloquent defense of John Thorwald had
shown old<br>
Bannister that he could be serious, but the knowledge that T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., even as he made a ridiculous farce in athletics, was
ambitious<br>
to win his B, just to make his Dad happy, stunned them. For three
years,<br>
the sunny Hicks' appearance on old Bannister Field, to try for a
team, had<br>
meant a small-sized riot of jeers and good-natured ridicule at
his expense;<br>
but Hicks had always grinned &agrave; la Cheshire cat,&mdash;and
no one but good<br>
Butch Brewster, all the time, had known how in earnest the
lovable<br>
collegian was.</p>

<p>"Now," concluded Butch, "Hicks <i>may</i> win a B in track
work, if he gets a<br>
first place in the high-jump, and if so, O.K., but if he does
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" Monty Merriweather&mdash;understood, "if he
fails, then the<br>
Athletic Association ought to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Present him with a B!" said Butch, earnestly, "as a deserved
reward for<br>
his faithful loyalty and service to old Bannister's athletic
teams. Don't<br>
let him graduate without gaining his letter, and making his Dad
realize a<br>
part of his ambition&mdash;a two-thirds vote of the Athletic
Association can<br>
award him his letter, and when all the students know the truth
about his<br>
ridiculous fiasco on Bannister Field, and realize the serious
purpose<br>
beneath them all, they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll give him his B!" shouted Beef, loudly, "If he fails in
track work<br>
next spring, we'll vote him his letter, anyway!"</p>

<p>Out in the corridor, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., returning from
Skeet<br>
Wigglesworth's room and entering his own cozy quarters, could not
help<br>
hearing the conversation, as the doors of both his den and the
room across<br>
the corridor were open. A great love for his comrades came to his
impulsive<br>
heart, and a mist before his eyes, as he heard how they wanted to
vote him<br>
his B in case he failed to win it in track work; he thrilled at
Butch's<br>
speech, but&mdash;</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<img alt="bw.jpg (92K)" src="bw.jpg" height="851" width="545">
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Fellows," he startled them by appearing in the doorway,
"I&mdash;I thank you<br>
from the bottom of my heart. I couldn't help hearing, you
know&mdash;I <i>do</i><br>
appreciate your generous thoughts, but&mdash;I can't and won't
accept my B<br>
unless I win it according to the rule of the Athletic
Association."</p>

<p>A silence, and then Butch Brewster, gripping his comrade's
hand<br>
understandingly, held out to him the two letters.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, old man," he breathed, "for reading them aloud,
but I wanted<br>
the fellows to know, to appreciate you! And say, Hicks, what does
your Dad<br>
mean by saying that you are the 'Class Kid' of Yale, '96, and
that those<br>
sons of old Eli want you to win your letter? And what does he
mean by<br>
saying that you may get in a <i>big game</i>&mdash;may <i>win</i>
it&mdash;that you have<br>
the goods in football, but lack the confidence to announce it to
Coach<br>
Corridan? Also that old Bannister needs just the peculiar brand
you<br>
possess?"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., his sunny, Cheshire cat grin
illuminating his<br>
cherubic countenance, beamed on the eleven and Coach Corridan a
moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a <i>mystery</i>," he said, cheerfully. "If I
<i>do</i> gain the courage<br>
and confidence, I'll explain, but unless I do&mdash;it remains
a&mdash;<i>mystery</i>!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER VIII</p>

<p>COACH CORRIDAN SURPRISES THE ELEVEN</p>

<p>"ALL MEMBERS OF THE FIRST ELEVEN ARE<br>
URGENTLY REQUESTED TO BE PRESENT IN<br>
THE ROOM OF T. HAVILAND HICKS, JR.&mdash;<br>
AT EIGHT P. M. TONIGHT;<br>
YOU WILL BE DETAINED ONLY A FEW MINUTES,<br>
BUT LET EVERY PLAYER COME, AS A MATTER OF<br>
EXTREME IMPORTANCE WILL BE PRESENTED.<br>
PATRICK HENRY COERIDAN, HEAD-COACH."</p>

<p>"Now, what do you suppose is up Coach Corridan's sleeve?"
demanded T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., cheerfully. "Has Ballard learned our
signals, or some<br>
Bannister student sold them to a rival team, as per the usual
football<br>
story? Though the notice doth not herald it, I am to be present,
for my<br>
room is to be used, and the Coach gave me a special invitation to
cut the<br>
Gordian knot with my keen intellect."</p>

<p>The sunny Hicks, with Butch, Beef, Tug, and Monty, had just
come from<br>
"Delmonico's Annex," the college dining-hall, after supper; they
had paused<br>
before the Bulletin Board at the Gymnasium entrance, where all
college<br>
notices were posted, and the Coach's urgent request had caught
their gaze.<br>
The announcement had caused quite a stir on the campus. The
Bannister<br>
youths stood in excited groups talking of it, and in the
dormitories it<br>
superseded all thought of study; however, there seemed little
chance that<br>
any but the "'Varsity" and T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., who was always
consulted<br>
in football problems, would know what took place in this
meeting.</p>

<p>"There is only one way to find out, Hicks," responded big
Butch Brewster,<br>
his arm across his blithesome comrade's shoulders, "and that is,
attend<br>
the meeting! You can wager that every member of the eleven will
be there,<br>
except Thor&mdash;he regards it as 'foolishness,' I suppose, and
he won't spare<br>
that precious time from his studies."</p>

<p>At five minutes past eight, Butch's prophecy was fulfilled,
for every<br>
member of the eleven <i>was</i> in Hicks' cozy room, except Thor,
the Prodigious<br>
Prodigy, whose presence would have caused a mild sensation. It
was an<br>
extremely quiet and orderly gathering, for Coach Corridan, who
had the<br>
floor, was so grave that he impressed the would-be sky-larking
youths.<br>
Having their undivided attention, he proceeded to make a speech
that, to<br>
all intents and purposes, had much the same effect on the team
and Hicks as<br>
a Zeppelin's bombs on London:</p>

<p>"Boys," he spoke, in forceful sentences, driving straight to
the point,<br>
"I am going to take the eleven, and Hicks, whose suggestions are
always<br>
timely, into my confidence, in the hope that we, working
together, may<br>
carry out an idea of mine for the awakening of Thor to a
realization<br>
of things! I ask you not to let what I shall tell you be known to
the<br>
student-body, but you fellows play with Thor every day, and you
will<br>
understand the crisis, and appreciate <i>why</i> it is done, if I
decide it<br>
necessary to drop John Thorwald from the football squad."</p>

<p>"Drop Thor from the squad!" gasped T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
staggered, and<br>
then pandemonium broke loose among the players. Drop the
Prodigious Prodigy<br>
from the squad, why, what <i>could</i> the Slave-Driver be
thinking of? Why,<br>
look how Thorwald, on the scrubs, tore through the heavy 'Varsity
line for<br>
big gains. He was simply unstoppable; and yet, almost on the eve
of the big<br>
game that old Bannister depended on Thor to win by his splendid
prowess, he<br>
might be dropped from the squad! Excited exclamations sounded
from Captain<br>
Butch Brewster, Beef, and the others of the Gold and Green
eleven:</p>

<p>"Why not give the big games to Ballard and Ham, Coach?"</p>

<p>"Say, shoot Theophilus Opperdyke in at full-back!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, championship! No hopes now, fellows!"</p>

<p>"If Thor doesn't play in the Big Games&mdash;good night!"</p>

<p>A greater sensation could not have been caused even had kindly
white-haired<br>
Prexy announced his intention of challenging Jess Willard for the
World's<br>
Heavy-Weight Championship. Dropping that human battering-ram,
Thor, from<br>
the football, squad was something utterly undreamed-of. Coach
Corridan<br>
raised his hand for silence, and the youths subsided.</p>

<p>"Hear me carefully, boys," he urged, "I know that old
Bannister has come to<br>
regard John Thorwald as invincible, to use his vast bulk as a
foundation<br>
on which to build hopes of the Championship, which is a bad
policy, for no<br>
team can be a <i>one-man</i> team and win. I realize that as a
football player,<br>
Thor hasn't an equal in the State today, and if he had the right
spirit, he<br>
would have few in the country. It would be ridiculous to decry
his prowess,<br>
for he is a physical phenomenon. But you remember T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.'s,<br>
splendid defense of Thor, a week or so ago? Hicks gave you a full
and clear<br>
explanation of the big fellow, and showed you <i>why</i> he does
not know what<br>
college spirit is, what loyalty and love for one's Alma Mater
mean! His<br>
masterly speech changed your attitude toward Thor, and even
before he<br>
decided to play football, for Mr. Hicks' sake, you admired him,
because<br>
of his indomitable purpose, his promise to his dying mother. Now
I am<br>
telling you why he may be dropped from the squad, because I want
you<br>
fellows to give Thor a square deal, to remember what Hicks told
you of him,<br>
and to keep on striving to awaken him to the true meaning of
campus years,<br>
to make him realize that college life is more than a mere buying
of<br>
knowledge. I want to keep him on the squad, if humanly possible,
and I<br>
shall outline my plot later.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we play Latham College. It is the last game before
the big games<br>
for The State Intercollegiate Football Championship. Saturday
after this,<br>
we play Hamilton, and the following week Ballard, the Champions!
The eleven<br>
I send in against those teams must be a solid unit, <i>one</i> in
spirit and<br>
purpose&mdash;every member of the Gold and Green team must be
welded with his<br>
team-mates, and they must forget everything but that their Alma
Mater must<br>
win the Championship! With no thought of self-glory, no other
purpose in<br>
playing than a love for old Bannister, every fellow must go into
those<br>
games to fight for his Alma Mater! Now, as for Thor, I need not
tell you<br>
that he is not in sympathy with our ambition; he simply does not
understand<br>
campus tradition and spirit. He is as yet not possessed of an
Alma Mater;<br>
he plays football only because of gratitude to Mr. Thomas
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Sr., and he hates to lose the time from his studies for the
practice.<br>
The football squad knows that his presence is a veritable wet
blanket on<br>
enthusiasm and the team's fighting spirit."</p>

<p>It was true. That intangible shadow of something wrong,
brooding over<br>
training-table, shower-room, and Bannister Field, that
self-evident<br>
truth which almost every collegian had for days confessed to
himself yet<br>
hesitated to voice, had been given definite form by Coach
Corridan talking<br>
to the eleven. The good that Thorwald might do for the team by
his superb<br>
prowess and massive bulk was more than offset and nullified by
his<br>
attitude.</p>

<p>To the blond Colossus, daily practice was unutterable mental
torture. His<br>
mind was on his studies, to which his bulldog purpose shackled
him; he<br>
begrudged the time spent on Bannister Field; he was stolid,
silent, aloof.<br>
He scarcely ever spoke, except when addressed. He reported for
practice at<br>
the last second, went through the scrimmage like a great, dumb,
driven ox,<br>
doing as he was ordered; and when the squad was dismissed he
hurried to his<br>
room. He was among the squad, but not of them; he neither
understood nor<br>
cared about their love for old Bannister, their vast desire to
win for<br>
their Alma Mater; he played football because he was grateful to
Hicks, Sr.,<br>
for helping him to get started toward his goal, but as Coach
Corridan now<br>
told the 'Varsity, he killed the squad's enthusiasm,</p>

<p>"All of this cannot fail to damage the <i>esprit de corps</i>,
the <i>morale</i>, of<br>
the eleven," declared Coach Corridan, having outlined Thor's
attitude. "I<br>
know that every member of the squad, if Thor played the game
because of<br>
college spirit, for love of old Bannister, would rejoice at his
prowess.<br>
But as it is they are justly resentful that he is not in the
spirit of the<br>
game. What we may gain by his playing, we lose because the others
cannot do<br>
their best with his example to hurt their fighting spirit. I do
not want,<br>
nor will I have on my eleven, any player who plays for other
reasons than a<br>
love for his Alma Mater, be he a Hogan, Brickley, Thorpe, or
Mahan. I have<br>
waited, hoping Thorwald would be awakened, as Hicks explained,
but now I<br>
must act. Tomorrow's game with Latham must see Thor awakened, or
I must,<br>
for the sake of the eleven, drop him from the squad for the rest
of the<br>
season.</p>

<p>"Yet I beg of you, in case the plan I shall propose fails,
remember Hicks'<br>
appeal! Do not condemn or ostracize John Thorwald in any degree.
He has<br>
three more seasons of football, so let us keep on trying to make
him<br>
understand campus life, college tradition. Be his friends, help
him all you<br>
can, and sooner or later he will awaken. Something may suddenly
shock him<br>
to a true understanding of what old Bannister means to a fellow.
Or perhaps<br>
the awakening will be slow, but it must come. And Bannister can
win without<br>
Thor, don't forget that! We'll make one final effort to awaken
Thor, and<br>
if it fails, just forget him, boys, so far as football goes, and
watch the<br>
Gold and Green win that championship."</p>

<p>"What is your scheme, Coach?" questioned Captain Butch
Brewster, his honest<br>
countenance showing how heavily the responsibility of team-leader
weighed<br>
upon him. "You are right; as Thor is now, he is a handicap to the
eleven,<br>
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My idea is this," explained the Slave-Driver earnestly.
"Select some<br>
student to go to Thorwald and try to show him that unless he gets
into the<br>
game and plays for old Bannister, he will be dropped from the
squad. If<br>
possible, let the fellow make him understand that, in his case,
it will be<br>
a shame and a dishonor. Now, Butch, you and Hicks can probably
approach<br>
Thor, or perhaps you know of someone who&mdash;"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, cherubic countenance showed the
light of dawning<br>
inspiration, and Coach Corridan paused, as the sunny youth
exhibited a<br>
desire to say something, with him not by any means a
phenomenal<br>
happening; given the floor, the blithesome youth burst forth
excitedly:<br>
"Theophilus&mdash;Theophilus Opperdyke is the one! He has more
influence over<br>
Thor than any other student, and the big fellow likes the little
boner.<br>
Thor will at least listen to Theophilus, which Is more than any
of us can<br>
gain from him."</p>

<p>After the meeting had adjourned, and the last inspection had
been made in<br>
the other dorms, the Seniors being exempt, several members of the
Gold and<br>
Green team&mdash;Captain Butch, Beef, Pudge, Monty, Roddy, and
Bunch, together<br>
with little Theophilus Opperdyke, dragged from his
studies&mdash;foregathered in<br>
the cozy room of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.; those who had heard
the<br>
coach's talk were still stunned at the ban likely to be placed on
the<br>
Brobdingnagian Thor. On the campus outside Creighton Hall, a
horde of<br>
Bannister youths, incited by Tug Cardiff, who gave them no reason
for his<br>
act, were making a strenuous effort to awaken the Prodigious
Prodigy,<br>
evidently depending on noise to achieve that end, for a vast
sound-wave<br>
rolled up to Hicks' windows&mdash;"Rah! Rah! Rah! Thor! Thor!
Thor!<br>
He's&mdash;all&mdash;right!"</p>

<p>"Listen!" exploded T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., indignantly. "You
and I,<br>
Theophilus, would give a Rajah's ransom just to hear the fellows
whoop it<br>
up for us like that, and it has no more effect on that sodden
hulk of a<br>
Thor than bombarding an English super-dreadnaught with Roman
candles!<br>
Howsomever, Coach Corridan exploded a shrapnel bomb on old
Bannister's<br>
eleven tonight."</p>

<p>Then Hicks carefully outlined to the dazed little boner the
substance of<br>
the coach's talk to the team, and Theophilus was alarmed when he
thought of<br>
Thor's being dropped from the squad. When Captain Butch had
outlined the<br>
Slave-Driver's plot for striving to awaken the Colossus to a
realization of<br>
what a disgrace it would be to be sent from the gridiron, though
he did not<br>
announce that the Human Encyclopedia had been elected to carry
out Coach<br>
Corridan's last-hope idea, Theophilus sat on the edge of the
chair,<br>
blinking owlishly at them over his big-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>"After all, fellows," quavered Theophilus nervously, "Coach
Corridan, if he<br>
drops Thor from the squad, won't create such a riot on the campus
as you<br>
might expect. You see, the students, even as they built and
planned on<br>
Thor, gradually came to know that there is vastly more to be
considered<br>
than physical power. That great bulk actually acts as a drag on
the eleven,<br>
because Thor isn't in sympathy with things! Still, if he could
only be<br>
aroused, awakened, wouldn't the team play football, with him
striving for<br>
old Bannister, and not because he thinks he ought to play, for
Hicks' dad?<br>
Oh, I <i>do</i> hope the Coach's plan succeeds, and he awakens
tomorrow; I<br>
know the boys won't condemn him, if he doesn't,
but&mdash;I&mdash;I want him to<br>
understand!"</p>

<p>"It's his last chance this season," reflected T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
enshrouded in a penumbra of gloom. "I made a big boast that I
would round<br>
up a smashing full-back. I returned to Bannister with the
Prodigious<br>
Prodigy. I made a big mystery of him, and
then&mdash;biff!&mdash;Thor quit football.<br>
Then I explained the mystery, and got the fellows to admire him,
and when<br>
Thor decided to play the game I thought 'All O.K.; I'll just wait
until<br>
he scatters Hamilton and Ballard over Bannister Field, then I'll
swagger<br>
before Butch and say, "Oh, I told you just to leave it to
Hicks!"' But now<br>
Thor has spilled the beans again."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope that the one you have chosen to appeal to
Thor&mdash;" spoke<br>
Theophilus timorously, "will succeed, for&mdash;Oh, I
<i>don't</i> want him to be<br>
dropped from the squad, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, who had been gazing at little Theophilus
Opperdyke with<br>
a basilisk glare that perturbed the bewildered Human
Encyclopedia, suddenly<br>
strode across the room and placed his hand on the grind's thin
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Theophilus, old man, it's up to you!" he said earnestly.
"Thor has a<br>
strong regard for you; in fact, outside of his good-natured
tolerance<br>
for Hicks, you alone have his friendship. Now I want you to go to
him,<br>
Theophilus, and make a last appeal to Thor. Try to awaken him, to
make him<br>
understand his peril of being dropped from the squad, unless he
plays<br>
the game for his college! It's for old Bannister, old man, for
your Alma<br>
Mater&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go to it, Theophilus!" urged Beef McNaughton. "Coach Corridan
said Thor<br>
might be suddenly awakened by a shock, but no electric battery
can shock<br>
that Colossus, and, besides, miracles don't happen nowadays. Yes,
it's up<br>
to you, old man."</p>

<p>For a moment little Theophilus, his big-rimmed spectacles
falling off<br>
as fast as he replaced them, and his puny frame tense with
excitement,<br>
hesitated. Sitting on the extreme edge of the chair, he surveyed
his<br>
comrades solemnly and was convinced that they were in earnest.
Then, "I&mdash;I<br>
will <i>try</i>, sir!" exclaimed Theophilus, who would
<i>never</i> forget his<br>
Freshman training. "I'm <i>sure</i> Hicks, or somebody, could do
It better than<br>
I; but&mdash;I'll try!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER IX</p>

<p>THEOPHILUS' MISSIONARY WORK</p>

<p>  "College ties can ne'er be broken&mdash;<br>
  Loyal will remain each heart;<br>
  Though the last farewell be spoken&mdash;<br>
  And from Bannister we part!</p>

<p>  "Bannister, Bannister, hail, all hail!<br>
  Echoes softly from each heart;<br>
  We'll be ever loyal to thee&mdash;<br>
  Till we from life shall part!"</p>

<p>Theophilus Opperdyke, the timorous, intensely studious Human
Encyclopedia,<br>
stood at the window of John Thorwald's study room. That behemoth,
desiring<br>
quiet, had moved his study-table and chair to a vacant room
across the<br>
second-floor corridor of Creighton, the Freshman dormitory, when
the<br>
Bannister youths cheered him, and he was still there, so that
Theophilus,<br>
on his mission, had finally located him by his low rumblings, as
he<br>
laboriously read out his Latin. The little Senior was gazing
across the<br>
brightly lighted Quadrangle. He could see into the rooms of the
other<br>
class dormitories, where the students studied, skylarked,
rough-housed,<br>
or conversed on innumerable topics; from a room in Nordyke, the
abode of<br>
care-free Juniors, a splendidly blended sextette sang songs of
their<br>
Alma Mater, and their rich voices drifted across the Quad. to
Thor and<br>
Theophilus:</p>

<p>  "Though thy halls we leave forever<br>
  Sadly from the campus turn;<br>
  Yet our love shall fail thee never<br>
  For old Bannister we'll yearn!<br>
    Bannister, Bannister, hail, all hail!"</p>

<p>Theophilus turned from the window, and looked despairingly at
that young<br>
Colossus, Thor. The behemoth Norwegian, oblivious to everything
except the<br>
geometry problem now causing him to sweat, rested his massive
head on his<br>
palms, elbows on the study-table, and was lost in the intricate
labyrinth<br>
of "Let the line ABC equal the line BVD." The frail chair creaked
under his<br>
ponderous bulk. On the table lay an unopened letter that had come
in the<br>
night's mail, for, tackling one problem, the bulldog Hercules
never let go<br>
his grip until he solved it, and nothing else, not even
Theophilus, could<br>
secure his attention. Hence the Human Encyclopedia, trembling at
the<br>
terrific importance of the mission entrusted to him, waited,
thrilled by<br>
the Juniors' songs, which failed to penetrate Thor's mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, what <i>can</i> I do?" breathed Theophilus, sitting down
nervously on the<br>
edge of a chair and peering owlishly over his big-rimmed
spectacles at the<br>
stolid John Thorwald. "I am sure that, in time, I can help Thor
to&mdash;to know<br>
campus life better; but&mdash;<i>tomorrow</i> is his last chance!
He will be dropped<br>
from the squad, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Thor at last leaned back and gazed at his little comrade,
just then, to<br>
the tune of "My Old Kentucky Home," an augmented chorus drifted
across the<br>
Quadrangle:</p>

<p>  "And we'll sing one song<br>
  For the college that we love&mdash;<br>
  For our dear old Bannister&mdash;good-by"</p>

<p>To the Bannister students there was something tremendously
queer in the<br>
friendship of Theophilus and Thor. That the huge Freshman, of all
the<br>
collegians, should have chosen the timorous little boner was most
puzzling.<br>
Yet, to T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., a keen reader of human nature, it
was<br>
clear; Thorwald thought of nothing but study, Theophilus was a
grind,<br>
though he possessed intense college spirit, hence Thor was
naturally drawn<br>
to the little Senior by the mutual bond of their interest in
books, and<br>
Theophilus, with his hero-worshiping soul, intensely admired the
splendid<br>
purpose of John Thorwald, toiling to gain knowledge, because of
the promise<br>
of his dying mother. The grind, who thought that next to T.
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., Thor was the "greatest ever," as Hicks phrased it, had been,
doing<br>
what that care-free collegian termed "missionary work," with the
stolid,<br>
unimaginative Prodigious Prodigy for some weeks. Thrilled with
the thought<br>
that he worked for his Alma Mater, he quietly strove to make
Thorwald<br>
glimpse the true meaning and purpose of college life and its
broadness of<br>
development. The loyal Theophilus lost no opportunity of
impressing his<br>
behemoth friend with the sacred traditions of the campus, or of
explaining<br>
why Thor was wrong in characterizing all else than study as
foolishness and<br>
waste of time.</p>

<p>"Thor," began Theophilus timidly yet determinedly, for he was
serving old<br>
Bannister now, "old man, do you feel that you are giving the
fellows at<br>
Bannister a square deal?"</p>

<p>John Thorwald, slowly tearing open the letter that had come
that night,<br>
and had lain, unnoticed, on the study-table while he wrestled
with his<br>
geometry, turned suddenly. The Human Encyclopedia's vast
earnestness and<br>
the strange query he had fired at Thor, surprised even that
stolid mammoth.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean, Theophilus?" spoke Thor slowly. "A
square deal?<br>
Why, I owe them nothing! I sacrifice my time for them, leaving my
studies<br>
to go out and waste precious time foolishly on football.
Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean this," Theophilus kept doggedly on, his earnest desire
to stir Thor<br>
conquering his natural timidity. "You were brought to old
Bannister by<br>
Hicks, who made a great mystery of you, so we knew nothing of
you; but the<br>
fellows all thought you were willing to play football. Then,
after they<br>
got enthused, and builded hopes of the championship on
<i>you</i>, came<br>
your quitting. Hicks defended you, Thor, and changed the boys'
bitter<br>
condemnation to vast admiration, by telling of your life, your
father's<br>
being a castaway, your mother's dying wish, your toil to get
learning, and<br>
your inability to grasp college life. Then from gratitude to Mr.
Hicks you<br>
started to play again&mdash;naturally, the students waxed
enthusiastic, when you<br>
ripped the 'Varsity to pieces, but now you may be dropped by the
coach,<br>
after tomorrow, because you don't play for old Bannister, and
your<br>
indifference kills the team's fighting spirit. You do not care if
you are<br>
dropped; it will give you more time to study, and relieve you of
your<br>
obligation, as you so quixotically view it, to play because Mr.
Hicks will<br>
be glad; but&mdash;think of the fellows.</p>

<p>"They, Thor, disappointed in you, their hopes of your bringing
by your<br>
massive body and huge strength the Championship to old Bannister
shattered,<br>
are still your friends&mdash;they of the eleven, I mean
especially, for, as yet,<br>
the rest do not know you may be dropped. And the fellows came
beneath your<br>
window tonight to cheer you; they will do so, Thor, even if you
are dropped<br>
and they know that you will not use that prodigious power for
their Alma<br>
Mater in the big games; they will stand by you, for they
understand! Just<br>
think, old man; haven't the fellows, despite your rude rebuffs,
<i>tried</i><br>
to be your comrades? Haven't they helped you to get settled to
work and<br>
assisted you with your studies? Why, you have been a big boor,
cold and<br>
aloof, you have upset their hopes of you in football, and yet
they have no<br>
condemnation for you, naught but warm friendliness.</p>

<p>"You are not giving them or yourself a square deal, Thor! You
won't even<br>
<i>try</i> to understand campus life, to grasp its real purpose,
to realize what<br>
tradition is! The time will come, Thor, when you will see your
mistake; you<br>
will yearn for their good fellowship, you will learn that getting
knowledge<br>
is not all of college life. You will know that this 'silly
foolishness' of<br>
singing songs and giving the yell, of rooting for the eleven, of
loyalty<br>
and love for one's Alma Mater, is something worth while. And you
may find<br>
it out too late. Oh, if you could only understand that it isn't
what you<br>
take from old Bannister that makes a man of you, it is what you
give to<br>
your college&mdash;in athletics, in your studies, in every phase
of campus life;<br>
that in toiling and sacrificing for your Alma Mater you grow and
develop,<br>
and reap a rich reward!"</p>

<p>Could T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., Butch Brewster, and the Gold and
Green eleven<br>
have heard little Theophilus' fervent and eloquent appeal to John
Thorwald,<br>
they would have felt like giving three cheers for him. They loved
this<br>
pathetic little boner, who, because of his pitifully frail body,
could<br>
never fight for old Bannister on gridiron, diamond, or track, and
they<br>
tremendously admired him for working for his college and for the
redemption<br>
of Thor. Timorous and shrinking by nature, whenever his Alma
Mater, or a<br>
friend, needed him the Human Encyclopedia fought down his painful
timidity<br>
and came up to scratch nobly.</p>

<p>It was Theophilus whose clear logic had vastly aided T.
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., to originate The Big Brotherhood of Bannister, in 1919's
Sophomore<br>
year, and quell Roddy Perkins' Freshman Equal Rights campaign. In
fact, it<br>
had been the boner's suggestion that gave Hicks his needed
inspiration.<br>
And, a Junior, Theophilus had been elected business manager of
the<br>
Bannister Weekly, with Hicks as editor-in-chief as a colossal
joke. The<br>
entire burden of that almost defunct periodical had been thrust
on those<br>
two, and, thanks to the grind's intensely humorous "copy," the
Weekly had<br>
been revived and rebuilt. And Theophilus, in writing the humorous
articles,<br>
had been moved by a great ambition to do something for old
Bannister.</p>

<p>"Look at me, Thor!" continued Theophilus Opperdyke, his puny
body dwarfed<br>
as he faced the colossal Prodigious Prodigy. "A poor, weak,
helpless<br>
nothing! I'd cheerfully sacrifice all the scholastic honor or
glory I ever<br>
won, or shall win, just to make a touchdown for the Gold and
Green, just to<br>
win a baseball game, or to break the tape in a race for old
Bannister!<br>
And you&mdash;<i>you</i>, with that tremendous body, that massive
bulk, that vast<br>
strength&mdash;you won't play the game for your Alma Mater, you
won't throw<br>
that big frame into the scrimmage, thrilled with a desire to win
for your<br>
college! Oh, what wonderful things you <i>could</i> do with your
powerful build;<br>
but it means nothing to you, while I&mdash; Oh, you don't care,
you just won't<br>
awaken; and, unless you do, in tomorrow's game you'll be dropped
from the<br>
squad, a disgrace."</p>

<p>John Thorwald-Thor, the Prodigious Prodigy, that Gargantuan
Freshman of<br>
whom Bannister said he possessed no soul&mdash;stirred uneasily,
shifted his<br>
vast tonnage from one foot to the other, and stared at little
Theophilus<br>
Opperdyke. That solemn Senior, who had not seen the slightest
effect his<br>
"Missionary Work" was having on the stolid Thor, was in despair;
but he did<br>
not know the truth. As Hicks had once said, "You don't know
nothing what<br>
goes on in Thor's dome. There's a wall of solid concrete around
the<br>
machinery of his mind, and you can't see the wheels, belts, and
cogs at<br>
work!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., with all his keen insight into human
nature, had<br>
failed utterly to diagnose Thor's case, had not even stumbled on
the true<br>
cause of that young giant's aloofness. The truth was unknown to
anyone,<br>
but there was one natural reason for John Thorwald's not mingling
with his<br>
fellows of the campus-the blond Colossus was inordinately
bashful! From his<br>
fifteenth year, Thor had seen the seamy side of life, had lived,
grown and<br>
developed among men. In his wanderings in the Klondike, the wild
Northwest,<br>
in Panama, his experiences as cabin-boy, miner, cowboy,
lumber-jack, and<br>
Canal Zone worker, he had existed where everything was roughness
and<br>
violence, where brawn, not brain, usually held sway, where
supremacy was<br>
won, kept, and lost by fists, spiked boots, or guns! In his
adventurous<br>
career, young Thorwald had but seldom encountered the finer
things of life,<br>
and his nature, while wholesome, was sturdy and virile, not
likely to be<br>
stirred by sentiment; so that now, among the good-natured,
friendly boys of<br>
old Bannister, he, accustomed to rude surroundings and rough
acquaintances,<br>
was bashful.</p>

<p>And Theophilus, as well as T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., shot far
wide of the<br>
mark in believing that the big Hercules had no power to feel; he
possessed<br>
that power, but, with it the ability to conceal his feelings.
They thought<br>
nothing appealed to him, had stirred his soul, at college, but
they were<br>
wrong; true, Thor was unable to understand this new, strange
life; he was<br>
puzzled when the collegians condemned and ostracized him at
first, when<br>
he quit football because it was not a Faculty rule to play, but
he was<br>
grateful when Hicks defended him, and the admiration of the
student-body<br>
was welcome to him. He had thought he was doing all they desired
of him,<br>
when he went back to the game, and now&mdash;when Theophilus told
him that he<br>
might be dropped from the squad, he was bewildered. He could not
understand<br>
just why this could be, when he was reporting for scrimmage every
day!</p>

<p>But the friendliness of the youths, their kind help with his
studies,<br>
the assistance of the genial Hicks, and, more than all, above
even<br>
the admiration of the Freshmen for his promise and purpose, the
daily<br>
missionary work of little Theophilus, for whom the massive Thor
felt a real<br>
love, had been slowly, insidiously undermining John Thorwald's
reserve. No<br>
longer did he condemn what he did not understand. At times he had
a vague<br>
feeling that all was not right, that, after all, he was missing
something,<br>
that study was not all; and yet, bashful as he was, fearing to
appear<br>
rough, crude, and uncouth among these skylarking youths, Thor
kept on his<br>
silent, lonely way, and they thought him untouched by their
overtures. Of<br>
late, when unobserved, the big Freshman had stood by the window,
watching<br>
the collegians on the campus, listening to their songs of old
Bannister,<br>
and yet because he felt embarrassed when with them, he gave no
sign that he<br>
cared.</p>

<p>Now, however, the splendid appeal of loyal, timorous
Theophilus stirred<br>
Thor, and yet he could not break down the wall of reserve he had
builded<br>
around himself. He had deluded himself that this comradeship was
not for<br>
him, that he could never mingle with these happy-go-lucky youths,
that<br>
he must plod straight ahead, and live to himself, because his
past had<br>
roughened him.</p>

<p>"You are a Freshman!" spoke Theophilus, unaware that forces
were at work on<br>
Thor, and making a last effort. "You stand on the very threshold
of your<br>
campus years; everything is before you. I am at the journey's
end&mdash;very<br>
nearly, for in June I graduate from old Bannister. I never had
the chance<br>
to fight for my Alma Mater on the athletic field, and
you&mdash;Oh, think of<br>
what you can do! About to leave the campus, I, and my
class-mates, realize<br>
how dear our college has become to us. If <i>you</i> could just
know that<br>
Bannister means something to you, even now, if you only felt it,
you<br>
could make your years mean great things to you. Thor, could you
leave old<br>
Bannister tomorrow without regret, without one sigh for the dear
old place?<br>
We, who soon shall leave it forever, fully understand
Shakespeare, when in<br>
a sonnet he wrote:</p>

<p>  "This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more
strong&mdash;<br>
  To love that well which thou must leave ere long!"</p>

<p>There was a silence, and then Thor slowly drew out a letter
from its<br>
envelope, scanning the scrawl across its pages. A few moments,
while its<br>
meaning seemed to seep into his slow-acting mind, and then a look
of<br>
helpless bewilderment, as though the stolid Freshman just could
not<br>
understand at all, came to his face; a minute John Thorwald
stood, as in a<br>
trance, staring dully at the letter.</p>

<p>"Thor! Thor! What's the matter? What's wrong?" quavered the
alarmed<br>
Theophilus, "Have you gotten bad news?"</p>

<p>"Read it, read it," said the big Freshman lifelessly,
extending the letter<br>
to the startled Senior. "It's all over, I suppose, and I've got
to go to<br>
work again. I've got to leave college, and toil once more, and
save. My<br>
promise to my mother can't be fulfilled&mdash;yet. And just as I
was getting<br>
fairly started."</p>

<p>Theophilus Opperdyke hurriedly perused the message, which had
come to Thor<br>
in that night's mail but which the blond giant had let lie
unnoticed while<br>
he tackled his geometry. With difficulty Theophilus deciphered
the scrawl<br>
on an official letterhead:</p>

<p>THE NEW YORK-CHRISTIANA STEAMSHIP LINE</p>

<p>(New York Offices)</p>

<p>Nov. 4, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p>DEAR SON:</p>

<p>I am writing to tell you that I've run into a sort of
hurricane, and you<br>
and I have got a hard blow to weather. I started you at college
on the<br>
$5,000 received from the heirs of Henry B. Kingsley, on whose
yacht, as<br>
you know, I was wrecked in the South Seas, and marooned for ten
years. I<br>
figured on giving you an education with that sum, eked out by my
wages, and<br>
what you earn in vacations.</p>

<p>I had the $5,000, untouched, in a New York bank, and I wanted
to take it<br>
over to Christiania; when I was about to sail on my last voyage,
I drew out<br>
the sum, and put it in care of the Purser of the Norwhal, on
which I<br>
was mate, intending, of course, to get it on docking, and deposit
it in<br>
Christiania. At the last hour I was transferred to the Valkyrie,
to sail<br>
a few days later, and I knew the Norwhal's purser would leave the
$5,000<br>
for me in the Company's Christiania offices, so I did not bother
to<br>
transfer it to the Valkyrie.</p>

<p>Perhaps you read in the newspapers that the Norwhal struck a
floating<br>
mine, and went down with a heavy loss of life. The Purser was
among those<br>
lost, and none of the ship's papers were saved; my $5,000, of
course, went<br>
down also.</p>

<p>I am sorry, John, but there seems nothing to do but for you to
leave<br>
college and work. For your mother's sake, I wish we could avoid
it; but we<br>
must wait and work and tackle it again. Your first term expenses
are paid,<br>
so stay until the term is out. Perhaps Mr. Hicks can give you a
job in one<br>
of his steel mills again, but we must work our own way, son.
Don't lose<br>
courage, we'll fight this out together with the memory of your
promise to<br>
your dying mother to spur you on. The road may be long and rocky
but we'll<br>
make it. Just work and save, and in a year or two you can start
at college<br>
again. You can study at night, too, and keep on learning.</p>

<p>I'll write later. Stay at college till the term is up, and in
the meantime<br>
try to land a job. However, you won't have any trouble to do
that. Keep<br>
your nerve, boy, for your mother's sake. It's a hard blow, but
we'll<br>
weather it, never fear, and reach port.</p>

<p>Your father,</p>

<p>JOHN THORWALD, SR.</p>

<p>P.S. I am sailing on the Valkyrie today, will write you on my
return to<br>
New York, in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Theophilus looked at the massive young Norwegian, who had
taken this<br>
solar-plexus blow with that same stolid apathy that characterized
his every<br>
action. He wanted to offer sympathy, but he knew not how to reach
Thor. He<br>
fully understood how terrific the blow was, how it must stagger
the<br>
big, earnest Freshman, just as he, after ten years of grinding
toil, of<br>
sacrifice, of grim, unrelenting determination, had conquered
obstacles and<br>
fought to where he had a clear track ahead. Just as it seemed
that fate had<br>
given him a fair chance, with his father rescued and five
thousand dollars<br>
to give him a college course, this terrible misfortune had
befallen him.<br>
Theophilus realized what it must mean to this huge, silent
Hercules, just<br>
making good his promise to his dying mother, to give up his
studies, and go<br>
back to work, toil, labor, to begin all over again, to put off
his college<br>
years.</p>

<p>"Leave me, please," said Thor dully, apparently as unmoved by
the blow<br>
as he had been by Theophilus' appeal. "I&mdash;I would like to be
alone, for<br>
awhile."</p>

<p>Left alone, John Thorwald stood by the window, apparently not
thinking of<br>
anything in particular, as he gazed across the brightly lighted
Quad. The<br>
huge Freshman seemed in a daze&mdash;utterly unable to comprehend
the disaster<br>
that had befallen him; he was as stolid and impassive as ever,
and<br>
Theophilus might have thought that he did not care, even at
having to give<br>
up his college course, had not the Senior known better.</p>

<p>Across the Quadrangle, from the room of the Caruso-like
Juniors,<br>
accompanied by a melodious banjo-twanging, drifted:</p>

<p>  "Though thy halls we leave forever<br>
  Sadly from the campus turn;<br>
  Yet our love shall fail thee never<br>
  For old Bannister we'll yearn!</p>

<p>  "'Bannister, Bannister, hail, all hail!'<br>
  Echoes softly from each heart;<br>
  We'll be ever loyal to thee<br>
  Till we from life shall part."</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the behemoth Thorwald was not thinking so
much of having<br>
to give up his studies, of having to lay aside his books and take
up again<br>
the implements of toil. He was not pondering on the cruelty of
fate in<br>
making him abandon, at least temporarily, his goal; instead, his
thoughts<br>
turned, somehow, to his experiences at old Bannister, to the
football<br>
scrimmages, the noisy sessions in "Delmonico's Annex," the
college<br>
dining-hall, to the skylarking he had often watched in the
dormitories. He<br>
thought, too, of the happy, care-free youths, remembering Hicks,
good Butch<br>
Brewster, loyal little Theophilus; and as he reflected, he heard
those<br>
Juniors, over the way, singing. Just now they were chanting
that<br>
exquisitely beautiful Hawaiian melody, "Aloha Oe," or "Farewell
to Thee,"<br>
making the words tell of parting from their Alma Mater. There was
something<br>
in the refrain that seemed to break down Thor's wall of reserve,
to melt<br>
away his aloofness, and he caught himself listening eagerly as
they sang.</p>

<p>Somehow he felt no desire to condemn those care-free youths,
to call their<br>
singing silly foolishness, to say they were wasting their time
and their<br>
fathers' money. Queer, but he actually liked to hear them sing,
he realized<br>
he had come to listen for their saengerfests. Now that he had to
leave<br>
college, for the first time he began to ponder on what he must
leave. Not<br>
alone books and study, but&mdash;</p>

<p>As he stood there, an ache in his throat, and an awful sorrow
overwhelming<br>
him, with the richly blended voices of the happy Juniors drifting
across to<br>
him, chanting a song of old Ballard, big Thor murmured
softly:</p>

<p>"What did little Theophilus say? What was it Shakespeare
wrote? Oh, I have<br>
it:</p>

<p>  "'This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more
strong&mdash;<br>
  To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.'"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER X</p>

<p>THOR'S AWAKENING</p>

<p>  "There's a hole in the bottom of the sea,<br>
  And we'll put Bannister in that hole!<br>
  In that hole&mdash;in&mdash;that&mdash;hole&mdash;<br>
  Oh, we'll put Bannister in that hole!"</p>

<p>"In the famous words of the late Mike Murphy," said T.
Haviland Hicks, Jr.,<br>
"the celebrated Yale and Penn track trainer, 'you can beat a team
that<br>
can't be beat, but&mdash;you can't beat a team that won't be
beat!' Latham must<br>
be in the latter class."</p>

<p>It was the Bannister-Latham game, and the first half had just
ended.<br>
Captain Butch Brewster's followers had trailed dejectedly from
Bannister<br>
Field to the Gym, where Head Coach Corridan was flaying them with
a tongue<br>
as keen as the two-edged sword that drove Adam and Eve from the
Garden of<br>
Eden. A cold, bleak November afternoon, a leaden sky lowered
overhead, and<br>
a chill wind swept athwart the field; in the concrete stands, the
loyal<br>
"rooters" of the Gold and Green, or of the Gold and Blue,
shivered,<br>
stamped, and swung their arms, waiting for the excitement of the
scrimmage<br>
again to warm them. Yet, the Bannister cohorts seemed silent
and<br>
discouraged, while the Latham supporters went wild, singing,
cheering,<br>
howling. A look at the score-board explained this:</p>

<p>    END OF FIRST HALF: SCORE:<br>
      Bannister ........ 0<br>
      Latham ........... 3</p>

<p>The statement of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., swathed in a gold and
green<br>
blanket and humped on the Bannister bench, to shivering little
Theophilus<br>
Opperdyke, the Phillyloo Bird, Shad Weatherby, and several more
collegians<br>
who had joined him when the half ended, was singularly
appropriate. In<br>
Latham's light, fast eleven, trained to the minute, coached to a
shifty,<br>
tricky style of play with numberless deceptive fakes from which
they worked<br>
the forward pass successfully, Bannister seemed to have
encountered, as<br>
Mike Murphy phrased it, "A team that won't be beat!" According to
the<br>
advance dope of the sporting writers, who, in football, are
usually as good<br>
prophets as the Weather Bureau, Bannister was booked to come out
the winner<br>
by at least five touchdowns to none. But here a half was gone,
and Latham<br>
led by three points, scored on a rather lucky field-goal!</p>

<p>The psychology of football is inexplicable. Yale, beaten by
Virginia,<br>
Brown, and Wash-Jeff, with the Blue's best gridiron star
ineligible to<br>
play, a team that seemed at odds with itself and the 'Varsity,
mismanaged,<br>
poorly coached, journeys to Princeton to battle with old Nassau;
the Tiger,<br>
Its tail as yet untwisted, presents its best eleven for several
seasons, a<br>
great favorite in the odds, and yet the final score is Yale, 14;
Princeton,<br>
7! A strange fear of the Bulldog, bred of many bitter defeats, of
similar<br>
occasions when a feeble Yale team aroused itself and trampled an
invincible<br>
Orange and Black eleven, when the Blue fought old Nassau with a
team that<br>
"wouldn't" be beat, gave victory to the poorer aggregation. So
many things<br>
unforeseen often enter into a football contest, shifting the
balance of<br>
power from the stronger to the weaker team. One eleven gets the
jump on the<br>
other, the favorite weirdly goes to pieces&mdash;team dissension
may exist, a<br>
dozen other causes&mdash;but, boiled down, Mike Murphy's
statement was most<br>
appropriate now.</p>

<p>Latham simply <i>would not</i> be beat! The sporting pages had
said: "Latham<br>
simply can't beat Bannister!" Here the team, that could not be
beaten was<br>
being defeated, and the team that would not be defeated was, so
far, the<br>
victor. Perhaps the threatened dropping of Thor from the Gold and
Green<br>
squad shook somewhat Captain Butch's players; more likely, the
Latham<br>
aggregation got the jump on Bannister, opening up a bewildering
attack of<br>
criss-crosses, line plunges, cross-bucks, and tandems, from all
of which<br>
the forward pass frequently developed; they literally overwhelmed
a<br>
supposedly unbeatable team. And once they got the edge, it was
hard for<br>
Bannister to regain poise and to smother the fast plays that
swept through<br>
or around the bewildered eleven.</p>

<p>"We have <i>got</i> to beat 'em!" growled Shad, "Mike Murphy
or not. Why,<br>
if little old Latham cleans us up, smash go our chances of the
State<br>
Championship! Oh, look at Thor&mdash;the big mountain of muscle.
Why doesn't he<br>
wake up, and go push that team off the field?"</p>

<p>Thor, the Prodigious Prodigy, his vast hulk unprotected from
the cold wind<br>
by a football blanket, squatted on the ground, on the side-line,
apparently<br>
in a trance. Ever since the night before, when his father's
letter had<br>
dealt such a knock-out blow to his hopes of fulfilling the
promise to his<br>
dying mother, had rudely side-tracked him from the climb to his
goal, the<br>
blond giant had maintained that dumb apathy. If anything, it
seemed that<br>
the cruel blow of fate had only served to make Thor more stolid
and<br>
impassive than ever, and Theophilus wondered if the Colossus had
really<br>
grasped the import of the tragic letter as yet. The news had
spread over<br>
the college and campus, and the students were sincerely sorry for
Thor. But<br>
to offer him sympathy was about as difficult as consoling a Polar
bear with<br>
the toothache.</p>

<p>Coach Corridan, carrying out his plot, had decided not to
start Thor in<br>
the first half of the game. So the Norwegian Hercules, having
received no<br>
orders to the contrary, however, donned togs and appeared on the
side-line,<br>
where he had sat, paying not the slightest heed to the scrimmage
and<br>
seemingly unaware that the Gold and Green was facing defeat and
the loss of<br>
the Championship, for a game lost would put the team out of the
running.<br>
All big John Thorwald knew was, in a few weeks he must leave old
Bannister,<br>
must give up, for a time, his college course. Just when the grim
battle was<br>
won, he must leave, to work. Not that the Viking cared about
toil. It was<br>
the delay that chafed even his stolid self. He was stunned at
having to<br>
wait, maybe two years, before starting again.</p>

<p>And yet, as he squatted on the side-line, oblivious to
everything but his<br>
bitter reflections, the Theophilus-quoted words of Shakespeare
persisted in<br>
intruding on his thoughts:</p>

<p>  "This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more
strong&mdash;<br>
  To love that well, which thou must leave ere long."</p>

<p>Try as he would, he could not fight away the keen realization
that<br>
books and study were not all he would regret to leave. He was
forced to<br>
acknowledge that his mind kept wandering to other things. He
found himself<br>
pondering on the parting with Theophilus Opperdyke, with that
crazy Hicks;<br>
he wondered if he, out in the world again, toiling his lonely
way, would<br>
miss the glad fellowship of these care-free youths that he had
watched,<br>
but never shared, if he would ever think of the weeks at old
Bannister.<br>
Somehow, he felt that he would often vision the Quad at night,
brightly<br>
lighted, dormitories' lights agleam, students crossing and
recrossing,<br>
shouting at studious comrades. He would hear again the
melodious<br>
banjo-twanging, the gleeful saengerfests, the happy skylarking of
the boys.<br>
He had never entered into all this, and yet he knew he would miss
it all;<br>
why, he would even miss the daily scrimmage on Bannister Field;
the noisy<br>
shower-room, with its clouds of steam, and white forms flitting
ghostlike.<br>
He would miss the classrooms; in brief, <i>everything</i>!</p>

<p>John Thorwald was awakening! Even had this blow not befallen
him, the huge,<br>
slow-minded Norwegian, in time, with Theophilus Opperdyke's
missionary<br>
work, would have gradually come to understand things
better&mdash;at least, to<br>
know he was wrong in his ideas, which is the beginning of wisdom.
Already,<br>
he had ceased to condemn all this as foolishness, to rail at the
youths<br>
for wasting time and money. Already something stirred within him,
and yet,<br>
stolid as he was, bashful among the collegians, he was apparently
the same.<br>
But the sudden shock Head Coach Corridan spoke of had come. His
father's<br>
letter telling of his loss and that Thor must leave Bannister had
awakened<br>
him to the startling knowledge that he did care for something
more than<br>
study, that all the things that had puzzled him, that he had
sneered at,<br>
meant something to his existence, that he dreaded leaving other
things than<br>
his books.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand things," thought Thorwald.
"But&mdash;if I could only<br>
stay, I'd want to learn. I'd try to get this 'college' spirit!
Oh, I've<br>
been all wrong, but if I could only stay&mdash;"</p>

<p>As if in answer to his unspoken thought, the big Freshman
beheld marching<br>
toward him Theophilus Opperdyke, his spectacles off, and his face
aglow,<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., evidently in the throes of emotional
insanity; a<br>
Senior whom he knew as Parson Palmetter; Registrar Worthington,
and Doctor<br>
Alford, the kindly, beloved Prexy of old Bannister. The last
named placed<br>
his hand on the puzzled behemoth's ponderous shoulder.</p>

<p>"Thorwald," he said kindly, "Hicks, Opperdyke and Brewster,
last night,<br>
came to my study and acquainted me with your misfortune. They
told me of<br>
your life-history, of your splendid purpose to gain knowledge, to
make<br>
something of yourself, for your dying mother's sake. Old
Bannister needs<br>
men like you, Thorwald. Perhaps you do not understand campus ways
and<br>
tradition yet, perhaps you are not in sympathy with everything
here; but<br>
once a love for your Alma Mater is awakened, you will be a power
for good<br>
for your college.</p>

<p>"Now I at once took up the matter with Mr. Palmetter,
President of The<br>
Students' Aid Bureau. This year, for the first time in our
history, we have<br>
dispensed with janitors and sweeps in the dormitories, and with
dining-hall<br>
waiters, so that needy and deserving students may work their way
through<br>
Bannister. Owing to the fact that Mr. Deane, a Senior, has given
up his<br>
dormitory, Creighton Hall, as he has funds for the year and needs
the time<br>
to study, we can offer you board and tuition, in exchange for
your work in<br>
the dormitory, and waiting on tables in the dining-hall. Since
your first<br>
term bills, until January first, are paid, if you will start to
work at<br>
once, we will credit any work done this term on books and
incidentals for<br>
next term. By this means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you don't&mdash;you <i>can't</i> mean&mdash;" rumbled
Thor, who had just dimly<br>
grasped the greatest point in Prexy's speech. "Why, then I won't
have to<br>
leave Bannister&mdash;I won't have to quit my studies! Oh, thank
you, sir; thank<br>
you! I will work <i>so</i> hard. I am not afraid of work; I love
it&mdash;a chance to<br>
toil and earn my education, that's what I want! Thank you!"</p>

<p>"And in addition," said the Registrar, "Mr. Palmetter reports
that he can<br>
secure you, downtown, a number of furnaces to tend this winter,
which you<br>
can do early in the morning and at night; this will bring you an
income for<br>
living expenses, and in the spring something else will offer
itself. It<br>
means every moment of your time will be crowded, but Bannister
needs<br>
workers&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something stirred in John Thorwald. His heart had been touched
at last. He<br>
thought of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., Butch, and little Theophilus
worried<br>
at his having to leave college, going to Doctor Alford; of Prexy,
the<br>
Registrar, and Parson Palmetter, working to keep Thor at old
Bannister.<br>
He recalled how sympathetic all the youths had been, how they
admired his<br>
purpose and determination; and he had rewarded their friendliness
with<br>
cold aloofness. He felt a thrill as he visioned himself working
for his<br>
education, rising in the cold dawn, tending furnaces, working in
the dorm.,<br>
waiting on tables&mdash;studying. With what fierce joy he would
assail his<br>
tasks, glad that he could stay! He knew the students would
rejoice, that<br>
they would not look down on him; instead, they would respect and
admire<br>
him, toiling to grow and develop, to attain his goal!</p>

<p>"Go to it, Thor!" urged T. Haviland Hicks, Jr. "We all want
you to stay,<br>
old man; we'll give you a lift with your studies. Old Bannister
<i>wants</i><br>
you, <i>needs</i> you, so <i>stick</i>!"</p>

<p>"Stay, please!" quavered little Theophilus. "You don't want to
leave your<br>
Alma Mater; stay, Thorwald, and&mdash;you'll understand things
soon,"</p>

<p>"Report at the Registrar's office at seven tonight, Thorwald,"
said Prexy,<br>
and then, because he understood boys and campus problems, "and to
show your<br>
gratitude, you might go out there and spank that team which is
trying to<br>
lick old Bannister."</p>

<p>John Thorwald, when Doctor Alford and the Registrar had gone,
arose and<br>
stood gazing across Bannister Field. He saw not the white-lined
gridiron,<br>
the gaunt goal-posts, the concrete stands filled with spectators,
or the<br>
gay banners and pennants. He saw the buildings and campus of old
Bannister,<br>
the stately old elms bordering the walks; he beheld the Gym., the
four<br>
dormitories&mdash;Bannister, Nordyke, Smithson, and
Creighton&mdash;the white Chapel,<br>
the ivy-covered Library, the Administration and Recitation Halls;
he<br>
glimpsed the Memorial Arch over the entrance driveway, and big
Alumni Hall.<br>
All at once, like an inundating wave, the great realization
flashed on<br>
Thor that he did not have to leave it all! Often again would he
hear the<br>
skylarking youths, the gay songs, the banjo-strumming; often
would he see<br>
the brightly lighted Quad., would gaze out on the campus! It was
still<br>
his&mdash;the work, the study, and, if he tried, even the glad
comradeship of<br>
the fellows, the bigger things of college life, which as yet he
did not<br>
understand.</p>

<p>The big slow-minded youth could not awaken, at once, to a full
knowledge<br>
and understanding of campus life and tradition, to a knowledge of
college<br>
spirit; but, thanks to the belief that he had to leave it all, he
had<br>
awakened to the startling fact that already he loved old
Bannister. And<br>
now, joyous that he could stay, John Thorwald suddenly felt a
strong desire<br>
to do something, not for himself, but for these splendid fellows
who had<br>
worried for his sake, had worked to keep him at college. And just
then he<br>
remembered the somewhat unclassical, yet well meant, words of
dear old<br>
Doctor Alford, "And to show your gratitude, you might go out
there and<br>
spank that team, which is trying to lick old Bannister."</p>

<p>John Thorwald for the first time looked at the score-board; he
saw, in big<br>
white letters:</p>

<p>    BANNISTER .......... 0<br>
    LATHAM ............. 3</p>

<p>From the Gym. the Gold and Green players&mdash;grim,
determined, and yet worried<br>
by the team that "won't be beat!"&mdash;were jogging, followed by
Head Coach<br>
Patrick Henry Corridan. The Latham eleven was on the field, the
Gold and<br>
Blue rooters rioted in the stands. From the Bannister cohorts
came a<br>
thunderous appeal:</p>

<p>  "Hold 'em, boys&mdash;hold 'em,
boys&mdash;hold&mdash;hold&mdash;<i>hold</i>!<br>
  Don't let 'em beat the Green and the Gold!"</p>

<p>A sudden fury swayed the Prodigious Prodigy; it was his
college, his<br>
eleven, and those Blue and Gold youths were actually beating old
Bannister!<br>
The Bannister boys had admired him, some of them had helped him
in his<br>
studies, three had told Doctor Alford of him, had made it
possible for him<br>
to stay, to keep on toward his goal. They would be
sorrow-stricken if<br>
Latham won! A feeling of indignation came to Thor. How dare those
fellows<br>
think they could beat old Bannister! Why, <i>he</i> would go out
there and show<br>
them a few things!</p>

<p>Head Coach Corridan, let it be chronicled, was paralyzed when
he ducked<br>
under the side-line rope&mdash;stretched to hold the spectators
back&mdash;to collide<br>
with an immovable body, John Thorwald, and to behold an eager
light on that<br>
behemoth's stolid face. Grasping the Slave-Driver in a grip that
hurt, Thor<br>
boomed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Corridan, let me play, <i>please</i>! Send me out this
half. We can win.<br>
We've <i>got</i> to win! I want to do something for old
Bannister. Why, if we<br>
lose today, we lose the Championship! I don't understand things
yet, but I<br>
do love the college. I want to fight for Bannister. Please let me
play!"</p>

<p>The astonished coach and the equally dazed Gold and Green
eleven, with the<br>
bewildered collegians who heard Thor's earnest appeal, were
silent a few<br>
moments, unable to grasp the truth. Then Captain Brewster, his
face aglow,<br>
seized the big Freshman's arm excitedly.</p>

<p>"Sure you'll play, Thor!" he shouted. "Fullback, old man! Come
on, team.<br>
Thor's awake! He wants to fight for his Alma Mater; he wants
Bannister to<br>
win! Oh, watch us shove Latham off the field&mdash;everybody
together now&mdash;the<br>
yell, for Thor!"</p>

<p>"Right here," grinned an excitedly happy T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr., when the<br>
yell was given, "is where a team that won't be beat gets licked
by a chap<br>
what can lick 'em!"</p>

<p>What took place when the blond Prodigious Prodigy lumbered on
Bannister<br>
Field at the start of the last half of the Bannister-Latham game
can be<br>
imagined by the final score-board figures:</p>

<p>    BANNISTER ......... 27<br>
    LATHAM ............. 3</p>

<p>It can best be described with the aid of Scoop Sawyer's
account in the next<br>
Bannister Weekly:</p>

<p>&mdash;At the start of the second half, however, the Latham
cohorts were given<br>
a shock when they beheld a colossal being almost as big as the
entire Gold<br>
and Blue eleven, go in at fullback for Bannister. And the Latham
eleven<br>
received a series of shocks when Thor began intruding that
massive body<br>
of his into their territory. Tennyson's saying, "The old order
changeth,<br>
yielding place to new" was aptly illustrated in the second half;
for<br>
Bannister's bugler quit sounding "Retreat!" and blew "Charge!"
Four<br>
touchdowns and three goals from touchdowns, in one half, is
usually<br>
considered a fair day's work for an entire team. Even Yale or
Harvard; but<br>
when one player corrals four touchdowns in a half&mdash;he is
going some! Well,<br>
Thor went some! Most of the half he furnished free transportation
for<br>
two-thirds of the Latham team, carrying them on his back, legs,
and neck,<br>
as he strode down the field; a writ of habeas corpus could not
have stopped<br>
the blond Colossus. Anyone would have stood more show to stop an
Alpine<br>
avalanche than to slow up Thor, and the stretcher was constantly
in<br>
evidence, for Latham knockouts.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>The game turned into a Thor's Personally Conducted Tour.
Thorwald, escorted<br>
by the Gold and Green team, made four quick tours to the Latham
goal-line.<br>
It was simply a matter of giving the ball to the Prodigious
Prodigy, then<br>
waving the linesmen to move down twenty yards or more toward
Latham's line.<br>
Thor was simply unstoppable, and more beneficial even than his
phenomenal<br>
playing was his encouragement to the team. He kept urging them to
action,<br>
his foghorn growl of, "Come on, boys!" was a slogan of victory!
Judging by<br>
Thor's awakening, and his work of the Latham game, Bannister's
hopes of The<br>
State Intercollegiate Football Championship are as roseate as the
blush on<br>
a maiden's cheek at her first kiss, and&mdash;</p>

<p>That night, in the cozy room of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., John
Thorwald,<br>
supremely happy yet withal as uncomfortable as a whale on the
Sahara<br>
Desert, overflowed an easy-chair. The room was filled, or what
space Thor<br>
left, with the Bannister eleven, second-team players, Coach
Corridan, and<br>
several students; on the campus a riotous crowd of Bannister
youths "raised<br>
merry Heck," as Hicks phrased it, and their cheer floated up to
the<br>
windows:</p>

<p>"Rah! Rah! Rah! Thor! Thor! Thor!
He's&mdash;all&mdash;right!"</p>

<p>"Come, fellows," spoke T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.</p>

<p>"Let's sing to the captain, good old Butch! Let 'er go!"</p>

<p>  "Here's to good Butch Brewster! Drink it down!<br>
  Here's to good Butch Brewster! Drink It down!<br>
  Here's to good Butch Brewster&mdash;<br>
  He plays football like he <i>uster&mdash;</i><br>
  Drink it down! Drink it
down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;down!"</p>

<p>A strange sound startled the joyous youths; it was a rumbling
noise,<br>
like distant thunder, and at first they could not place it. Then,
as It<br>
continued, they located the disturbance as coming from the
prodigious body<br>
of Thor, and at last the wonderful phenomenon dawned on them.</p>

<p>"Thor is singing college songs!" quavered little Theophilus
Opperdyke,<br>
so happy that his big-rimmed spectacles rode the end of his nose.
"Oh,<br>
Hicks&mdash;Butch&mdash;Thor is awake at last! He is trying to
get college spirit, to<br>
understand campus life&mdash;"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., suddenly realized that what he had so
ardently<br>
longed for had come to pass; aided by Theophilus' missionary work
and by<br>
the sudden shock of Thorwald, Sr.'s, letter. Thor was awakened,
had come to<br>
know that he loved old Bannister. His awakening, as shown in the
football<br>
game, had been splendid. How he had towered over the scrimmage,
in every<br>
play, urging his team to fight, himself doing prodigies for old
Bannister.<br>
Thor, who had been so silent and aloof! Then the sunny-souled
youth<br>
remembered.</p>

<p>"Oh, I told you I'd awaken Thor, Butch!" he began, but that
behemoth<br>
quelled him with an ominous look.</p>

<p>"You!" he growled, with pretended wrath, "<i>you</i>! It was
Theophilus<br>
Opperdyke who did the most of it, and Thorwald's father did the
rest! Don't<br>
you rob Theophilus of his glory, you
feeble-imitation-of-some-thing-human!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., grinned &agrave; la Cheshire cat. The
happy-go-lucky<br>
Senior was vastly glad that Thor had awakened, that now he would
try<br>
to grasp the real meaning of college existence. He felt that the
young<br>
Hercules, from now on, would slowly and surely develop to a
splendid<br>
college man, that he would do big things for his Alma Mater. And
the<br>
generous Hicks gave Theophilus all the credit, and impressed on
that<br>
happy Human Encyclopedia the fact that he had done a great deed
for old<br>
Bannister. Just so, Thor was awakened.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Deke Radford, Coach, and Butch," Hicks chortled,
getting the<br>
attention of that triumvirate as well as that of the others in
the room,<br>
"remember up in Camp Bannister, in the sleep-shack, when Coach
Corridan<br>
outlined a smashing full-back he wanted?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" smiled Deke. "What of it, Hicks?"</p>

<p>Then T, Haviland Hicks, Jr., that care-free, lovable,
irrepressible youth,<br>
whose chance to swagger before this same trio had been postponed
so long<br>
and seemingly lost forever, satiated his fun-loving soul and
reaped his<br>
reward. Calling their attention to Thor, the Prodigious Prodigy,
and asking<br>
them to remember his playing against Latham that day, the sunny
Senior<br>
strutted before them vaingloriously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I told you just to leave it to Hicks!" he declared,
grinning happily.<br>
"I promised to round up an unstoppable fullback, a Gargantuan
Hercules, and<br>
I did! Just think of what he will do to Hamilton and Ballard in
the big<br>
games! As I have often told you, <i>always</i>&mdash;leave It to
Hicks!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XI</p>

<p>"ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL"</p>

<p>  "Oh, what we'll do to Ballard<br>
  Will surely be a shame!<br>
  We'll push their team clear off the field<br>
  And win the football game!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., one night three days after the first
big game, that<br>
with Hamilton, a week following Thor's great awakening in the
Latham game,<br>
sat in his cozy room, having assumed his favorite
position&mdash;chair tilted<br>
back at a perilous angle and feet thrust atop of the radiator.
The<br>
versatile youth, having just composed a song with which to
encourage<br>
Bannister elevens in the future, was reading it aloud, when his
mind was<br>
torpedoed by a most startling thought.</p>

<p>"Land o' Goshen!" reflected the sunny-souled Senior, aghast.
"I haven't<br>
twanged my ole banjo and held forth with a saengerfest for a
coon's age! I<br>
surely can do so now without arousing Butch to wrath. Thor has
awakened,<br>
Hamilton is walloped, and Bannister will surely win the
Championship!<br>
Everything is happy, an' de goose hangs high, so here goes!"</p>

<p>Holding his banjo &agrave; la troubadour, the blithesome
Hicks, who as a Senior<br>
was harassed by no study-hours or inspections, strode from his
room and out<br>
into the corridor, up and down which he majestically paced, like
a sentinel<br>
on his beat, twanging his beloved banjo with abandon, and roaring
in his<br>
foghorn, subterranean voice:</p>

<p>  "Oh, the way we walloped Hamilton<br>
  Surely was a shame!<br>
  And we're going to win the Championship&mdash;<br>
  For we'll do Ballard the same!</p>

<p>  "And Bannister shall flaunt the flag<br>
  For at least three seasons more;<br>
  Because&mdash;no team can win a game<br>
  While the Gold and Green has Thor!"</p>

<p>On Bannister Field, three days before, the Gold and Green had
crushed the<br>
strong team from "old Ham" to the tune of 20 to 0; Thor's
magnificent<br>
ground-gaining, in which he smashed through the supposedly
impregnable<br>
defense of the enemy, was a surprise to his comrades and a shock
to<br>
Hamilton. Time and again, on the fourth down, the ball was given
to<br>
Thorwald, and the blond Colossus, with several of old Ham's
players<br>
clinging to him, plunged ahead for big gains. So now with a
monster<br>
mass-meeting in half an hour, the exultant Bannister youths
pretended to<br>
study, but prepared to parade on the campus, cheer the eleven and
Thor,<br>
and arouse excitement for the winning of the biggest game, a
victory over<br>
Ballard, a week later.</p>

<p>From the rooms of would-be studious Seniors on both sides of
the corridor,<br>
as Hicks patrolled it, came vociferous protests and classic
criticisms,<br>
gathering in force and volume as the breezy youth's foghorn voice
roared<br>
his song; that heedless collegian grinned as he heard:</p>

<p>"R-r-rotten! Give that Jersey calf more rope!"</p>

<p>"Hicks has had a relapse! Sing-Sing for yours, old man!"</p>

<p>"Arrest Hicks, under the Public Nuisance Act!"</p>

<p>"Woof! Woof! Shoot it quick! Don't let it suffer!"</p>

<p>Just as T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., strumming the banjo blithely
and Carusoing<br>
with glee, reached the end of the corridor and executed a brisk
'bout-face,<br>
he heard a terrific commotion on the stairway, and, a moment
later, Butch<br>
Brewster, Beef McNaughton, Deacon Radford and Monty Merriweather
gained the<br>
top of the stairs. As they were now between the offending Hicks
and<br>
his quarters, there seemed no chance for the sunny Senior to play
his<br>
safety-first policy; so he waited, panic-stricken, as Butch and
Beef<br>
lumbered heavily down the corridor.</p>

<p>"Help! Aid! Succor! Relief! Assistance!" shrieked Hicks,
leaning his<br>
beloved banjo against the wall and throwing himself into what
he<br>
fatuously believed was an intensely pugilistic pose. "I am a
believer in<br>
preparedness. You have me cornered, so beware! I am a follower of
Henry<br>
Ford, but even I will fight&mdash;at bay!"</p>

<p>"Well, you are at <i>sea</i> now!" growled Beef, tucking the
splinter youth<br>
under one arm and striding down the corridor, followed by Butch
with the<br>
banjo, and Monty with Deacon. "You desperado, you destroyer of
peace and<br>
quietude, you one-cylinder gadabout! You're off again! We'll
instruct you<br>
to annoy real students, you faint shadow of something human!"</p>

<p>"Them's harsh sentences, Beef!" chuckled T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr., as that<br>
behemoth kicked open Hicks' door, bore the futilely squirming,
kicking<br>
youth into the room, and hurled him on the davenport. "Watch my
banjo,<br>
there, Butch; have a couple of cares! Say, what'smatter wid youse
guys,<br>
anyhow? This is my first saengerfest for eons. Old Bannister has
a clear<br>
track ahead at last, the Championship is won for <i>sure</i>, and
Thor, that<br>
mighty engine of destruction to Ham's and Ballard's hopes, after
much<br>
tinkering, is hitting on all twelve cylinders. Why, I prithee,
deny me the<br>
pleasure of a little joyous song?"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., since the memorable Latham game, when
Thor had<br>
awakened between halves, and the Prodigious Prodigy had shown
himself<br>
worthy of his title by winning the game after defeat leered at
old<br>
Bannister, had suffered a relapse, and was again his old sunny,
heedless,<br>
happy-go-lucky self. Now that John Thorwald had been startled
into<br>
realizing that he loved his college and had been saved from
having to<br>
leave, now that he played football for his Alma Mater, and
Bannister's<br>
hopes of the Championship were roseate, the blithesome Hicks had
abandoned<br>
himself to a golden existence of Beefsteak Busts downtown at
Jerry's,<br>
entertaining jolly comrades in his cozy room, and pestering the
campus with<br>
his banjo and ridiculous imitations of Sheerluck Holmes, the
Dachshund<br>
Detective. Big Butch Brewster, lecturing him for his care-free
ways, as<br>
futilely as he had done for three years past, gave up in
despair.</p>

<p>"I might as well be showing moving-pictures to the inmates of
a blind<br>
asylum," he growled on one occasion, "as to persuade you to quit
acting<br>
like a lunatic! You, a Senior&mdash;acting like an escaped
inhabitant of<br>
Matteawan! Bah!"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, drawing a chair up to the davenport,
assumed the manner<br>
of a physician toward a recalcitrant patient, while Beef
carefully stowed<br>
the banjo in the closet and Deacon Radford, an interested
spectator, sat<br>
on the bed. The happy-go-lucky Hicks, at a loss to account for
the strange<br>
expressions of his comrades, tried to arise, but the football
captain<br>
pinned him down with one hand.</p>

<p>"Seriously, Hicks," spoke Butch, "your saengerfest came at a
lamentably<br>
inopportune time! I regret to Inform you that old Bannister faces
another<br>
problem, with regard to Thor, and unless it is solved, I
fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thor has balked again?" gasped the dazed Hicks, whom Butch
now allowed to<br>
sit up, as he showed interest. "Has the engine of destruction
stalled?<br>
Why, as fast as we get him lined up, off he slides at an angle!
Well, you<br>
fellows did perfectly right to bring this baffling problem,
whatever it is,<br>
to me. What is the trouble&mdash;won't Thor play football?"</p>

<p>The irrepressible Hicks was bewildered at hearing that a new
problem<br>
regarding Thor had arisen, and, naturally, he at once connected
it with<br>
football, since the big Freshman had twice balked in that
respect. Since<br>
his awakening, effected by Theophilus' missionary work, his last
appeal,<br>
and Thor's letter from his father, Thor had earnestly striven to
grasp the<br>
true meaning of college life, to understand campus tradition. No
longer did<br>
he hold aloof, boning always, in his lonely room. Instead, he
mingled with<br>
his fellows, lingering with the team for the skylarking in the
shower-room<br>
after scrimmage, turning out for the nightly mass-meeting. Often,
as the<br>
youths practiced songs and yells on the campus, Thor's terrific
rumble was<br>
heard&mdash;some had even dared to slap his massive back and say,
"Hello, Thor,<br>
old man!" and the big Freshman had responded. It was evident to
all that<br>
Thorwald was striving to become a collegian, and knowing his
slow, bulldog<br>
nature, there was no doubt as to his ultimate success; hence T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., was vastly puzzled now.</p>

<p>"Oh, Thor hasn't backslid!" smiled Beef. "You see, Hicks, it's
this way:<br>
Owing to Mr. Thorwald's losing the five thousand dollars, Thor,
as you<br>
know, is working his way at Bannister. Well, with his hustling,
his studies<br>
and football scrimmage, he simply does not have a minute for the
other<br>
phases of college life, for the comradeship with his
fellows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here is his day's schedule," chimed in Deacon, referring to a
paper: "Rise<br>
at four-thirty A. M. Hustle downtown to tend several furnaces
until seven.<br>
Breakfast at seven. Till nine, make beds and sweep dormitory
rooms.<br>
Nine till three-fifteen P. M., recitation periods and dormitory
work,<br>
sandwiched. Then until supper, football practice, and nights
study. Add<br>
to that waiting on tables for the three meals, and what time has
Thor to<br>
broaden and develop, to take in all the big things of campus
existence, to<br>
grow into an all-round college man?"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., wonderful to chronicle, was silent. He
was<br>
reflecting on the irony of fate; as Deacon said, now that Thor
had<br>
awakened, and earnestly wanted to be a collegian, he had no time
to enter<br>
into campus life. Glad at being able to stay at old Bannister, to
keep on<br>
with his studies, climbing steadily toward his goal, and finding
a joy in<br>
his new relationship with the students, the ponderous Thorwald
had flung<br>
himself into his hustling, as the youths called working one's way
at<br>
college, with zeal. To the huge Freshman, toil was nothing, and
since it<br>
meant that he could keep on with his study, he was content. The
collegians<br>
vastly admired his grim determination; they aided all they could
with<br>
his studies, and helped with his work, so he could have more time
for<br>
scrimmage, and yet another phase of the problem came to
Hicks.</p>

<p>It seemed unjust that John Thorwald, after his long years of
hard physical<br>
toil, and his mental struggles, often after hours of grinding
work, at the<br>
very time when the five thousand dollars from Henry B. Kingsley's
heirs<br>
promised him a chance to study without a body tortured and
exhausted,<br>
should be forced again to take up his stern fight for knowledge.
And it<br>
was cruel that Thor, just awakening to the true meaning of
college life,<br>
striving to grasp campus tradition, and eager to serve his Alma
Mater in<br>
every way, should have so little time to mingle with his fellows.
He should<br>
be with them on the campus, on the athletic field, in the dorms.,
the<br>
literary society halls, the Y. M. C. A. He should be realizing
the golden<br>
years of college life, the glad comradeship of the campus.
Instead, he must<br>
arise in the bitter cold, gray dawn, and from then until late
night toil<br>
and study unceasingly.</p>

<p>"It's a howling shame!" declared the serious Hicks, a heart
full of<br>
sympathy for Thor. "Just as he wakes up and is trying to
understand things<br>
at old Bannister, bang! the Norwhal is blown up by a stray mine,
and<br>
down goes his dad's money. Why didn't Mr. Thorwald get the five
thousand<br>
transferred to the Valkyrie? Oh, if that money hadn't gone down
to Davy<br>
Jones' locker, Thor would be awakened and have time for college
life, too!"</p>

<p>Butch Brewster started to speak when the thunderous tread of
John Thorwald<br>
sounded in the corridor. The Prodigious Prodigy seemed
approaching at<br>
double-quick time, and the youths stared at each other. However,
when<br>
Thor appeared in the doorway, a letter in hand, they gazed at him
in<br>
bewilderment, for his face fairly glowed.</p>

<p>"Read it, fellows, read it!" he breathed, with what, for him,
was almost<br>
excitement. "It just came! Oh, isn't that good news? Read it out,
Captain<br>
Butch. Won't we wallop Ballard now!"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, mystified by Thor's happiness, and urged
on by his<br>
equally puzzled comrades, drew out the letter, and a glad smile
coming to<br>
his honest countenance, he read aloud:</p>

<p>"THE NEW YORK-CHRISTIANIA. STEAMSHIP LINE (New York
Office)</p>

<p>"Nov. 18, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p>"MR. JOHN THORWALD, JR., Bannister College.</p>

<p>"DEAR SIR:</p>

<p>"We beg to state that your father, first mate on our liner,
the Valkyrie,<br>
three days outbound from New York to Christiania, sent a message,
<i>via</i><br>
wireless, to our New York offices by the inbound Dutch Line's
Rotterdam.<br>
The Rotterdam relayed the message to us, and we forward it
herewith,<br>
<i>verbatim:</i></p>

<p>"'DEAR SON: Purser of my ship, the Valkyrie, informed me today
that the<br>
purser of the ill-fated Norwhal, learning of my transfer to this
liner,<br>
transferred my $5,000 to the Valkyrie before he sailed to his
fate. I am<br>
sending this <i>via</i> the Rotterdam, inbound, and our office
will forward it<br>
to you. Will write on arriving at Christiania. Father.'</p>

<p>"We are sorry for the delay in forwarding this message, but
through an<br>
accident, it was mislaid in our office for a few days.</p>

<p>"Yours truly,</p>

<p>"THE NEW YORK-CHRISTIANIA STEAMSHIP LINE,</p>

<p>"per J. L. G."</p>

<p>A moment of silence; outside on the campus the Bannister
youths, preparing<br>
for the mass-meeting in the Auditorium, started cheering. Someone
caught<br>
sight of Thor, standing now by the window of Hicks' room, on the
third<br>
floor of Bannister Hall, and a few seconds later there
sounded:</p>

<p>"Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor will bring the Championship to old
Bannister! Rah!<br>
Rah! Rah!&mdash;Thor!"</p>

<p>"Oh," shouted T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., grinning happily, his
arm across<br>
Thor's massive shoulders, "'All's well that ends well,' as Bill
Shakespeare<br>
says. It's all right now, Thor. Fate dealt you a hard punch, but
it served<br>
its purpose; for it made you realize how you would regret to
leave college.<br>
Now you won't have to hustle and have all your time filled with
toil and<br>
study; you can go after every phase of campus life, and serve old
Bannister<br>
in so many ways."</p>

<p>John Thorwald stood, a contented look on his placid, impassive
face,<br>
gazing down at the campus below and hearing the plaudits of the
excited<br>
collegians. The stately old elms, gaunt and bare, tossed their
limbs<br>
against a leaden sky; a cold, dreary wind sent clouds of dry
leaves<br>
scurrying down the concrete walks. In the faint moonlight that
struggled<br>
through the clouds, the towers and spires of old Bannister were
limned<br>
against the sky-line. Across the campus, on Bannister Field,
the<br>
goal-posts, skeleton-like, kept their lonely vigil. On that
field, in<br>
less than a week, the Gold and Green must face the crucial
test&mdash;against<br>
Ballard's championship eleven, in the Biggest Game; and now,
almost on the<br>
eve of battle, the shackles had been knocked from him; he was
free of the<br>
great burden, free to serve his Alma Mater, to fight for the Gold
and<br>
Green, to grow and develop into an all-round, representative
college man.</p>

<p>All of a sudden it dawned on the slow-thinking young Norwegian
just how<br>
much this freedom to grow and expand meant to him, and he turned
from the<br>
window. From below, the shouts of "Thor! Thor! Thor!" drifted,
stirring his<br>
blood, as he looked at Hicks, Butch, Beef, Monty and Deacon.</p>

<p>"'All's well that ends well,' you say. Hicks," he spoke
slowly, his face<br>
joyous. "That's true; but I'm just starting, fellows. I'm just
<i>beginning</i><br>
to live my college years, not for myself, but for old Bannister,
for my<br>
Alma Mater, for I am awake, and <i>free</i>!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XII</p>

<p>THEOPHILUS BETRAYS HICKS</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, a life-sized picture of despair, roosted
dejectedly on<br>
the Senior Fence, between the Gym and the Administration
Building. It was<br>
quite cold, and also the beginning of the last study-period
before Butch's<br>
final and most difficult recitation of the day, Chemistry. Yet
instead<br>
of boning in his warm room, the behemoth Senior perched on the
fence and<br>
stared gloomily into space.</p>

<p>As he sat, enveloped in a penumbra of gloom, the campus
entrance door of<br>
Bannister Hall, the Senior dorm., opened suddenly, and T.
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., that happy-go-lucky youth, came out cautiously, after the
fashion of a<br>
second-story artist, emerging from his crib with a bundle of
swag, the<br>
last item being represented by a football tucked under Hicks'
left arm.<br>
Beholding Butch Brewster on the Senior Fence, the sunny-souled
Senior<br>
exhibited a perturbation of spirit seeming undecided whether to
beat a<br>
retreat or to advance.</p>

<p>"Now what's ailin' <i>you</i>?" demanded Butch wrathily,
believing the<br>
pestersome Hicks to be acting in that burglarious manner for
effect. "Why<br>
should <i>you</i> sneak out of a dorm., bearing a football like
it was an auk's<br>
egg? Why, you resemble a nigger, making his get-away after
robbing a<br>
hen-roost! Don't torment me, you
accident-somewhere-on-its-way-to-happen. I<br>
feel about as joyous as a traveling salesman who has made a town
and gotten<br>
nary a order!"</p>

<p>"It's <i>awful</i>!" soliloquized T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
perching beside the<br>
despondent Butch on the Senior Fence. "I am not a fatalist, old
man, but<br>
it <i>does</i> seem that fate hasn't destined Thor to play
football for old<br>
Bannister this season! Here, after he won the Ham game, and we
expected him<br>
to waltz off with Ballard's scalp and the Championship, he has to
tumble<br>
downstairs! Oh, it's tough luck!"</p>

<p>It was two days before the biggest game, with
Ballard&mdash;the contest that<br>
would decide the State Intercollegiate Football Championship.
Ballard, the<br>
present champions, discounting even Hamilton's stories of Thor's
prowess,<br>
were coming to Bannister with an eleven more mighty than the one
that had<br>
crushed the Gold and Green the year before, with a heavy,
stonewall line,<br>
fast ends, and a powerful, shifty backfield. The Ballard team was
confident<br>
of victory and the pennant. Bannister, building on the awakened
Thorwald,<br>
superbly sure of his phenomenal strength and power, of his
unstoppable<br>
rushes, serenely practiced the doctrine of preparedness, and
awaited the<br>
day.</p>

<p>And then John Thorwald, the Prodigious Prodigy, whose gigantic
frame seemed<br>
unbattered by the terrific daily scrimmage, whom it was
impossible to<br>
hurt on the gridiron, the day before, going downstairs in
Creighton Hall,<br>
hurrying to a class, had caught his heel on the top step, and
crashed to<br>
the bottom! And now, with a broken ankle, the blond Colossus,
heartbroken<br>
at not being able to win the Championship for old Bannister,
hobbled about<br>
on crutches. Without Thor, the Gold and Green must meet the
invincible<br>
Ballard team! It was a solar-plexus blow, both to the Bannister
youths,<br>
confident in Thor's prowess, building on his Herculean bulk, and
to the<br>
big Freshman. Thorwald, awakened, striving to grasp campus
tradition, to<br>
understand college life, was eager to fling himself into the
scrimmage, to<br>
give every ounce of his mighty power, to offer that splendid
body, for his<br>
Alma Mater, and now he must hobble impotently on the side-line,
watching<br>
his team fight a desperate battle.</p>

<p>"If Bannister only had a sure, accurate drop-kicker!"
reflected Captain<br>
Butch hopelessly. "One who could be depended on to average eight
out of ten<br>
trials, we'd have a fighting chance with Ballard. Deke Radford is
a wonder.<br>
He can kick a forty-five-yard goal, but he's erratic! He might
boot the<br>
pigskin over when a score is needed from the forty-yard line, and
again he<br>
might miss from the twenty-yard mark. Oh, for a kicker who isn't
brilliant<br>
and spectacular, but who can methodically drop 'em over from,
say, the<br>
thirty-five-yard line! Hello, what's the row, Hicks?"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., started to speak, changed his mind,
coughed, grew<br>
red and embarrassed, and acted in a most puzzling manner. At any
other<br>
time, big Butch would have been bewildered; but with Thor's loss
weighing<br>
on his mind, the Gold and Green captain gave his comrade only a
cursory<br>
glance.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, nothing, Butch!" stammered Hicks, to
whom, being "fussed," as<br>
Bannister termed embarrassment, was almost unknown. "I&mdash;I
guess I'll<br>
take this football over to my locker in the Gym. I ought to
glance at my<br>
Chemistry, too. So-long, Butch; see you later, old top!"</p>

<p>When the splinter-youth had drifted into the Gym., Butch
Brewster,<br>
remembering his strange actions, actually managed to transfer his
thoughts<br>
for a time from the eleven to the care-free T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr. The<br>
behemoth Senior reflected that, to date, the pestiferous Hicks
had not<br>
explained his baffling mystery he recalled the day when he had
told the<br>
Gold and Green eleven of the loyal Hicks' ambition to please his
dad by<br>
winning his B, when he had described the youth's intense college
spirit<br>
and had suggested that if Hicks failed to corral his letter the
Athletic<br>
Association award him one for his loyalty to old Bannister. And
Butch saw<br>
again the bewildering sentences in the letter from Thomas
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Sr., to his son.</p>

<p>"Evidently," meditated Butch, literally and figuratively "on
the fence,"<br>
"Hicks has failed to summon up enough self-confidence to explain
his<br>
mystery; queer, too, for he usually is bubbling with faith in
himself. He<br>
has acted like a bashful schoolgirl at frequent times&mdash;he
starts to tell<br>
me something, then he gets embarrassed, back-fires, and stalls.
He and<br>
Theophilus have been sneaking out in the early dawn, too. Wow!
What did he<br>
sneak out of the dorm. that way, with a football, for? He looked
like a<br>
yeggman working night shift. Why should <i>he</i> skulk out with
a football? He<br>
has never explained his dad's letter, or told just what Mr. Hicks
meant by<br>
calling him the "Class Kid" of Yale, '96, and saying those
members of old<br>
Eli wanted him to star! Oh, he's a tantalizing wretch, and I'd
like to<br>
solve his mystery, without his knowledge, so I could&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant, to the intense indignation and bewilderment
of good Butch<br>
Brewster, little Theophilus Opperdyke, the timorous Human
Encyclopedia of<br>
old Bannister, exited from Bannister Hall. The Senior boner gave
a correct<br>
imitation of the offending Hicks, in that he skulked out, gazing
around<br>
him nervously; but he portaged no pigskin, and, unlike the sunny
youth, on<br>
periscoping Butch, he seemed relieved.</p>

<p>"Theophilus, <i>come here</i>!" thundered the wrathful
football captain,<br>
shifting his tonnage on the Senior Fence. "What's the plot,
anyhow? It's<br>
bad enough when T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., sneaks out, bearing a
football,<br>
like an amateur cracksman making a getaway; but when you appear,
imitating<br>
a Nihilist about to hurl a bomb&mdash;say, what's the answer to
the puzzle, old<br>
man?"</p>

<p>Little Theophilus, his pathetically frail body trembling with
suppressed<br>
excitement, his big-rimmed spectacles tumbling off with
ridiculous<br>
regularity, and his solemn eyes peering owlishly at his behemoth
classmate,<br>
stood before the startled Butch. It was evident that the 1919
grind<br>
labored under great stress. He was waging a terrific battle with
himself,<br>
struggling to make some vast and all-important decision. He
strove to<br>
speak, hesitated, choked, coughed apologetically, and acted as
fussed as<br>
Hicks had done, until Butch was wild; then, as if resolved to
cast the die<br>
and cross the Rubicon, he decided, and plunged desperately
ahead.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's Hicks, Butch!" he quavered, torn cruelly by
conflicting<br>
emotions. "Oh, I don't want to be a traitor&mdash;he trusted me
with his secret,<br>
and I&mdash;I can't betray him, I just can't! But he didn't make
me promise not<br>
to tell. He just told me not to. Oh, it's his very last chance,
Butch, and<br>
with Thor hurt, old Bannister might need him in the Ballard
game."</p>

<p>"What is it, Theophilus, old man?" Butch spoke kindly, for he
saw the<br>
solemn little Senior was intensely excited. "Tell me&mdash;if our
Alma Mater<br>
needs any fellow's services, you know, he should give them
freely&mdash;since<br>
you did not promise not to tell about Hicks, if Bannister may be
able<br>
to use Hicks against Ballard&mdash;though I can't, by any stretch
of the<br>
imagination, figure how&mdash;then it is your duty to tell! I
think I glimpse<br>
the dark secret&mdash;Hicks possesses some sort of football
prowess, goodness<br>
knows what, and he lacks the confidence to tell Coach Corridan!
Now, were<br>
it only drop-kicking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is drop-kicking!" Theophilus burst forth desperately.
"Hicks is a<br>
drop-kicker, Butch, and a sure one&mdash;inside the thirty-yard
line. He almost<br>
<i>never</i> misses a goal, and he kicks them from every angle,
too. He isn't<br>
strong enough to kick past the thirty-yard line, but inside that
he is<br>
wonderfully accurate. With Thor out of the Ballard game, a
drop-kick may<br>
win for Bannister, and Deke Radford is so erratic! Oh, Hicks will
be angry<br>
with me for telling; but he just won't tell about himself, after
all his<br>
practice, because he fears the fellows will jeer. He is afraid he
will fail<br>
in the supreme test. Oh, I've betrayed him, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., a drop-kicker!" exploded the dazed
Butch, who<br>
could not have been more astounded had Theophilus announced that
the sunny<br>
youth possessed powers of black magic. "Theophilus Opperdyke,
Tantalus<br>
himself was never so tantalized as I have been of late. Tell me
the whole<br>
story, old man&mdash;hurry. Spill it, old top!"</p>

<p>Butch Brewster, by questioning the excited Human Encyclopedia,
like a<br>
police official giving the third degree, slowly extracted from
Theophilus<br>
the startling story. A year before, just as the Gold and Green
practiced<br>
for the Ham game, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., one afternoon, had
arrayed his<br>
splinter-structure in a grotesque, nondescript athletic outfit,
and had<br>
jogged out on Bannister Field. The gladsome youth's motive had
been free<br>
from any torturesome purpose. He intended to round up the
Phillyloo Bird,<br>
Shad Weatherby, and other non-athletic collegians, and with them
boot the<br>
pigskin, for exercise. However, little Skeet Wigglesworth,
beholding him<br>
as he donned the weird regalia of loud sweater, odd basket-ball
stockings,<br>
tennis trousers, baseball shoes, and so on, misconstrued his
plan, and<br>
believed Hicks intended to torment the squad. Hence, he hurried
out,<br>
so that when Hicks appeared in the offing, the football squad and
the<br>
spectators in the stands had jeered the happy-go-lucky Junior,
and had<br>
good-natured sport at his expense.</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., after Jack Merritt had drop-kicked a
forty-yard<br>
goal, made the excessively rash statement that it was easy.
Captain Butch<br>
Brewster had indignantly challenged the heedless youth to show
him, and<br>
the results of Hicks' effort to propel the pigskin over the
crossbar were<br>
hilarious, for he missed the oval by a foot, nearly dislocated
his knee,<br>
and, slipping in the mud, he sat down violently with a thud.
However, so<br>
the excited Theophilus now narrated, even as the convulsed
students jeered<br>
Hicks, hurling whistles, shouts, cat-calls, songs and humorous
remarks at<br>
the downfallen kicker, one of Hicks' celebrated inspirations had
smitten<br>
the pestersome Junior, evidently jarred loose by his crashing to
terra<br>
firma.</p>

<p>"Hicks figured this way, Butch," explained little Theophilus
Opperdyke,<br>
eloquent in his comrade's behalf, "nature had built him like a
mosquito,<br>
and endowed him with enough power to lift a pillow; hence he
could never<br>
hope to play football on the 'Varsity; but he knew that many
games are<br>
won by drop-kicks and by fellows especially trained and coached
for that<br>
purpose, and they don't need weight and strength, but they must
have the<br>
art, that peculiar knack which few possess. His inspiration was
this:<br>
Perhaps he had that knack, perhaps he could practice faithfully,
and<br>
develop into a sure drop-kicker. If he trained for a year, in his
Senior<br>
season, he might be able to serve old Bannister, maybe to win a
big game.<br>
So he set to work."</p>

<p>Theophilus hurriedly yet graphically narrated how T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
had made the loyal, hero-worshiping little Human Encyclopedia his
sole<br>
confidant. He told the thrilled Butch how the sunny youth, from
that<br>
day on, had watched and listened as Head Coach Corridan trained
the<br>
drop-kickers, learning all the points he could gain. Vividly he
described<br>
the mosquito-like Hicks, as he with a football bought from the
Athletic<br>
Association began in secret to practice the fine art of
drop-kicking! For a<br>
year, at old Bannister and at his dad's country home near
Pittsburgh, Hicks<br>
had faithfully, doggedly kept at it. With no one bat Theophilus
knowing of<br>
his great ambition, he had gone out on Bannister Field, when he
felt safe<br>
from observation; here, with his faithful comrade to keep watch,
and to<br>
retrieve the pigskin, he had practiced the instructions and
points gained<br>
from watching Coach Corridan train the booters of the squad. To
his vast<br>
delight, and the joy of his little friend, Hicks had found that
he did<br>
possess the knack, and from before the Ham game until
Commencement he had<br>
kept his secret, practicing clandestinely at old Bannister; he
had improved<br>
wonderfully, and when vacation started the cheery collegian had
told his<br>
beloved dad, Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., of his hopes.</p>

<p>The ex-Yale football star, delighted at his son's ambition to
serve old<br>
Bannister and joyous at discovering that Hicks actually possessed
the<br>
peculiar knack of drop-kicking, coached the splinter-youth all
summer at<br>
their country place near Pittsburgh. Under the instruction of
Hicks, Sr.,<br>
the youth developed rapidly, and when he returned to the campus
for his<br>
final year, he was a sure, dependable drop-kicker, inside the
thirty-yard<br>
line. As Theophilus stated, beyond that he lacked the power, but
in that<br>
zone he could boot 'em over the cross-bar from any angle.</p>

<p>"He's been practicing all this season, in secret!" quavered
the little<br>
Senior, "and he's a&mdash;a <i>fiend</i>, Butch, at drop-kicking.
And yet, here it is<br>
time for the last game of his college years, and&mdash;he lacks
confidence to<br>
tell you, or Coach Corridan. Oh, I'm afraid he will be angry with
me for<br>
betraying him, and yet&mdash;I just <i>can't</i> let him miss his
splendid chance,<br>
now that Thor is out and old Bannister <i>needs</i> a
drop-kicker!"</p>

<p>Big Butch was silent for a time. The football leader was
deeply impressed<br>
and thrilled by Theophilus Opperdyke's story of T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.'s<br>
ambition. As he roosted on the Senior Fence, the behemoth
gridiron<br>
star visioned the mosquito-like youth, whom nature had endowed
with a<br>
splinter-structure, sneaking out on Bannister Field, at every
chance, to<br>
practice clandestinely his drop-kicking. He could see the
faithful Human<br>
Encyclopedia, vastly excited at his blithesome colleague's
improvement,<br>
retrieving the pigskin for Hicks. He thrilled again as he thought
of the<br>
bean-pole Hicks, who could never gain weight and strength enough
to make<br>
the eleven, loyally training and perfecting himself in the
drop-kick,<br>
trying to develop into a sure kicker, within a certain zone,
hoping<br>
sometime, before he left college forever, to serve old Bannister.
With Thor<br>
in the line-up at fullback, he would not have been needed, but
now, with<br>
the Prodigious Prodigy out, it was T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s big
chance!</p>

<p>And Butch Brewster understood why the usually confident Hicks,
even with<br>
the knowledge of his drop-kicking power, hesitated to announce it
to old<br>
Bannister. Until Butch had told the Gold and Green football team
of Hicks'<br>
being in earnest in his ridiculous athletic attempts of the past
three<br>
years, no one but himself and Hicks had dreamed that the sunny
youth meant<br>
them, that he really strove to win his B and please his dad. The
appearance<br>
of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., on Bannister Field was always the
cause of<br>
a small-sized riot among the squad and spectators. Hicks was
jeered<br>
good-naturedly, and "butchered to make a Bannister holiday," as
he blithely<br>
phrased it. Hence, the splinter-Senior was reluctant to announce
that he<br>
could drop-kick. He knew that when tested he would be so in
earnest, that<br>
so much would hang in the balance and the youths, unknowing how
important<br>
it was, would jeer. Then, too, knowing his long list of athletic
fiascos,<br>
ridiculous and otherwise, Hicks trembled at the thought of being
sent into<br>
the biggest game to kick a goal. He feared he might fail!</p>

<p>"You are a <i>hero</i>, Theophilus!" said Butch, with deep
feeling. "I can<br>
realize how hard it was for Hicks to tell us. He would have kept
silent<br>
forever, even after his training in secret! And how you must have
suffered,<br>
knowing he could drop-kick, and yet not desiring to betray him!
But your<br>
love for old Bannister and for Hicks himself conquered. I'll take
him out<br>
on the gridiron, before the fellows come from class, and see what
he<br>
can do. Aha! There is the villain now. Hicks, ahoy! Come hither,
you<br>
Kellar-Herman-Thurston. Your dark secret is out at last!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., peering cautiously from the Gym.
basement doorway,<br>
in quest of the tardy Theophilus, who was to have accompanied him
on a<br>
clandestine journey to Bannister Field, obeyed the summons.
Bewildered,<br>
and gradually guessing the explanation from the shivering little
boner's<br>
alarmed expression, the gladsome youth approached the stern Butch
Brewster,<br>
who was about to condemn him for his silence. "Don't be angry
with me,<br>
Hicks, <i>please</i>!" pled Theophilus, pathetically fearful that
he had<br>
offended his comrade, "I&mdash;I just <i>had</i> to tell, for it
was positively your<br>
last chance, and&mdash;and old Bannister needs your sure
drop-kicking! I never<br>
promised not to tell. You never made me give my word,
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was Theophilus' duty to tell!" spoke Butch, hiding a grin,
for the<br>
grind was so frightened, "and yours, Hicks, knowing as you do how
we need<br>
you, with Thor hurt! You graceless wretch, you aren't usually so
like ye<br>
modest violet! Why didn't you inform us, then swagger and say,
'Oh, just<br>
leave it to Hicks, he'll win the game with a drop-kick?' Now, you
come with<br>
me, and I'll look over your samples. If you've got the goods,
it's highly<br>
probable you'll get your chance, in the Ballard game; and I'm
<i>glad</i>, old<br>
man, for your sake. I know what it would mean, if you win it!
But&mdash;now that<br>
the '<i>mystery</i>' is solved, what's that about your being a
'Class Kid,' of<br>
Yale, '96?"</p>

<p>"That's easy!" grinned T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., his arm across
Theophilus'<br>
shoulders, "I was the first boy born to any member of Yale, '96;
it is the<br>
custom of classes graduating at Yale to call such a baby the
class kid!<br>
Naturally, the members of old Eli, Class of 1896, are vastly
interested in<br>
me. Hence, my Dad wrote they'd be tickled if I won a big game for
Bannister<br>
with a field-goal!"</p>

<p>A moment of silence, Theophilus Opperdyke, gathering from
Hicks' arm,<br>
across his shoulders, that the cheery youth was not so awfully
wrathful at<br>
his base betrayal, adjusted his big-rimmed spectacles, and stared
owlishly<br>
at Hicks.</p>

<p>"Hicks, you&mdash;you are not angry?" he quavered. "You are
not sorry. I&mdash;I<br>
told&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorry?" quoth T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., "Class Kid," of Yale,
'96, with a<br>
Cheshire cat grin, "<i>sorry</i>? I should say <i>not</i>&mdash;I
wanted it to be known to<br>
Butch, and Coach Corridan, but I got all shivery when I tried to
confess,<br>
and I&mdash;couldn't! Nay, Theophilus, you faithful friend, I'm
so <i>glad</i>, old<br>
man, that beside yours truly, the celebrated Pollyanna resembles
Niobe,<br>
weeping for her lost children."</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XIII</p>

<p>HICKS&mdash;CLASS KID&mdash;YALE '96</p>

<p>  "Brekka-kek-kek&mdash;Co-Ax&mdash;Co-Ax!<br>
  Brekka-kek-kek&mdash;Co-Ax&mdash;Co-Ax!<br>
  Whoop-up! Parabaloo! Yale! Yale! Yale!<br>
  Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., swathed in a cumbersome Gold and Green
football<br>
blanket, and crouching on the side-line, like some historic
Indian, felt a<br>
thrill shake his splinter-structure, as the yell of "old Eli"
rolled from<br>
the stand, across Bannister Field. In the midst of the Gold and
Green flags<br>
and pennants, fluttering in the section assigned the Bannister
cohorts, he<br>
gazed at a big banner of Blue, with white lettering:</p>

<p>YALE UNIVERSITY&mdash;CLASS OF 1896</p>

<p>"Oh, Butch," gasped Hicks, torn between fear and hope, "just
listen to<br>
that. Think of all those Yale men in the stand with my Dad! Oh,
suppose I<br>
do get sent in to try for a drop-kick!"</p>

<p>It was almost time far the biggest game to start, the contest
with Ballard,<br>
the supreme test of the Gold and Green, the final struggle for
The State<br>
Intercollegiate Football Championship! In a few minutes the
referee's<br>
shrill whistle blast would sound, the vast crowd in the stands,
on the<br>
side-lines, and in the parked automobiles, would suddenly still
their<br>
clamor and breathlessly await the kick-off&mdash;then, seventy
minutes of grim<br>
battling on the turf, and victory, or defeat, would perch on the
banners of<br>
old Bannister.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling scene, a sight to stir the blood. Bannister
Field, the<br>
arena where these gridiron gladiators would fly at each other's
throats&mdash;or<br>
knees, spread out&mdash;barred with white chalk-marks, with the
skeleton-like<br>
goal posts guarding at each end. On the turf the moleskin clad
warriors,<br>
under the crisp commands of their Coaches, swiftly lined down,
shifted to<br>
the formation called, and ran off plays. Nervous subs. stood in
circles,<br>
passing the pigskin. Drop-kickers and punters, tuning up, sent
spirals, or<br>
end-over-end drop-kicks, through the air. The referee,
field-judge, and<br>
linesmen conferred. Team-attendants, equipped with buckets of
water,<br>
sponges, and ominous black medicine-chests, with Red Cross
bandages, ran<br>
hither and thither. On the substitutes' bench, or on the ground,
crouched<br>
nervous second-string players; Ballard's on one side of the
gridiron, and<br>
Bannister's directly across.</p>

<p>A glorious, sunshiny day in late November, with scarcely a
breath of<br>
wind, the air crisp and bracing; the radiant sunlight fell
athwart the<br>
white-barred field, and glinted from the gay pennants and banners
in the<br>
stands! Here was a riot of color, the gold and green of old
Bannister; in<br>
the next section, the orange and black of Ballard. The bright
hues and<br>
tints of varicolored dresses, and the luster of the official
flowers<br>
all contributed to a bewilderingly beautiful spectacle!
Flower-venders,<br>
peddlers of pennants, sellers of miniature footballs with the
college<br>
colors of one team and the other, hawked their wares, loudly
calling above<br>
the tumult, "Get yer Ballard colors yere!" "This way fer the
Bannister<br>
flags!" Ten thousand spectators, packed into the cheering
sections of the<br>
two colleges, or in the general stands, or standing on the
side-lines,<br>
impatiently awaited the kick-off. At the appearance of each
football star,<br>
a tremendous cheer went up from the mass. Across the field from
each other,<br>
the two bands played stirring strains. The confident Ballard
cohorts<br>
cheered, sang, and yelled and those of Bannister, not
<i>quite</i> so sure of<br>
victory, with Thor out, nevertheless, cheered, sang, and yelled
as loudly,<br>
for the Gold and Green.</p>

<p>The sight of that vast Yale banner, so conspicuous, with its
big white<br>
letters on a field of blue, amidst the fluttering pennants of
gold and<br>
green, excited comment among the Ballard followers. The Bannister
students,<br>
however, knew what it meant; Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., and
thirty<br>
members of Yale, '96, were in the stand, ready to cheer Captain
Butch's<br>
eleven, and hoping for a chance to whoop it up for T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
if he got his big chance.</p>

<p>Two days before, when little Theophilus Opperdyke, after a
terrible<br>
struggle with himself, divided between loyalty to Hicks and a
love for<br>
his Alma Mater, had betrayed his toothpick class-mate to Captain.
Butch<br>
Brewster, that behemoth Senior had rounded up Coach Corridan, and
together<br>
they had dragged the shivering Hicks out to the football field.
Here, while<br>
the rest of the student body, unsuspecting the important event in
progress,<br>
made good use of the study-hour, or attended classes in
Recitation Hall,<br>
the Gold and Green Coach, with the team-Captain, and the excited
Human<br>
Encyclopedia, watched T. Haviland Hicks, Jr. show his samples
of<br>
drop-kicks. And the success of that happy-go-lucky youth, after
his nervous<br>
tension wore off, may be attested by the Slave-Driver's somewhat
slangy<br>
remark, when the exhibition closed.</p>

<p>"Butch," said Head Coach Patrick Henry Corridan, impressively,
"what it<br>
takes to drop-kick field-goals, from anywhere inside the
thirty-yard line,<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., is broke out with!"</p>

<p>The proficiency attained by the heedless Hicks in the
difficult art of<br>
drop-kicking, gained by faithful practice for a year, aided by
his Dad's<br>
valuable coaching, was wonderful. Of course, Hicks possessed
naturally the<br>
needed knack, but he deserved praise for his sticking at it so
loyally. He<br>
had no surety that he would ever be of use to his college, and,
indeed,<br>
with the advent of Thor, his hopes grew dim, yet he plugged on,
in case old<br>
Bannister might sometime need him&mdash;and yet, but for
Theophilus, he would<br>
not have summoned the courage to tell! To the surprise and
delight of the<br>
Coach and Captain, Hicks, after missing a few at first,
methodically booted<br>
goals over the crossbar from the ten, twenty, and thirty-yard
lines, and<br>
from the most difficult angles. There was nothing showy or
spectacular in<br>
his work, it was the result of dogged training, but he was almost
sure,<br>
when he kicked!</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<img alt="dw.jpg (89K)" src="dw.jpg" height="840" width="544">
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Good!" ejaculated Coach Corridan, his arm across Hicks'
shoulders, as they<br>
walked to the Gym. "Hicks, the chances are big that I'll send you
in to try<br>
for a goal tomorrow, if Bannister gets blocked inside the
thirty-yard line!<br>
Just keep your nerve, boy, and boot it over! Now&mdash;I'll post
a notice for<br>
a brief mass-meeting at the end of the last class period, and
Butch and I<br>
will tell the fellows about you, and how you may serve
Bannister."</p>

<p>"That's the idea!" exulted Butch, joyous at his comrade's
chance to get in<br>
the biggest game. "The fellows will understand, Hicks, old man,
and they<br>
won't jeer when you come out this afternoon. They'll root for
you! Oh, just<br>
wait until you hear them cheer you, and <i>mean</i>
it&mdash;you'll astonish the<br>
natives, Hicks!"</p>

<p>Butch's prophecy was well fulfilled. In the scrimmage that
same day, T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., shivering with apprehensive dread, his heart
in his<br>
shoes, sat on the side-line. In the stands, the entire
student-body,<br>
informed in the mass-meeting of his ability, shrieked for "Hicks!
Hicks!<br>
Hicks!" Near the end of the practice game, the hard-fighting
scrubs fought<br>
their way to the 'Varsity's thirty-yard line, and another rush
took it five<br>
yards more. Coach Corridan, halting the scrimmage, sent the
right-half-back<br>
to the side-line, and a moment later, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.
hurried out<br>
on the field with the Bannister Band playing, the collegians
yelling<br>
frenziedly, and excitement at fever height, the sunny youth took
his<br>
position in the kick formation. Then a silence, a few seconds of
suspense,<br>
as the pigskin whirled back to him, and then&mdash;a quick
stepping forward,<br>
a rip of toe against the leather, and&mdash;above the heads of
the 'Varsity<br>
players smashing through, the football shot over the
cross-bar!</p>

<p>"Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!" was the shout, "Hicks will beat
Ballard!"</p>

<p>That night, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., having crossed the
Rubicon, and<br>
committed himself to Coach Corridan and Captain Brewster, had
dispatched a<br>
telegraphic night-letter to his beloved Dad. He informed his
distinguished<br>
parent that his drop-kicking powers were now known to old
Bannister, and<br>
that the chances were fifty-fifty that he would be sent in to try
for a<br>
field-goal in the biggest game. On the day before the game, Mr.
Thomas<br>
Haviland Hicks, Sr., in a night-letter, had wired back:</p>

<p>Son Thomas:</p>

<p>Am on my way to New Haven for Yale-Harvard game. Will stop off
at old<br>
Bannister&mdash;bringing thirty members of Yale '96. We hope our
Class Kid will<br>
get his chance against Ballard.</p>

<p>Dad.</p>

<p>On the morning of the Bannister-Ballard game, Mr. Hicks'
private car the<br>
Vulcan, with the Pittsburgh "Steel King," and thirty other
members of<br>
Yale, '96, had reached town. They had ridden in state to College
Hill in<br>
good old Dan Flannagan's jitney, where T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
proudly<br>
introduced his beloved Dad to the admiring collegians. All
morning, Mr.<br>
Hicks had made friends of the hero-worshiping youths, who
listened to his<br>
tales of athletic triumphs at Bannister and at old Yale
breathlessly. The<br>
ex-Yale star had made a stirring speech to the eleven, sending
them out on<br>
Bannister Field resolved to do or die!</p>

<p>"My Dad!" breathed T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., crouched on the
side line; as<br>
he gazed at the Yale banner, he could see his father, with his
athletic<br>
figure, his strong face that could be appallingly stern or
wonderfully<br>
tender and kind. Like the sunny Senior, Mr. Hicks, despite his
wealth,<br>
was thoroughly democratic and already the Bannister collegians
were his<br>
comrades.</p>

<p>"Here we go, Hicks!" spoke Butch Brewster, as the referee
raised his<br>
whistle to his lips. "Hold yourself ready, old man; a field-goal
may win<br>
for us, and I'll send you in just as soon as I find all hope of a
touchdown<br>
is gone. If they hold us back of the thirty-yard line, I'll try
Deke<br>
Radford, but inside it, you are far more sure."</p>

<p>The vast crowd, a moment before creating an almost
inconceivable din,<br>
stilled with startling suddenness; a shrill blast from the
referee's<br>
whistle cut the air. The gridiron cleared of substitutes,
coaches,<br>
trainers, and rubbers-out, and in their places, the teams of
Bannister and<br>
Ballard jogged out. Captain Brewster won the toss, and elected to
receive<br>
the kick-off. The Gold and Green players, Butch, Beef, Roddy,
Monty, Biff,<br>
Pudge, Bunch, Tug, Hefty, Buster, and Ichabod, spread out,
fan-like,<br>
while across the center of the field the Ballard eleven, a
straight line,<br>
prepared to advance as the full-back kicked off. There was a
breathless<br>
stillness, as the big athlete poised the pigskin, tilted on end,
then<br>
strode back to his position.</p>

<p>"All ready, Ballard?" The Referee's call brought an
affirmative from the<br>
Orange and Black leader.</p>

<p>"Ready, Bannister?"</p>

<p>"Ready!" boomed big Butch Brewster, with a final shout of
encouragement to<br>
his players.</p>

<p>The biggest game was starting! Before ten thousand wildly
excited and<br>
partisan spectators, the Gold and Green and the Orange and Black
would<br>
battle for Championship honors; with Thor out of the struggle,
Ballard,<br>
three-time Champion, was the favorite. The visitors had brought
the<br>
strongest team in their history, and were supremely confident of
victory.<br>
Bannister, however, could not help remembering, twice fate had
snatched<br>
the greatest glory from their grasp, in Butch's Sophomore year,
when Jack<br>
Merritt's drop-kick struck the cross-bar, and a year later, when
Butch<br>
himself, charging for the winning touchdown, crashed blindly into
the<br>
upright. Old Bannister had not won the Championship for five
years, and<br>
now&mdash;when the chances had seemed roseate, with Thor, the
Prodigious<br>
Prodigy&mdash;smashing Hamilton out of the way, Fate had dealt
the annual blow<br>
in advance, by crippling him.</p>

<p>"Oh, we've <i>got</i> to win!" shivered T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.
"Oh, I hope I<br>
don't get sent in&mdash;I mean&mdash;I hope Bannister wins
without me! But if I <i>do</i><br>
have to kick&mdash;Oh, I hope I send it over that
cross-bar&mdash;"</p>

<p>A second later the Ballard line advanced, the fullback's toe
ripped into<br>
the pigskin, sending it whirling, high in air, far into
Bannister's<br>
territory; the yellow oval fell into the outstretched arms of
Captain<br>
Butch Brewster, on the Gold and Green's five-yard line,
and&mdash;"We're off!"<br>
shrieked Hicks, excitedly. "Come on, Butch&mdash;run it back! Oh,
we're off."</p>

<p>The biggest game had started!</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XIV</p>

<p>THE GREATER GOAL</p>

<p>"Time out!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., enshrouded in a gold and green
blanket, and<br>
standing on the side-line, like a majestic Sioux Chief, gazed out
on<br>
Bannister Field. There, on the twenty-yard line, the two lines of
scrimmage<br>
had crashed together and Bannister's backfield had smashed into
Ballard's<br>
stonewall defense with terrific impact, to be hurled back for a
five-yard<br>
loss. The mass of humanity slowly untangled, the moleskin clad
players rose<br>
from the turf, all but one. He, wearing the gold and green, lay
still,<br>
white-faced, and silent.</p>

<p>"It's Biff Pemberton!" chattered Hicks, shivering as with a
chill. "Oh, the<br>
game is lost, the Championship is gone. Biff is out, and the last
quarter<br>
is nearly ended. Coach Corridan has got to send me in to kick.
It's our<br>
very last chance to tie the score, and save old Bannister from
defeat!"</p>

<p>The time keeper, to whom the referee had megaphoned for time
out, stopped<br>
the game, while Captain Butch Brewster, the campus Doctor, and
several<br>
players worked over the senseless Biff. In the stands, the
exultant Ballard<br>
cohorts, confident that victory was booked to perch on their
banners, arose<br>
<i>en masse,</i> and their thunderous chorus drifted across
Bannister Field:</p>

<p>  "There's a hole in the bottom of the sea,<br>
  And we'll put Bannister in that hole!<br>
  In that hole&mdash;in&mdash;that&mdash;hole&mdash;<br>
  Oh, we'll put Bannister in that hole!"</p>

<p>From the Bannister section, the Gold and Green undergraduates,
alumni, and<br>
supporters, feeling a dread of approaching defeat grip their
hearts, yet<br>
determined to the last, came the famous old slogan of
encouragement to<br>
elevens battling on the gridiron:</p>

<p>  "Smash 'em, boys, run the ends&mdash;hold, boys,
<i>hold</i>&mdash;<br>
  Don't let 'em beat the Green and the Gold!<br>
  Touchdown! Touchdown! Hold, boys, <i>hold,<br>
  Don't</i> let 'em win from the Green and the Gold!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., with a groan of despair, sat down on
the deserted<br>
subs. bench. With a feeling that all was lost, the splinter-like
Senior<br>
gazed at the big score-board, announcing, in huge, white letters
and<br>
figures:</p>

<p>4TH QUARTER; TIME TO PLAY&mdash;2 MIN.; <br>
BANNISTER'S BALL ON BALLARD'S 22-YD. LINE; <br>
4TH DOWN&mdash;8 YDS. TO GAIN;<br>
SCORE: BALLARD&mdash;6; BANNISTER&mdash;3.</p>

<p>It had been a terrific contest, a biggest game never to be
forgotten by<br>
the ten thousand thrilled spectators! Each eleven had been
trained to the<br>
second for this decisive Championship fight, and with the coveted
gonfalon<br>
of glory before them, the Bannister players battled desperately,
while<br>
Ballard's fighters struggled as grimly for their Alma Mater. For
six years,<br>
the Gold and Green had failed to annex the Championship, and for
the past<br>
three, the invincible Ballard machine had rushed like a car of
Juggernaut<br>
over all other State elevens; one team was determined to wrest
the<br>
banner from its rival's grasp, and the other fully as resolved to
retain<br>
possession, hence a memorable gridiron contest, to which even the
alumni<br>
could find none in past history to compare, was the result.</p>

<p>Weakened by the loss of Thor, whose colossal bulk and
Gargantuan strength<br>
would have made victory a moral certainty, presenting practically
the same<br>
eleven that had faced Ballard the past season and had been
defeated by a<br>
scant margin, old Bannister had started the first quarter with a
furious<br>
rush that swept the enemy to midfield without the loss of a first
down.<br>
Then Ballard had rallied, stopping that triumphal march, on its
own<br>
thirty-five yard line, but unable to check Quarterback Deacon
Radford, who<br>
booted a forty-three-yard goal from a drop-kick, with the score
3-0 in<br>
Bannister's favor, and Deacon, a brilliant but erratic kicker,
apparently<br>
in fine trim, the Gold Green rooters went wild.</p>

<p>In the second half, however, came the break of the game, as
sporting<br>
writers term it. The strong Ballard eleven found itself, and with
a series<br>
of body-smashing, bone-crushing rushes, battering at the
Bannister lines<br>
like the Germans before Verdun, they steadily fought their way,
trench by<br>
trench, line by line, down the field. Without a fumble, or the
loss of a<br>
single yard, the terrific, catapulting charges forced back old
Bannister,<br>
until the enemy's fullback, who ran like the famous Johnny
Maulbetsch,<br>
of Michigan, shot headlong over the goal line! The attempt for
goal from<br>
touchdown failed, leaving the score, at the end of the third
quarter,<br>
Ballard&mdash;6; Bannister&mdash;3.</p>

<p>And Deacon Radford, whose first effort at drop-kicking had
been so<br>
brilliant, failed utterly. Three times, taking a desperate
chance, the<br>
Bannister quarter booted the pigskin, but the oval flew wide of
the goal<br>
posts, even from the thirty-yard line. With his mighty toe not to
be<br>
depended on, with the Gold and Green line worn to a frazzle by
Ballard's<br>
battering rushes, unable to beat back the victorious enemy, the
Bannister<br>
cohorts, dismayed, saw the start of the fourth and final quarter,
their<br>
last hope. The forward pass had been futile, for the visitors
were trained<br>
especially for this aerial attack, and with ease they broke up
every<br>
attempt. And then, with the ball in Ballard's possession on
Bannister's<br>
twenty-yard line, came a fumble&mdash;like a leaping tiger, Monty
Merriweather<br>
had flung himself on the elusively bounding ball, rolled over to
his feet,<br>
and was off down the field.</p>

<p>"Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!" shrieked old Bannister's
madly excited<br>
students, as Monty sprinted. "Go it,
Monty&mdash;<i>touchdown</i>! Sprint, old man,<br>
<i>sprint</i>!"</p>

<p>But Cupid Colfax, Ballard's famous sprinter, playing
quarterback, was off<br>
on Monty's trail almost instantly, and his phenomenal speed cut
down the<br>
Ballard end's advantage; still, by dint of exerting every ounce
of energy,<br>
it was on Ballard's forty-yard line that Monty Merriweather,
hugging the<br>
pigskin grimly, finally crashed to earth.</p>

<p>"Come on, Bannister!" shouted Captain Butch Brewster, as the
two teams<br>
lined down. "Right across the goal-line, then kick the goal, and
we win!<br>
Play the game&mdash;<i>fight</i>&mdash;Oh, we can win the
Championship right now."</p>

<p>Then ensued a session of football spectacular in the extreme,
replete with<br>
thrilling plays, with sensational tackles, and blood-stirring
scrimmage.<br>
The Bannister players, nerved by Captain Brewster's exhortation,
by sheer<br>
will-power drove their battered bodies into the scrimmage. End
runs,<br>
line-smashing tandem plays, forward passes, followed in
bewildering<br>
succession, until the ball rested on Ballard's twenty-yard line,
and a<br>
touchdown meant victory and the Championship for old Bannister,
Another<br>
rush, and five yards gained, then, Ballard, fighting at the last
ditch,<br>
made a stand every bit as heroic and thrilling as that
sensational march<br>
in the first half. The Gold and Green's tigerish rushes were
hurled<br>
back&mdash;three times Captain Butch threw his backfield against
the line, and<br>
three times not an inch was gained. On the third down, Monty
Merriweather<br>
was forced back for a loss, so now, with two minutes to play and
the ball<br>
in Bannister's possession, with eight yards to gain, the play was
on<br>
Ballard's twenty-two-yard line!</p>

<p>And the biggest game had produced a new hero of the gridiron.
Biff<br>
Pemberton, left half-back, imbued with savage energy, had borne
the brunt<br>
of that spectacular advance; and now, he stretched on the turf,
white and<br>
still.</p>

<p>"Hicks, old man," T, Haviland Hicks, Jr. turned as a hand
rested grippingly<br>
on his shoulder. Head Coach Patrick Henry Corridan, his face
grim, had come<br>
to him, and in quick, terse sentences, he outlined his plan.</p>

<p>"It's Bannister's last chance&mdash;" he said, tensely. "We
<i>can't</i> make the<br>
first down, the way Ballard is fighting, unless we take desperate
odds.<br>
Now, Hicks, it's <i>up to you</i>. On <i>you</i> depend old
Bannister's hopes."</p>

<p>A great, chilling fear swept over T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
leaving him weak<br>
and shaken. It had come at last-the moment for which he had
trained and<br>
practiced drop-kicking, for a year, in secret, that moment he had
hoped<br>
would come, sometime, and yet had dreaded, as in a nightmare.
Before that<br>
vast, howling crowd of ten thousand madly partisan spectators,
<i>he</i> must<br>
go out on Bannister Field, to try and boot a drop-kick from
the<br>
twenty-eight-yard-line, to save the Gold and Green from defeat.
And he<br>
thought of the great glory that would be his, if he succeeded-he
would be a<br>
campus hero, the idol of old Bannister, the youth who saved his
Alma Mater<br>
from defeat, in the biggest game! Then he remembered his Dad,
inspiring<br>
the eleven, between the halves, by a ringing speech; he heard
again his<br>
sentences:</p>

<p>"&mdash;And to serve old Bannister, to bring glory and honor
to our dear Alma<br>
Mater, is our greater goal! Go back into the game, throw
yourselves into<br>
the scrimmage, with no thought of personal glory, of the plaudits
of the<br>
crowd&mdash;it is a fine thing, a splendid goal, to play the game
and be a hero;<br>
it is a far more noble act to strive for the greater goal, one's
Alma<br>
Mater!"</p>

<p>"Now listen carefully," Coach Corridan rushed on, "Biff is
knocked out.<br>
They'll start again soon, we are going to take a desperate
chance; your Dad<br>
advises it! A tie score means the Championship stays with
Ballard. To win<br>
it, we must <i>win</i> this game&mdash;and on <i>you</i>
everything depends."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;how&mdash;" stammered Hicks, dazed&mdash;the only
way to <i>tie</i> the score was by<br>
a drop-kick; the only way to win, by a touchdown&mdash;did the
Coach mean he was<br>
<i>not</i> to realize his great ambition to save old Bannister by
a goal, the<br>
reward of his long training?</p>

<p>"You jog out," whispered Coach Corridan, hurriedly, for a
stretcher was<br>
being rushed to Biff Pemberton, "report to the Referee, and
whisper to<br>
Butch to try Formation Z; 23-45-6-A! Now, here is the dope: our
only chance<br>
is to fool Ballard completely. When you go out, the Bannister
rooters, and<br>
your Yale friends, will believe it is to try a drop-kick and tie
the score.<br>
I am sure that the Ballard team will think this, too, because of
your<br>
slender build. You act as though you intend to try for a goal,
and have<br>
Captain Butch make our fellows act that way. Then&mdash;it is a
fake-kick; the<br>
backfield lines up in the kick formation, but the ball is passed
to Butch,<br>
at your right. He either tries for a forward pass to the right
end, or<br>
if the end Is blocked, rushes it himself! Hurry-the referee's
whistle is<br>
blowing; remember, Hicks, my boy, it's the greater goal, it's for
your Alma<br>
Mater."</p>

<p>In a trance, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., flung off the gold and
green blanket,<br>
and dashed out on Bannister Field. How often, in the past year,
had he<br>
visioned this scene, only&mdash;he pictured himself saving the
game by a<br>
drop-kick, and now Coach Corridan ordered him to sacrifice this
glory! From<br>
the stands came the thunderous cheer of the excited Bannister
cohorts,<br>
firmly believing that the slender youth, so ludicrously fragile,
among<br>
those young Colossi, was to try for a goal.</p>

<p>"Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Hicks! Kick the
goal&mdash;Hicks!"</p>

<p>And from the Yale grads., among them his Dad, came a shout, as
he jogged<br>
across the turf:</p>

<p>"Breka-kek-kek&mdash;co-ax&mdash;Yale! Hicks-Hicks-Hicks!"</p>

<p>But the Bannister Senior did not thrill. Now, instead, a
feeling of growing<br>
resentment filled his soul; even this intensely loyal youth, with
all his<br>
love for old Bannister, was vastly human, and he felt cheated of
his just<br>
rights. How the students were cheering him, how those Yale men
called his<br>
name, and he was not to have his big chance! That for which he
had trained<br>
and practiced; the opportunity to serve his Alma Mater, by
kicking a goal<br>
at the crucial moment, and saving Bannister from defeat, was
never to be<br>
his. Now, in his last game at college, he was to act as a decoy,
as a foil.<br>
Like a dummy he must stand, while the other Gold and Green
athletes ran off<br>
the play! Instead of everything, a tie game, or a defeat,
depending on his<br>
kicking, defeat or victory hung on that fake play, on Butch
Brewster<br>
and Monty Merriweather! So&mdash;the ear-splitting plaudits of
the crowd for<br>
"Hicks!" meant nothing to him; they were dead sea fruit,
tasteless as<br>
ashes&mdash;as the ashes of ambition. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;And to serve old Bannister, to bring glory and honor
to our dear Alma<br>
Mater, is our greater goal&mdash;no thought of personal
glory&mdash;a splendid goal,<br>
to play the game and be a hero; It is a far more noble act to
strive for<br>
the greater goal&mdash;one's Alma Mater&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was nearly a <i>traitor</i>" gasped T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
his Dad's words<br>
echoing In his memory, and a vision of that staunch, manly
Bannister<br>
ex-athlete before him. "Oh, I was betraying my Alma Mater.
Instead of<br>
rejoicing to make <i>any</i> sacrifice, however big, for
Bannister, I thought<br>
only of myself, of my glory! I'll do it, Dad, I'll strive for the
greater<br>
goal, and&mdash;we just can't fail."</p>

<p>Reaching the scrimmage, Hicks, whose nervous dread had left
him, when<br>
he fought down selfish ambition, and thirst for glory, reported
to the<br>
Referee, and hurriedly transferred Coach Corridan's orders to
Captain<br>
Butch Brewster; half a minute of precious time was spent in
outlining the<br>
desperate play to the eleven, for "time!" had been called, and
then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Z-23-45-6-A!" shouted Quarterback Deacon Radford. "Come on,
line&mdash;hold!<br>
Right over the cross-bar with it, Hicks&mdash;tie the score, and
save Bannister<br>
from defeat&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Gold and Green backfield shifted to the kick formation.
Ten yards back<br>
of the center, on the thirty-two-yard line of Ballard, stood T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr.; the vast crowd was hushed, all eyes stared at that
slender<br>
figure, standing there, with Captain Butch Brewster at his right,
and Beef<br>
McNaughton on his left hand-the spectators believed the
frail-looking<br>
youth had been sent in to try a drop-kick. The Ballard rooters
thought<br>
it, and&mdash;the Ballard eleven were <i>sure</i> of their
enemy's plan&mdash;Hicks'<br>
mosquito-like build, his nervous swinging of that right leg,
deluded them,<br>
and helped Coach Corridan's plot.</p>

<p>It was the only play, if Bannister wanted the Championship
enough to try a<br>
desperate chance; better a fighting hope for that glory, with a
try for<br>
a touchdown, than a field-goal, and a tie-score! The lines of
scrimmage<br>
tensed. The linesmen dug their cleats in the sod, those of
Ballard tigerish<br>
to break through and block; old Bannister's determined to
<i>hold</i>. Back of<br>
Ballard's line, the backfield swayed on tip-toe, every muscle
nerved, ready<br>
to crash through; the ends prepared to knock Roddy and Monty
aside, the<br>
backs would charge madly ahead, in a berserk rush, to crash into
that slim<br>
figure.</p>

<p>"Boot it, Hicks!" shrieked Deke Radford, and as he shouted,
the pigskin<br>
shot from the Bannister center's hands; the Gold and Green line
held nobly,<br>
but not so the ends. Monty Merriweather, making a bluff at
blocking the<br>
left end, let him crash past, while he sprinted
ahead&mdash;Captain Butch<br>
Brewster, to whom the pass had been made, ran forward, until he
saw he was<br>
blocked, and then, seeing Monty dear, he hurled a beautiful
forward pass.</p>

<p>Into the arms of the waiting Monty it fell, and that Gold and
Green star,<br>
absolutely free of tacklers, sprinted twelve yards to the
goal-line,<br>
falling on the pigskin behind it! Coach Corridan's "100 to 1"
chance,<br>
suggested by Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., had succeeded,
and&mdash;the<br>
Biggest Game and the Championship had come to old Bannister at
last!</p>

<p>Followed a scene pauperizing description! For many long years
old Bannister<br>
had waited for this glory; years of bitter disappointment,
seasons when the<br>
Championship had been missed by a scant margin, a drop-kick
striking the<br>
cross-bar, Butch Brewster blindly crashing into an upright. But
now, all<br>
their pent-up joy flowed forth in a mighty torrent! Singing,
yelling,<br>
dancing, howling, the Bannister Band leading them, the Gold and
Green<br>
students, alumni, Faculty, and supporters, snake-danced around
Bannister<br>
Field. A vast, writhing, sinuous line, it wound around the
gridiron,<br>
everyone who possessed a hat flinging it over the cross-bars.
The<br>
victorious eleven, were borne by the maddened
youths&mdash;Captain Butch, Pudge,<br>
Beef, Monty, Roddy, Ichabod, Tug, Hefty, Buster, Bunch,
and&mdash;T. Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr. Ballard, firmly believing Hicks would try a
field-goal, had<br>
been taken completely off guard. Surprised by the daring attempt,
it had<br>
succeeded with ease, and the final score was Bannister&mdash;10;
Ballard&mdash;6!</p>

<p>"At last! At last!" boomed Butch Brewster, to whom this was
the happiest<br>
day of his life. "The Championship at last. My great ambition is
realized.<br>
Old Bannister has won the Championship, and I was the Team
Captain!"</p>

<p>After a time, when "the shouting and the tumult died," or at
least quieted<br>
somewhat, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., felt a hand on his arm, and
looking down<br>
from the shoulders on which he perched, he saw his Dad. Mr.
Hicks' strong<br>
face was aglow with pride and a vast joy, and he shook his son's
hand again<br>
and again.</p>

<p>"I understand, Thomas!" he said, and his words were reward
enough for the<br>
youth. "It was a <i>big</i> sacrifice, but you made it
gladly&mdash;I know! You<br>
gave up personal glory for the greater goal, and&mdash;old
Bannister won the<br>
Championship! You helped win, for the winning play turned on
<i>you</i>. It was<br>
splendid, my son, and I am proud of you! No matter if your
sacrifice is<br>
never known to the fellows, I understand."</p>

<p>A moment of silence on Hicks' part; then the sunny youth
grinned at his<br>
beloved Dad, as he responded blithesomely: "I'm Pollyanna, that
old<br>
Bannister and I won out, Dad!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XV</p>

<p>HICKS HAS A "HUNCH"</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, Seniors, Juniors, Sophomores, human
beings,<br>
and&mdash;Freshmen! Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Jr., the Olympic
High-Jump<br>
Champion, holder of the World's record, and winner at the
Panama-Pacific<br>
International Exposition National Championships, in his event, is
about to<br>
high jump! The bar is at five feet, ten inches. Mr. Hicks is the
Herculean<br>
athlete in the crazy-looking bathrobe."</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., his splinter-structure enshrouded in
that<br>
flamboyant bathrobe of vast proportions and insane colors, that
inevitably<br>
attended his athletic efforts, shaming Joseph's
coat-of-many-colors, gazed<br>
despairingly at his good friend, Butch Brewster, and Track-Coach
Brannigan,<br>
with a Cheshire cat grin on his cherubic countenance.</p>

<p>"It's no use, Butch, it's no use!" quoth he, with ludicrous
indignation,<br>
as big Tug Cardiff, the behemoth shot-putter, through a huge
megaphone<br>
imitated a Ballyhoo Bill, and roared his absurd announcement to
the<br>
hilarious crowd of collegians in the stand. "Old Bannister will
<i>never</i><br>
take my athletic endeavors seriously. Here I have won two second
places,<br>
and a third, in the high-jump this season, and have a splendid
show to<br>
annex <i>first</i> place and my track B in the Intercollegiates,
but&mdash;hear<br>
them!"</p>

<p>It was a balmy, sunshiny afternoon in late May. The
sunny-souled,<br>
happy-go-lucky T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., had trained indefatigably
for<br>
the high jump, with the result that he had won several points for
his<br>
team&mdash;however, he had not realized his great ambition of
first place, and<br>
his track letter.</p>

<p>As Hicks now exclaimed to his team-mate and Coach Brannigan,
no matter,<br>
to the howling Bannister youths, if he <i>had</i> won three
places in the high<br>
jump, in regularly scheduled meets; his comrades had been jeering
at<br>
his athletic fiascos for nearly four years, and even had Hicks
suddenly<br>
blossomed out as a star athlete, they would not have abandoned
their joyous<br>
habit. Still, those football 'Varsity players to whom good Butch
had read<br>
Hicks, Sr.'s, letters, and explained the sunny youth's
persistence, despite<br>
his ridiculous failures, though they kept on hailing his
appearance on<br>
Bannister Field with exaggerated joy, understood the care-free
collegian,<br>
and loved him for his ambition to please his Dad. Since Hicks
had<br>
absolutely refused to accept his B, for any sport, unless he won
it<br>
according to Athletic Association eligibility rules, the eleven
had kept<br>
secret the contents of the letters Butch Brewster had read to
them, for<br>
Hicks requested it.</p>

<p>The Bannister College track squad, under Track Coach Brannigan
and Captain<br>
Spike Robertson, had been training most strenuously for that
annual<br>
cinder-path classic, the State Intercollegiate Track and
Field<br>
Championships. The sprinters had been tearing down the
two-twenty<br>
straightaway like suburban commuters catching the 7.20 A.M. for
the city.<br>
Hammer-throwers and shot-putters&mdash;the weight
men&mdash;heaved the sixteen-pound<br>
shot, or hurled the hammer, with reckless abandon, like the
Strong Man of<br>
the circus. Pole-vaulters seemed ambitious to break the altitude
records,<br>
and In so doing, threatened to break their necks; hurdlers
skimmed over<br>
the standard as lightly as swallows, though no one ever beheld
swallows<br>
hurdling. The distance runners plodded determinedly around the
quarter-mile<br>
track, broad-jumpers tried to jump the length of the landing-pit.
And T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., vainly essayed to clear five-ten In the
high-jump!</p>

<p>It was the last-named event that "broke up the show," as the
Phillyloo Bird<br>
quaintly stated, somewhat wrongly, since the appearance of that
blithesome<br>
youth in the offing, his flamboyant bathrobe concealing his
shadow-like<br>
frame, had <i>started</i> the show, causing the track squad, as
well as a<br>
hundred spectator-students, to rush for seats in the stand. The
arrival<br>
of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., to train for form and height in the
high-jump,<br>
though a daily occurrence, was always the signal for a Saturnalia
of sport<br>
at his expense, because&mdash;</p>

<p>"You can't live down your athletic past, Hicks!" smiled
good-hearted Butch<br>
Brewster. "Your making a touchdown for the other eleven, by
running the<br>
wrong way with the pigskin, your hilarious fiascos in every
sport, your<br>
home-run with the bases full, on a strike-out-are specters to
haunt you.<br>
Even now that you have a chance to win your B, just listen to the
fellows."</p>

<p>The track squad's "heavy weight&mdash;white hope" section,
composed of<br>
hammer-heavers and shot-putters&mdash;Tug Cardiff, Beef
McNaughton, Pudge<br>
Langdon, Buster Brown, Biff Pemberton, Hefty Hollingsworth, and
Bunch<br>
Bingham, equipped with megaphones, and with the <i>basso
profundo</i> voices<br>
nature gave them, lined up on both sides of the
jumping-standards, and<br>
chanted loudly:</p>

<p>  "All hail to T. Haviland Hicks!<br>
  He runs like a carload of bricks;<br>
    When to high jump he tries<br>
    From the ground he can't rise&mdash;<br>
  For he's built on a pair of toothpicks!"</p>

<p>This saengerfest was greeted with vociferous cheers from the
vastly amused<br>
youths in the stands, who hailed the grinning Hicks with jeers,
cat-calls,<br>
whistles, and humorous (so they believed) remarks:</p>

<p>"Say, Hicks, you won't <i>never</i> be able to jump anything
but your<br>
board-bill!"</p>

<p>"You're built like a grass-hopper, Hicks, but you've done lost
the hop!"</p>

<p>"If you keep on improving as you've done lately, you'll make a
high-jumper<br>
in a hundred more years, old top!"</p>

<p>"You may rise in the world, Hicks, but never in the high
jump!"</p>

<p>"Don't mind them, Hicks!" spoke Coach Brannigan, his hands on
the<br>
happy-go-lucky youth's shoulders. "Listen to me; the
Intercollegiates will<br>
be the last track meet of your college years, and unless you take
first<br>
place in your event, you won't win your track B. Second, McQuade,
of<br>
Hamilton, will do five-eight, and likely an inch higher, so to
take first<br>
place, you, must do five-ten. You have trained and practiced
faithfully<br>
this season, but no matter what I do, I <i>can't</i> give you
that needed two<br>
inches, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it, Coach!" responded the chastened Hicks, throwing
aside his<br>
lurid bathrobe determinedly, and exposing to the jeering students
his<br>
splinter-frame. "Leave it to Hicks, I'll clear it this time,
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not!" fleered Butch, whom Hicks' easy self-confidence never
failed to<br>
arouse. "Hicks, listen to me, I can tell you why you can't get
two inches<br>
higher. The whole trouble with you is this; for almost four years
you have<br>
led an indolent, butterfly, care-free existence, and now, when
you must<br>
call on yourself for a special effort, you are too lazy! You can
dear<br>
five-ten; you ought to do it, but you can't summon up the energy.
I've<br>
lectured you all this time, for your heedless, easy-going ways,
and<br>
now&mdash;you pay for your idle years!"</p>

<p>"You said an encyclopedia, Butch!" agreed the Coach, with
vigor. "If only<br>
something would just <i>make</i> Hicks jump that high, if only he
could do it<br>
once, and know it is in his power, he could do it in the
Intercollegiates,<br>
aided by excitement and competition! Let something <i>scare</i>
him so that he<br>
will sail over five-ten, and&mdash;he will win his B. He has the
energy, the<br>
build, the spring, and the form, but as you say, he is so
easy-going and<br>
lazy, that his natural grass-hopper frame avails him naught."</p>

<p>"Here I go!" announced Hicks, who, to an accompaniment of loud
cheers from<br>
the stand, had been jogging up and down in that warming-up
process known to<br>
athletes as the in place run, consisting of trying to dislocate
one's<br>
jaw by bringing the knees, alternately, up against the chin. "Up
and<br>
over&mdash;that's my slogan. Just watch Hicks."</p>

<p>Starting at a distance of twenty yards from the high-jump
standards, on<br>
which the cross-bar rested at five feet, ten inches, T. Haviland
Hicks,<br>
Jr., who vastly resembled a grass-hopper, crept toward the
jumping-pit,<br>
on his toe-spikes, as though hoping to catch the cross-bar off
its guard.<br>
Advancing ten yards, he learned apparently that his design was
discovered,<br>
so he started a loping gallop, turning to a quick, mad sprint, as
though he<br>
attempted to jump over the bar before it had time to rise higher.
With a<br>
beautiful take-off, a splendid spring&mdash;a quick, writhing
twist in air, and<br>
two spasmodic kicks, the whole being known as the scissors form
of high<br>
jump, the mosquito-like youth made a strenuous effort to clear
the needed<br>
height, but&mdash;one foot kicked the cross-bar, and as Hicks
fell flat on his<br>
back, in the soft landing-pit, the wooden rod, In derision,
clattered down<br>
upon his anatomy.</p>

<p>"Foiled again!" hissed Hicks, after the fashion of a
"Ten-Twent'-Thirt'"<br>
melodrama-villain, while from the exuberant youths in the
grandstand,<br>
who really wanted Hicks to clear the bar, but who jeered at his
failure,<br>
nevertheless, sounded:</p>

<p>"Hire a derrick, Hicks, and hoist yourself over the bar!"</p>

<p>"Your <i>head</i> is light enough&mdash;your feet weigh you
down!"</p>

<p>"'Crossing the Bar'&mdash;rendered by T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr.!"</p>

<p>"Going up! Go play checkers, Hicks, you ain't no athlete!"</p>

<p>While the grinning, albeit chagrined T, Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
reposed<br>
gracefully on his back, staring up at the cross-bar, which
someone kindly<br>
replaced on the pegs, big Butch Brewster, who seemed suddenly to
have<br>
gone crazy, tried to attract Coach Brannigan's attention.
Succeeding,<br>
Butch&mdash;usually a grave, serious Senior, winked, contorted
his visage<br>
hideously, pointed at Hicks, and sibilated, "Now, Coach&mdash;now
is your<br>
chance! Tell Hicks&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tug Cardiff, Biff Pemberton, Hefty Hollingsworth, Bunch
Bingham, Buster<br>
Brown, Beef McNaughton, and Pudge Langdon, who had been attacked
in a<br>
fashion similar to Butch's spasm, concealed grins of delight, and
made<br>
strenuous efforts to appear guileless, as Track-Coach Brannigan
approached<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr. To that cheery youth, who was brushing the
dirt from<br>
his immaculate track togs, and bowing to the cheering youths in
the stand,<br>
the Coach spoke:</p>

<p>"Hicks," he said sternly, "you need a cross-country jog, to
get<br>
more strength and power in your limbs! Now, I am going to send
the<br>
Heavy-Weight-White-Hope Brigade for a four-mile run, and you go
with them.<br>
Oh, don't protest; they are all shot-putters and hammer-throwers,
but<br>
Butch, and they can't run fast enough to give a tortoise a fast
heat. Take<br>
'em out two miles and back, Butch, and jog all the way; don't let
'em loaf!<br>
Off with you,"</p>

<p>The unsuspecting Hicks might have detected the nigger in the
woodpile, had<br>
he not been so anxious to make five-ten in the high-jump.
However, willing<br>
to jog with these behemoths, with whom even he could keep pace,
so as to<br>
develop more jumping power, the blithesome youth cast aside his
garish<br>
bathrobe, pranced about in what he fatuously believed was Ted
Meredith's<br>
style, and howled:</p>

<p>"Follow Hicks! All out for the Marathon&mdash;we're off!
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;<i>go</i>!"</p>

<p>With the excited, track squad, non-athletes, and the baseball
crowd, which<br>
had ceased the game to watch the start, yelling, cheering,
howling, and<br>
whistling, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., drawing his knees up in
exaggerated<br>
style at every stride, started to lead the
Heavy-Weight-White-Hope-Brigade<br>
on its cross-country run. Without wondering why Coach Brannigan
had<br>
suddenly elected to send <i>him</i> along with the
hammer-throwers and<br>
shot-putters, on the jog, and not having seen the insane facial
contortions<br>
of the Brigade, before the Coach gave orders, the gladsome
Senior<br>
started forth in good spirits, resembling a tugboat convoying a
fleet of<br>
battleships.</p>

<p>"'Yo! Ho! Yo! Ho! And over the country we go!'" warbled Hicks,
as the squad<br>
left Bannister Field, and jogged across a green meadow.
"'&mdash;O'er hill and<br>
dale, through valley and vale, Yo! Ho! Yo! Ho! Yo! Ho!'"</p>

<p>"Save your wind, you insect!" growled Butch Brewster, with
sinister<br>
significance that escaped the heedless Hicks, as the behemoth
Butch, a<br>
two-miler, swung into the lead. "You'll <i>need</i> it, you fish,
before we get<br>
back to the campus! Not <i>too</i> fast, you flock of human
tortoises. You'll be<br>
crawling on hands and knees, if you keep that pace up long!"</p>

<p>A mile and a half passed. Butch, at an easy jog, had led his
squad over<br>
green pastures, up gentle slopes, and across a plowed field, by
way of<br>
variety. At length, he left the road on which the pachydermic
aggregation<br>
had lumbered for some distance, and turned up a long lane,
leading to a<br>
farm-house. Back of it they periscoped an orchard, with
cherry-trees,<br>
laden with red and white fruit, predominating. Also, floating
toward the<br>
collegians on the balmy May air came an ominous sound:</p>

<p>"Woof! Woof! Woof! Bow-wow-wow! Woof!"</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows!" urged Butch Brewster. "We'll jog across
old Bildad's<br>
orchard and seize some cherries&mdash;the old pirate can't catch
us, for we are<br>
attired for sprinting. Don't they look good?"</p>

<p>"Nothing stirring!" declared Hicks, slangily, but vehemently,
as he stopped<br>
short in his stride. "Old Bildad has got a bulldog what am as big
as the<br>
New York City Hall. He had it on the campus last month, you know!
Not for<br>
mine! I don't go near that house, or swipe no cherries from his
trees. If<br>
you wish to shuffle off this mortal coil, drive right ahead, but
I will<br>
await your return here."</p>

<p>T, Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, dread of dogs, of all sizes, shapes,
pedigrees,<br>
and breeds, was well known to old Bannister; hence, the
Heavy-weights now<br>
jeered him unmercifully. Old "Bildad," as the taciturn recluse
was called,<br>
who lived like a hermit and owned a rich farm, did own a massive
bulldog,<br>
and a sight of his cruel jaws was a "No Trespass" sign. With
great<br>
forethought, when cherries began to ripen, the farmer had brought
Caesar<br>
Napoleon to the campus, exhibited him to the awed youths, and
said, "My<br>
cherries be for <i>sale</i>, not to be <i>stole</i>!" which
object lesson, brief as<br>
it was, to date, had seemed to have the desired effect.
Yet&mdash;here was Butch<br>
proposing that they literally thrust their heads, or other
portions of<br>
their anatomies, into the jaws of death!</p>

<p>"Well," said Bunch Bingham at last, "I tell you what; we'll
jog up to the<br>
house and ask old Bildad to <i>sell</i> us some cherries; we can
pay him when he<br>
comes to the campus with eggs to sell, Come along. Hicks, I'll
beard the<br>
bulldog in his kennel."</p>

<p>So, dragged along by the bulky hammer-throwers and
shot-putters, the<br>
protesting T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., in mortal terror of Caesar
Napoleon, and<br>
the other canine guardians of old Bildad's property, progressed
up the lane<br>
toward the house.</p>

<p>"I got a hunch," said the reluctant Hicks, sadly, "that things
ain't<br>
a-comin' out right! In the words of the immortal
Somebody-Or-Other, 'This<br>
'ere ain't none o' <i>my</i> doin'; it's a-bein' thrust on me!'
All right, my<br>
comrades, I'll be the innocent bystander, but heed me&mdash;look
out for the<br>
bulldog!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XVI</p>

<p>THANKS TO CAESAR NAPOLEON</p>

<p>The Heavy-Weight-White-Hope-Brigade, towing the mosquito-like
T. Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., advanced on the stronghold of old Bildad, so named
because he<br>
was a pessimistic Job's comforter, like Bildad, the Shuhite, of
old&mdash;like<br>
a flock of German spies reconnoitering Allied trenches. Hearing
the house,<br>
with Butch and Beef holding the helpless, but loudly protesting
Hicks, who<br>
would fain have executed what may mildly be termed a strategic
retreat, big<br>
Tug Cardiff boldly marched, in close formation, toward the door,
when the<br>
portal suddenly flew open.</p>

<p>"Woof! Woof! Bow! Wow! Woof! Let go, Butch&mdash;there's the
dog!"</p>

<p>Amid ferocious howls from Caesar Napoleon, and alarmed
protests from the<br>
paralyzed Hicks, who could not have run, with his wobbly knees,
had he<br>
been set free by his captors, old Bildad, towed from the house by
Caesar<br>
Napoleon, who strained savagely at the leash until his face
bulged, burst<br>
upon the scene with impressive dramatic effect! It was difficult
to decide,<br>
without due consideration, which was the more interesting.
Bildad, a huge,<br>
gnarled old Viking, with matted gray hair, bushy eyebrows, a
flowing beard,<br>
and leathery face, a fierce-looking giant, was appalling to
behold, but so<br>
was Caesar Napoleon, an immense bulldog, cruel, bloodthirsty, his
massive<br>
jaws working convulsively, his ugly fangs gleaming, as he set his
great<br>
body against the leash, and gave evidence of a sincere desire to
make free<br>
lunch of the Bannister youths. As Buster Brown afterward stated,
"Neither<br>
one would take the booby prize at a beauty show, but at that, the
bulldog<br>
had a better chance than Bildad!" T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., let it
be<br>
recorded, could not have qualified as a judge, since his
undivided<br>
attention was awarded to Caesar Napoleon!</p>

<p>"What d'ye want round here, ye rapscallions?" demanded Bildad,
courteously,<br>
holding the savage bulldog with one hand, and constructing a
ponderous<br>
fist with the other, "Hike&mdash;git off'n my land, y'hear? Git,
er Caesar<br>
Napoleon'll git holt o' them scanty duds ye got on!"</p>

<p>"We want to&mdash;to buy some cherries, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Bildad!"
explained Bunch<br>
Bingham, edging away nervously. "We won't steal any, honest, sir.
Well pay<br>
you for them the very next time you come to the campus with milk
and eggs."</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho!" roared old Bildad, piratically, his colossal body
shaking, "A<br>
likely tale, lads&mdash;an' when I come for my money, ye'll jeer
me off the<br>
campus, an' tell me to whistle for it! Off my
land&mdash;<i>git,</i> an' don't let me<br>
cotch ye on it inside o' two minutes, or I'll let Caesar Napoleon
make a<br>
meal off'n yer bones&mdash;<i>git</i>!"</p>

<p>To express it briefly, they got. T, Haviland Hicks, Jr., not
standing on<br>
the order of his going, set off at a sprint that, while it might
have<br>
caused Ted Meredith to lose sleep, also aroused in Caesar
Napoleon an<br>
overwhelming desire to take out after the fugitive youth, so that
Mr.<br>
Bildad was forced to exert his vast strength to hold the massive
bulldog.<br>
Butch, Beef, Hefty, Tug, Buster, Bunch, Pudge, and Biff, a
pachydermic<br>
crew, awed by Caesar Napoleon's bloodthirsty actions, jogged off
in the<br>
wake of Hicks, who confidently expected to hear the bulldog
giving tongue,<br>
on his trail, at every second.</p>

<p>Another lane, making in from a road making a cross-roads with
the one<br>
from which they came to Bildad's house, ran alongside the orchard
for two<br>
hundred yards, inside the fence; at its end was a high roadgate.
At<br>
what they decided was a safe distance from the "war zone,"
the<br>
Heavy-Weight-White-Hope-Brigade, and T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., the
latter<br>
forcibly restrained from widening the margin between him and
peril, held a<br>
council on preparedness.</p>

<p>"The old pirate!" stormed Butch Brewster, gazing back to where
the vast<br>
figure of old Bildad, striding toward the house, towered. "We
can't let him<br>
get away with that, fellows. I'll have some of his cherries now,
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;<i>don't</i>, Butch!" chattered Hicks, whose
dread of dogs amounted to<br>
an obsession. "He can still see us, and if you leave the lane, he
will send<br>
Caesar Napoleon after us! Oh, <i>don't</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Butch Brewster, evidently wrathful at being balked, strode
from the<br>
path, or lane, of virtue, toward a cherry-tree, whose red fruit
hung<br>
temptingly low, and his example was followed by every one of the
Brigade,<br>
leaving the terrified Hicks to wait in the lane, where, because
of his<br>
alarm, he had no time to wonder at the bravado of his behemoth
comrades.<br>
However, finding that Bildad had disappeared, and believing he
had taken<br>
Caesar Napoleon into the house, the sunny Hicks, who was far from
a coward<br>
otherwise, but who had an unreasonable dread of dogs, little or
big, was<br>
about to wax courageous, and join his team-mates, when a wild
shout burst<br>
from Pudge Langdon:</p>

<p>"Run, fellows&mdash;<i>run</i>! Bildad's put the bulldog on
us! Here comes&mdash;Caesar<br>
Napoleon&mdash;!"</p>

<p>With a blood-chilling "Woof! Woof!" steadily sounding louder,
nearer,<br>
a streak of color shot across the orchard, from the house, toward
the<br>
affrighted Brigade, while old Bildad's hoarse growl shattered the
echoes<br>
with "Take 'em out o' here, Nap&mdash;chaw 'em up, boy!" For a
startled second,<br>
the youths stared at the on-rushing body, shooting toward them
through the<br>
orchard-grass at terrific speed, and then:</p>

<p>"Run!" howled T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., terror providing him
with wings, as<br>
per proverb. Down the lane, at a pace that would have done credit
to Barney<br>
Oldfield in his Blitzen Benz, the mosquito-like youth sprinted
madly, and<br>
ever, closer, closer on his trail, sounded that awful "Woof!
Woof!" from<br>
Caesar Napoleon, who, as Hicks well knew, was acting with full
authority<br>
from Bildad! He heard, as he fled frantically, the excited shouts
of his<br>
comrades.</p>

<p>"Beat it, Hicks&mdash;he's right after you&mdash;run!
Run!"</p>

<p>"Jump the fence&mdash;he can't get you then&mdash;jump!"</p>

<p>"He's right on your trail, Hicks&mdash;<i>sprint</i>, old
man!"</p>

<p>"Make the fence, old man&mdash;<i>jump</i> it&mdash;and you're
<i>safe</i>!"</p>

<p>The terrible truth dawned on the frightened youth, as he
desperately<br>
sprinted: the innocent bystander always gets hurt. He had
protested against<br>
the theft of Bildad's cherries, and naturally, the bulldog had
kept after<br>
<i>him</i>! But it was too late to stop, for the old adage was
extremely<br>
appropriate, "He who hesitates is lost." He must <i>make</i> that
road-gate, and<br>
tumble over it, in some fashion, or be torn to shreds by Caesar
Napoleon,<br>
the savage dog that the cruel Bildad had sent after the
youths.</p>

<p>Nearer loomed the road-gate, appallingly high. Closer sounded
the panting<br>
breath of the ferocious Caesar Napoleon, and his incessant
"Woof-woof!"<br>
became louder. It seemed to the desperate Hicks that the bulldog
was at his<br>
heels, and every instant he expected to feel those sharp teeth
take hold of<br>
his anatomy! Once, the despairing youth imitated Lot's wife and
turned his<br>
head. He saw a body streaking after him, gaining at every jump,
also he<br>
lost speed; so thereafter, he conscientiously devoted his every
energy to<br>
the task in hand, that of making the gate, and getting over it,
before<br>
Caesar Napoleon caught his quarry!</p>

<p>At last, the road-gate, at least ten feet high, to Hicks'
fevered<br>
imagination, came so close that a quick decision was necessary,
for Caesar<br>
Napoleon, also, was in the same zone, and in a few seconds he
would<br>
overhaul the fugitive. T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., realizing that a
second<br>
lost, perhaps, might prove fatal to his peace of mind,
desperately resolved<br>
to dash at the gate, and jump; if he succeeded even in striking
somewhere<br>
near the top, and falling over, he would not care, for the
bulldog would<br>
not follow him off Bildad's land. From his comrades, far in the
rear, came<br>
the chorus:</p>

<p>"Jump, Hicks! He's right on your heels!"</p>

<p>Like the immortal Light Brigade, Hicks had no time to reason
about<br>
anything. His but to jump or be bitten summed up the situation.
So, with<br>
a last desperate sprint, a quick dash, he left the
ground&mdash;luckily, the<br>
earth was hard, giving him a solid take-off, and he got a
splendid spring.<br>
As he arose In air, al! the training and practicing for form
stayed with<br>
him, and instinctively he turned, writhed, and kicked&mdash;</p>

<p>For a fleeting second, he saw the top of the gate beneath his
body, and<br>
he felt a thrill as he beheld twisted strands of barbed wire,
cruel and<br>
jagged, across it; then, with a great sensation of joy, he knew
that he<br>
had cleared the top, and a second later, he landed on the ground,
in the<br>
country road, in a heap.</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., that sunny-souled, happy-go-lucky,
indolent youth,<br>
for once in his care-free campus career aroused to strenuous
action,<br>
scrambled wildly to his feet, and forcibly realized the truth
of<br>
Longfellow's, "And things are not-what they seem!" Instead of
the<br>
ferocious, bloodthirsty bulldog, Caesar Napoleon, a huge,
half-grown<br>
St. Bernard pup gamboled inside the gate, frisking about
gleefully, and<br>
exhibiting, even so that Hicks, with all his innate dread of
dogs, could<br>
understand it, a vast friendliness. In fact, he seemed trying to
say,<br>
"That's fun. Come on and play with me some more!"</p>

<p>"Hey, fellows," shrieked the relieved Hicks, "that ain't
Caesar Napoleon!<br>
Why, he just wanted to play."</p>

<p>Bewildered, the members of the Heavy-Weight-White-Hope-Brigade
of the<br>
Bannister College track squad rushed on the scene. To their
surprise, they<br>
found not a savage bulldog, but a clumsy, good-natured St.
Bernard puppy,<br>
who frisked wildly about them, groveled at their feet, and put
his huge<br>
paws on them, with the playfulness of a juvenile elephant.</p>

<p>"Why, it <i>isn't</i> Nappie, for a fact!" gasped Butch. "Oh,
I am so glad<br>
that old Bildad wasn't mean enough to put the bulldog after us,
for he is<br>
dangerous. He scared us, though, and put this pup on our trail.
He wanted<br>
to play, and he thought it all a game, when Hicks fled. Oho! What
a joke on<br>
Hicks."</p>

<p>"I don't care!" grinned Hicks, thus siding with the famous Eva
Tanguay.<br>
"You fellows were fooled, too! You were too <i>scared</i> to run,
and if it had<br>
been Caesar Napoleon, I'd have saved your worthless lives by
getting him<br>
after me! I'll bet Bildad is snickering now, the old reprobate!
Why, Tug,<br>
are you <i>crazy</i>?"</p>

<p>Tug Cardiff, indeed, gave indications of lunacy. He marched up
to the<br>
road-gate, and stood close to it, so that the barbed wire top was
even with<br>
his hair; then he backed off, and gazed first at the gate, then
at the<br>
bewildered Hicks, while he grinned at the dazed squad in a
Cheshire cat<br>
style.</p>

<p>"Measure it, someone!" he shouted. "I am nearly six feet tall,
and it comes<br>
even with the top of my dome! Can't you see, you brainless
imbeciles, Hicks<br>
cleared it."</p>

<p>"Wait for me here!" howled big Butch Brewster, climbing the
fence and<br>
starting down the road at a pace that did credit even to that
fast<br>
two-miler. The Brigade, In the absence of their leader, tried to
estimate<br>
the height of the gate, and Hicks, gazing at its barbed-wire
top,<br>
shuddered. The St. Bernard pup, having caused T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr., for<br>
once in his indolent life to exert every possible ounce of energy
in his<br>
splinter-frame, groveled at his feet, and strove to express his
boundless<br>
joy at their presence.</p>

<p>Butch Brewster, in fifteen minutes, returned, panting and
perspiring,<br>
bearing a tape-measure, borrowed at the next farm-house. With all
the<br>
solemnity of a sacred rite being performed, the youths waited, as
Butch and<br>
Tug, holding the tape taut, carefully measured from the ground to
the top<br>
of the barbed wire on the gate. Three times they did this, and
then, with<br>
an expression of gladness on his honest countenance, Butch hugged
the<br>
dazed T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., while Tug Cardiff howled, "Now for
the<br>
Intercollegiates and your track B, Hicks! You <i>can</i> do
five-ten in the<br>
meet, for Coach Brannigan said you could dear it, if only you did
it<br>
<i>once</i>."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what do you mean, Tug?" quavered Hicks, not daring
to allow himself<br>
to believe the truth. "You&mdash;you surely don't
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean, that now you <i>know</i> you can jump that high,"
boomed Tug, executing<br>
a weird dance of exultation, In which, the Brigade joined, until
it<br>
resembled a herd of elephants gone insane, "for you have done
it&mdash;allowing<br>
for the sag, and everything, that gate is just five feet, ten
inches high,<br>
and&mdash;<i>you cleared it</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;Hicks, of Bannister, is about to
high jump! Hicks<br>
and McQuade, of Hamilton, are tied for first place at five feet
eight<br>
inches! McQuade has failed three times at five-ten! Hicks' third
and last<br>
trial! Height of bar&mdash;five feet ten inches!"</p>

<p>This time, however, it was not big Tug Cardiff, imitating a
Ballyhoo<br>
Bill, and inciting the Bannister youths to hilarity at the
expense of the<br>
sunny-souled T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.; it was the Official
Announcer at the<br>
Annual State Intercollegiate Field and Track Championships, on
Bannister<br>
Field, and his announcement aroused a tumult of excitement in the
Bannister<br>
section of the stands, as well as among the Gold and Green
cinder-path<br>
stars.</p>

<p>"Come on, Hicks, old man!" urged Butch Brewster, who, with a
dozen fully<br>
as excited comrades of the cheery Hicks, surrounded that
splinter-athlete.<br>
"It's positively your last chance to win your track B, or your
letter in<br>
any sport, and please your Dad! If they lower the bar, and you
two jump off<br>
the tie, McQuade's endurance will bring him out the winner."</p>

<p>"You <i>can</i> clear five-ten!" encouraged Bunch Bingham.
"You did it once,<br>
when you believed Caesar Napoleon was after you. Just summon up
that much<br>
energy now, and clear that bar! Once over, the event and your
letter are<br>
won! Oh, if we only had that bulldog here, to sick on you."</p>

<p>Sad to chronicle, the score-board of the Intercollegiates
recorded the<br>
results of the events, so far, thus:</p>

<p>    HAMILTON ............35 BALLARD .............20 BANNISTER
...........28</p>

<p>It was the last event, and even did Hicks win the high-jump,
McQuade's<br>
second place would easily give old Ham. the Championship. Hence,
knowing<br>
that victory was not booked for an appearance on the Gold and
Green<br>
banners, the Bannister youths, wild for the lovable, popular
Hicks to win<br>
his Bs vociferously pulled for him:</p>

<p>"Come on, Hicks&mdash;up and over, old man&mdash;it's
<i>easy</i>!"</p>

<p>"Jump, you Human Grass-Hopper&mdash;you can do it!"</p>

<p>"Now or never, Hicks! One big jump does the work!"</p>

<p>"Sick Caesar Napoleon on him, Coach; he'll clear it then!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., casting aside that flamboyant
bathrobe, for what he<br>
believed was the last athletic event of his campus career, stood
gazing at<br>
the cross-bar. One superhuman effort, a great explosion of all
his energy,<br>
such as he had executed when he cleared the gate, thinking Caesar
Napoleon<br>
was after him, and the event was won! He <i>had</i> cleared that
height, it was<br>
within his power. If he failed, as Butch said, the bar would be
lowered,<br>
and then raised until one or the other missed once. McQuade, with
his<br>
superior strength and endurance, must inevitably win, but as he
had just<br>
missed on his third trial at five-ten, if Hicks cleared that
height on<br>
<i>his</i> final chance, the first place was his.</p>

<p>"And my B!" murmured Hicks, tensing his muscles. "Oh, won't my
Dad be<br>
happy? It will help him to realize some of his ambition, when I
show him my<br>
track letter! It is positively my last chance, and I <i>must</i>
clear it."</p>

<p>With a vast wave of determined confidence inundating his very
being, Hicks<br>
started for the bar; after those first, peculiar, creeping steps,
he had<br>
just started his gallop, when he heard Tug Cardiff's
<i>basso</i>, magnified by<br>
a megaphone, roared:</p>

<p>"All together, fellows&mdash;<i>let 'er go</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, just as Hicks dug his spikes into the earth, in that
short, mad<br>
sprint that gives the jumper his spring, just as he reached the
take-off,<br>
a perfect explosion of noise startled him, and he caught a sound
that<br>
frightened him, tensed as he was:</p>

<p>"Woof! Woof! Bow! Wow! Woof! Woof! Woof! Look out, Hicks,
Caesar Napoleon<br>
is after you!"</p>

<p>Psychology Is inexplicable. Ever afterward, Hicks' comrades of
that<br>
cross-country run averred strenuously that their roaring
through<br>
megaphones, in concert, imitating Caesar Napoleon's savage bark
at the<br>
psychological moment, flung the mosquito-like youth clear of the
cross-bar<br>
and won him the event and his B. Hicks, however, as fervidly
denied this<br>
statement, declaring that he would have won, anyhow, because he
had<br>
summoned up the determination to do it! So it can not be stated
just what<br>
bearing on his jump the plot of Butch Brewster really had. In
truth, that<br>
behemoth had entertained a wild idea of actually hiring old
Bildad and<br>
Caesar Napoleon to appear at the moment Hicks started for his
last trial,<br>
but this weird scheme was abandoned!</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, when T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., had
escaped from the<br>
riotous Bannister students, delirious with joy at the victory of
the<br>
beloved youth, the Heavy-Weight-White-Hope Brigade, capturing
the<br>
grass-hopper Senior, gave him a shock second only to that which
he had<br>
experienced when first he believed Caesar Napoleon was on his
trail.</p>

<p>"Perhaps our barking didn't make you jump it!" said Beef
McNaughton, when<br>
Hicks indignantly denied that he had been scared over the
cross-bar, "but<br>
indirectly, old man, we helped you to win! If we had not put up a
hoax on<br>
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A <i>hoax</i>?" queried the surprised Hicks. "What do you
mean&mdash;hoax?"</p>

<p>"It was all a frame-up!" grinned Butch Brewster, triumphantly.
"We paid old<br>
Bildad five dollars to play his part, and as an actor, he has
Booth and<br>
Barrymore backed off the stage! We got Coach Brannigan to send
you along<br>
with us on the cross-country jog, and your absurd dread of dogs,
Hicks,<br>
made it easy! Bildad, per instructions, produced Caesar Napoleon,
and<br>
scared you. Then, with a telescope, he watched us, and when I
gave the<br>
signal, he let loose Bob, the harmless St. Bernard pup, on our
trail.</p>

<p>"The pup, as he always does, chased after strangers, ready to
play. We<br>
yelled for you to run, and you were so <i>scared</i>, you insect,
you didn't<br>
wait to see the dog. Even when you looked back, in your alarm,
you didn't<br>
know it was not Caesar Napoleon, for his grim visage was seared
on your<br>
brain&mdash;I mean, where your brain ought to be! And even had
you seen it<br>
wasn't the bulldog, you would have been frightened, all the same.
But I<br>
confess, Hicks, when you sailed over that high gate, it was one
on <i>us</i>."</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., drew a deep breath, and then a
Cheshire cat grin<br>
came to his cherubic countenance. So, after all, it had been a
hoax; there<br>
had not been any peril. No wonder these behemoths had so
courageously taken<br>
the cherries! But, beyond a doubt, the joke <i>had</i> helped him
to win his<br>
B. It had shown him he could clear five feet, ten inches, for he
had done<br>
it&mdash;and, in the meet, when the crucial moment came, the
knowledge that he<br>
<i>had</i> jumped that high, and, therefore, could do it,
helped&mdash;where the<br>
thought that he never had cleared it would have dragged him down.
He had at<br>
last won his B, a part of his beloved Dad's great ambition was
realized,<br>
and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, just leave it to Hicks!" quoth that sunny-souled,
irrepressible<br>
youth, swaggering a trifle, "It was my mighty will-power, my
terrific<br>
determination, that took me over the cross-bar, and
not&mdash;<i>not</i> your<br>
imitation of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Woof! Woof! Woof!" roared the
"Heavy-Weight-White-Hope-Brigade" in<br>
thunderous chorus. "Sick him&mdash;Caesar Napoleon&mdash;!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XVII</p>

<p>HICKS MAKES A RASH PROPHECY</p>

<p>"Come on, Butch! Atta boy&mdash;some fin, old top! Say, you
Beef&mdash;you're asleep<br>
at the switch. What time do you want to be called? More pep
there,<br>
Monty&mdash;bust that little old bulb, Roddy! Aw, rotten! Say,
Ballard, your<br>
playing will bring the Board of Health down on you&mdash;why
don't you bring<br>
your first team out? Umpire? What&mdash;do you call that an
umpire? Why, he's<br>
a highway robber, a bandit. Put a 'Please Help the Blind' sign on
that<br>
hold-up artist!"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, captain of the Bannister College baseball
squad,<br>
navigating down the third-floor corridor of Bannister Hall, the
Senior<br>
dormitory, laden with suitcases, bat-bags, and other impedimenta,
as Mr.<br>
Julius Caesar says, and vastly resembling a bell-hop in action,
paused in<br>
sheer bewilderment on the threshold of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s,
cozy room.</p>

<p>"Hicks!" stormed the bewildered Butch, wrathfully, "what in
the name of Sam<br>
Hill <i>are</i> you doing? Are you crazy, you absolutely insane
lunatic? This<br>
is a study-hour, and even if <i>you</i> don't possess an
intellect, some of the<br>
fellows want to exercise their brains an hour or so! Stop that
ridiculous<br>
action."</p>

<p>The spectacle Butch Brewster beheld was indeed one to paralyze
that<br>
pachydermic collegian, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., the
sunny-souled,<br>
irrepressible Senior, danced madly about on the tiger-skin rug in
midfloor,<br>
evidently laboring under the delusion that he was a lunatical
Hottentot at<br>
a tribal dance; he waved his arms wildly, like a signaling
brakeman, or<br>
howled through a big megaphone, and about his toothpick structure
was<br>
strung his beloved banjo, on which the blithesome youth twanged
at times an<br>
accompaniment to his jargon:</p>

<p>"Come on, Skeet, take a lead (<i>plunkety-plunk</i>!) Say,
d'ye wanta marry<br>
first base&mdash;divorce yourself from that sack!
(<i>plunk-plunk</i>!) Oh, you<br>
bonehead&mdash;steal&mdash;you won't get arrested for it! Hi! Yi!
Ouch, Butch! Oh,<br>
I'll be good&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment, the indignant Butch abruptly terminated T.
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr.'s, noisy monologue by seizing that splinter-youth firmly by
the scruff<br>
of the neck and forcibly hurling him on the davenport. Seeing his
loyal<br>
class-mate's resemblance to a Grand Central Station
baggage-smasher, the<br>
irrepressible Senior forthwith imitated a hotel-clerk:</p>

<p>"Front!" howled the grinning Hicks, to an imaginary bellboy,
"Show this<br>
gentleman to Number 2323! Are you alone, sir, or just by
yourself? I think<br>
you will like the room-it faces on the coal-chute, and has hot
and cold<br>
folding-doors, and running water when the roof leaks! The bed is
made once<br>
a week, regularly, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hicks, you Infinitesimal Atom of Nothing!" growled big Butch,
ominously.<br>
"What were you doing, creating all that riot, as I came down the
corridor?<br>
What's the main idea, anyway, of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heed, friend of my campus days," chortled the graceless
Hicks, keeping<br>
a safe distance from his behemoth comrade, "tomorrow-your
baseball<br>
aggregation plays Ballard College, at that knowledge-factory, for
the<br>
Championship of the State. Because nature hath endowed me with
the<br>
Herculean structure of a Jersey mosquito, I am developing a
56-lung-power<br>
voice, and I need practice, as I am to be the only student-rooter
at the<br>
game tomorrow! Q.E.D.! And as for any Bannister student, except
perhaps<br>
Theophilus Opperdyke and Thor, desiring to investigate the
interiors of<br>
their lexicons tonight, I prithee, just periscope the
campus."</p>

<p>"I guess you are right, Hicks!" grinned Butch Brewster, as he
looked from<br>
the window, down on an indescribably noisy scene. "For once, your
riotous<br>
tumult went unheard. Say, get your traveling-bag ready, and leave
that<br>
pestersome banjo behind, if you want to go with the nine!"</p>

<p>Several members of the Gold and Green nine, embryo American
and National<br>
League stars, roosted on the Senior Fence between the Gymnasium
and the<br>
Administration Building, with, suitcases and bat-bags on the
grass. In a<br>
few minutes old Dan Flannagan's celebrated jitney-bus would
appear in the<br>
offing, coming to transport the Bannister athletes downtown to
the station,<br>
for the 9 P.M. express to Philadelphia. Incited by Cheer-Leaders
Skeezicks<br>
McCracken and Snake Fisher, several hundred youths encouraged the
nine,<br>
since, because of approaching final exams., they were barred by
Faculty<br>
order from accompanying the team to Ballard. In thunderous chorus
they<br>
chanted:</p>

<p>  "One more Job for the undertaker!<br>
  More work for the tombstone maker!<br>
  la the local ceme<i>tery</i>, they are
very&mdash;very&mdash;<i>very</i><br>
  Busy on a brand-new grave for&mdash;Ballard!"</p>

<p>As the lovable Hicks expressed it, "'Coming events cast their
shadows<br>
before.' Commencement overshadows our joyous campus existence!"
However, no<br>
Bannister acquaintance of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., could detect
wherein the<br>
swiftly approaching final separation from his Alma Mater had
affected in<br>
the least that happy-go-lucky, care-free, irrepressible youth. If
anything,<br>
it seemed that Hicks strove to fight off thoughts of the end of
his golden<br>
campus years, using as weapons his torturesome saengerfests, his
Beefsteak<br>
Busts down at Jerry's, and various other pastimes, to the vast
indignation<br>
of his good friend and class-mate, Butch Brewster, who tried
futilely to<br>
lecture him into the proper serious mood with which Seniors must
sail<br>
through Commencement!</p>

<p>"You are a Senior, Hicks, a Senior!" Butch would explain
wrathfully. "You<br>
are popularly supposed to be dignified, and here you persist in
acting like<br>
a comedian in a vaudeville show! I suppose you intend to appear
on the<br>
stage, and, when handed your sheepskin, respond by twanging your
banjo and<br>
roaring a silly ballad."</p>

<p>Yet, the cheery Hicks had been very busy, since that memorable
day when,<br>
thanks to Caesar Napoleon and the hoax of the
Heavy-Weight-White-Hope-<br>
Brigade of the track squad, he had cleared the cross-bar at
five-ten,<br>
and won the event and his white B! Mr. T. Haviland Hicks, Sr.,
overjoyed<br>
at his son's achievement, had sent him a generous check, which
the youth<br>
much needed, and had promised to be present at the annual
Athletic<br>
Association Meeting, at Commencement, when the B's were
awarded<br>
deserving athletes, which caused Hicks as much joy as the pink
slip.<br>
With his final study sprint for the Senior Finals, his duties as
team-<br>
manager of the baseball nine, his preparations for Commencement,
his<br>
social duties at the Junior Prom., and multifarious other
details<br>
coincident to graduation, the heedless Hicks had not found time
to be<br>
sorrowful at the knowledge that it soon would end, forever, that
he must<br>
say "Farewell, Alma Mater," and leave the campus and corridors of
old<br>
Bannister; yet soon even Hicks' ebullient spirits must fail,
for<br>
Commencement was a trifle over a week off.</p>

<p>"Hicks, you lovable, heedless, irrepressible wretch," said Big
Butch,<br>
affectionately, as the two class-mates thrilled at the scene.
"Does it<br>
penetrate that shrapnel-proof concrete dome of yours that the
Ballard game<br>
tomorrow is the final athletic contest of my, and likewise your,
campus<br>
career at old Bannister?"</p>

<p>"Similar thoughts has smote my colossal intellect, Butch!"
responded the<br>
bean-pole Hicks, gladsomely. "But&mdash;why seek to overshadow
this joyous scene<br>
with somber reflections? You-should-worry. You have annexed
sufficient B's,<br>
were they different, to make up an alphabet. You've won your
letter on<br>
gridiron, track, and baseball field, and you've been team-captain
of<br>
everything twice! Why, therefore, sheddest thou them crocodile
tears?"</p>

<p>"Not for myself, thou sunny-souled idler!" announced Butch,
generously,<br>
"But for <i>thee</i>! I prithee, since you pritheed me a few
moments hence, let<br>
that so-called colossal intellect of yours stride back along the
corridors<br>
of Time, until it reaches a certain day toward the close of our
Freshman<br>
year. Remember, you had made a hilarious failure of every
athletic event<br>
you tried-football, basketball, track, and baseball; you had just
made a<br>
tremendous farce of the Freshman-Sophomore track meet, and to me,
your<br>
loyal comrade, you uttered these rash words, 'Before I graduate
from old<br>
Bannister, I shall have won my B in three branches of sport!'</p>

<p>"I reiterate and repeat, tomorrow's game with Ballard is the
last chance<br>
you will have. There is no possibility that you, with your
well-known lack<br>
of baseball ability, will get in the game, and&mdash;your track
B, won in the<br>
high-jump, is the only B you have won! Now, do you still maintain
that you<br>
will make good that rash vow?"</p>

<p>"'Where there's a will, there's a way.' 'Never say die.'
'While there's<br>
life, there's hope.' 'Don't give up the ship.' 'Fight to the last
ditch.'<br>
'In the bright lexicon of youth there is no such word as
<i>fail</i>,'"<br>
quoth the irrepressible Hicks, all in a breath. "As long as there
is an<br>
infinitesimal fraction of a chance left, I repeat, just leave it
to Hicks!"</p>

<p>"You haven't got a chance in the world!" Butch assured him,
consolingly.<br>
"You did manage to get into one football game, for a minute, and
you were a<br>
'Varsity player that long. By sticking to it, you have won your
track B in<br>
the high-jump, thanks to your grass-hopper build, and we rejoice
at your<br>
reward! Your Dad is happy that you've won a B, so why not be
sensible, and<br>
cease this ridiculous talk of winning your B in <i>three</i>
sports, when you<br>
can see it is preposterously out of the question, absolutely
impossible&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was not that Butch. Brewster did not <i>want</i> his sunny
classmate to win<br>
his B in three sports, or that he would have failed to rejoice at
Hicks'<br>
winning the triple honor. Had such a thing seemed within the
bounds of<br>
possibility, Butch, big-hearted and loyal, would have been as
happy as<br>
Hicks, or his Dad. But what the behemoth athlete became wrathful
at was the<br>
obviously lunatical way in which the cheery Hicks, now that his
college<br>
years were almost ended, parrot-like repeated, "Oh, just leave it
to<br>
Hicks!" when he must know all hope was dead. In truth, T,
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., in pretending to maintain still that he would make good the
rash<br>
vow of his Freshman year, had no purpose but to arouse his
comrade's<br>
indignation; but Butch, serious of nature, believed there really
lurked in<br>
Hicks' system some germs of hope.</p>

<p>"We never know, old top!" chuckled Hicks, though he was
<i>sure</i> he could<br>
never fulfill that promise, as he had not played three-fourths of
a season<br>
on both the football and the baseball teams, "Something may show
up at the<br>
last minute, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment, something evidently did show up, on the campus
below, for<br>
the enthusiastic students howled in: thunderous chorus, as the
"Honk!<br>
Honk!" of a Claxon was heard, "Here he comes! All together,
fellows&mdash;the<br>
Bannister yell for the nine&mdash;then for good old Dan
Flannagan!"</p>

<p>As Hicks and Butch watched from the window, old Dan
Flannagan's jitney-bus,<br>
to the discordant blaring of a horn, progressed up the driveway,
even as it<br>
had done on that night in September, when it transported to the
campus<br>
T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., and Thor, the Prodigious Prodigy. Amid
salvos of<br>
applause from the Bannister youths, and blasts of the Claxon, old
Dan<br>
brought "The Dove" to a stop before the Senior Fence, and bowed
to the<br>
nine, grinning genially the while.</p>

<p>"The car waits at the door, sir!" spoke T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr., touching<br>
his cap after the fashion of an English butler, before seizing a
bat-bag,<br>
and his suit-case. "As team manager, I must attempt to force into
Skeet<br>
Wigglesworth's dome how he and the five subs, are to travel on
the C. N. &amp;<br>
Q., to Eastminster, from Baltimore. Come on, Butch, we're
off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are always off!" commented Butch, good-humoredly, as he
seized his<br>
baggage and followed the mosquito-like Hicks from the room,
downstairs, and<br>
out on the campus. Here the assembled youths, with yells, cheers,
and songs<br>
sandwiched between humorous remarks to Dan Flannagan, watched the
thrilling<br>
spectacle of the Gold and Green nine, with the Team Manager and
five<br>
substitutes, fifteen in all, squeeze into and atop of Dan
Flannagan's<br>
jitney-Ford.</p>

<p>"Let me check you fellows off," said Hicks, importantly,
peering into the<br>
jitney, for he, as Team Manager, had to handle the traveling
expenses.<br>
"Monty Merriweather, Roddy Perkins, Biff Pemberton. Butch
Brewster, Skeet<br>
Wigglesworth, Beef McNaughton, Cherub Challoner, Ichabod Crane,
Don<br>
Carterson; that is the regular nine, and are you five subs,
present? O. K.<br>
Skeet, climb out here a second."</p>

<p>Little Skeet Wigglesworth, the brilliant short-stop, climbed
out with<br>
exceeding difficulty, and facing T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., he
saluted in<br>
military fashion. The team manager, consulting a timetable of the
C. N.<br>
&amp;.Q. railroad, fixed him with a stern look.</p>

<p>"Skeet," he spoke distinctly, "now, <i>get
this</i>&mdash;myself and eight regulars,<br>
<i>nine</i> in all, will take the 9 P. M. express for
Philadelphia, and stay<br>
there all night. Tomorrow, at 8 A. M., we leave Broad Street
Station for<br>
Eastminster, arriving at 11 A. M. Now I have a lot of unused
mileage on<br>
the C. N. &amp; Q., and I want to use it up before Commencement.
So, heed: you<br>
want to go <i>via</i> Baltimore, to see your parents. You take
the 9.20 P. M.<br>
express tonight, to Baltimore, and go from that city in the
morning, to<br>
Eastminster, on the C. N, &amp; Q.&mdash;it's the only road. And
take the five subs<br>
with you, to devour the mileage. Now, has that penetrated thy
bomb-proof<br>
dome?"</p>

<p>"Sure; you don't have to deliver a Chautauqua lecture, Hicks!"
grinned<br>
Skeet. "Say, what time does my train leave Baltimore, in the
A.M., for<br>
Eastminster?"</p>

<p>"Let's see." T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., handing the mileage-books
to the<br>
shortstop, focused his intellect on the C. N. &amp; Q. timetable.
"Oh, yes&mdash;you<br>
leave Union Station, Baltimore, at 7:30 A.M., arriving at
Eastminster at<br>
noon; <i>it is the only train, you can get,</i> to make it in
time for the game,<br>
so remember the hour&mdash;7.30 A.M.! Here, stuff the timetable
in your pocket."</p>

<p>In a few moments, the team and substitutes had been jammed
into old Dan<br>
Flannagan's jitney, and the Bannister youths on the campus
concentrated<br>
their interest on the sunny Hicks, who, grinning &agrave; la
Cheshire cat,<br>
climbed atop of "The Dove," which old Dan was having as much
trouble to<br>
start as he had experienced for over twenty years with the late
Lord<br>
Nelson, his defunct quadruped. Seeing Hicks abstract a
Louisville<br>
Slugger from the bat-bag, the students roared facetious remarks
at the<br>
irrepressible youth:</p>

<p>"Home-run Hicks&mdash;he made a home-run&mdash;<i>on a
strike-out</i>!"&mdash;"Put Hicks in<br>
the game, Captain Butch&mdash;he will win it."&mdash;"Watch
Hicks&mdash;he'll pull<br>
some <i>bonehead</i> play!"&mdash;"Bring home the Championship,
but&mdash;lose Hicks<br>
somewhere!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., as the battered engine of the jit.
yielded to<br>
old Dan's cranking, and kindly consented to start, surveyed the
yelling<br>
students, seized a bat, and struck an attitude which he fatuously
believed<br>
was that of Ty Cobb, about to make a hit; taking advantage of a
lull in the<br>
tumult, the lovable youth howled at the hilarious crowd:</p>

<p>"Just leave it to Hicks! I will win the game and the
Championship, for my<br>
Alma Mater, and&mdash;I'll do it by my headwork!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XVIII</p>

<p>T. HAVILAND HICKS, JR'S. HEADWORK</p>

<p>"Play Ball! Say, Bannister, are you <i>afraid</i> to
play?"</p>

<p>"Call the game, Mr. Ump.&mdash;make 'em play ball!"</p>

<p>"Batter up! Forfeit the game to Ballard, Umpire!"</p>

<p>"Lend 'em Ballard's bat-boy-to make a full nine!"</p>

<p>Captain Butch Brewster, his honest countenance, as a
moving-picture<br>
director would express it, "registering wrathful dismay,"
lumbered toward<br>
the Ballard Field concrete dug-out, in which the Gold and Green
players<br>
had entrenched themselves, while from the stands, the Ballard
cohorts<br>
vociferated their intense impatience at the inexplicable
delay.</p>

<p>"We have <i>got</i> to play," he raged, striding up and down
before the bench.<br>
"The game is ten minutes late now, and the crowd is restless! And
here we<br>
have only <i>eight</i> 'Varsity players, and no one to make the
ninth&mdash;not even<br>
a sub.! Oh, I could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That brainless Skeet Wigglesworth!" ejaculated T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
who, arrayed like a lily of the field, reposed his
splinter-structure on<br>
the bench with his comrades. "In some way, he managed to
<i>miss</i> that train<br>
from Baltimore! They didn't come on the noon C, N. &amp; Q.
train, and there<br>
isn't another one until night. My directions were as plain as a
German<br>
war-map, and it beats me how Skeet got befuddled!"</p>

<p>Gloom, as thick and abysmal as a London fog, hovered over the
Bannister<br>
dug-out. On the concrete bench, the seven Gold and Green
athletes, Beef,<br>
Monty, Roddy, Biff, Ichabod, Don, and Cherub, with Team Manager
T. Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., stared silently at Captain Butch Brewster, who seemed
in<br>
imminent peril of exploding. Something probably never before
heard of in<br>
the annals of athletic history had happened. Bannister College,
about to<br>
play Ballard the big game for the State Championship, had lost a
short-stop<br>
and five substitutes, in some unfathomable manner, and it was
impossible<br>
to round up one other member of the Gold and Green baseball
squad. True, a<br>
hundred loyal alumni were in the stands, but only <i>bona
fide</i> students, of<br>
course, were eligible to play the game, and&mdash;the Faculty
ruling had kept<br>
them at old Bannister!</p>

<p>"Here comes Ballard's Manager," spoke Beef McNaughton, as a
brisk,<br>
clean-cut youth advanced, a yellow envelope in hand. "Why, he has
a<br>
telegram. Do you suppose Skeet actually had <i>brains</i> enough
to wire an<br>
explanation?"</p>

<p>"Telegram for Captain Brewster!" announced the Ballard
collegian, giving<br>
the message to that surprised behemoth. "It was sent in my
care&mdash;collect,<br>
and the sender, name of Wigglesworth, fired one to me personally,
telling<br>
me to deliver this one to Captain Butch Brewster, and collect
from Team<br>
Manager Hicks&mdash;he surely didn't bother to save money! I've
been out of<br>
town, and just got back to the campus; of course, the telegrams
could not<br>
be delivered to anyone but me, hence the delay."</p>

<p>Big Butch, thanking the Ballard Team Manager, and assuring him
that the<br>
charges he had paid would be advanced to him after the game,
ripped open<br>
the yellow envelope, and drew out the message. Like a
thunder-storm<br>
gathering on the horizon, a dark expression came to good
Butch's<br>
countenance, and when he had perused the lengthy telegram, he
transfixed<br>
the startled and bewildered T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., with an angry
glare:</p>

<p>"Bonehead!" he raged, apparently controlling himself with a
superhuman<br>
effort. "Oh, you lunatic, you wretch,
villain&mdash;you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>To the supreme amazement and dismay of the puzzled Hicks,
Beef, next in<br>
line, after <i>he</i> had scanned Skeet's telegram, followed
Butch's example,<br>
for <i>he</i> glowered at the perturbed youth, and heaped
condemnations on his<br>
devoted head. And so on down the line on the bench, until Monty,
Roddy,<br>
Biff, Ichabod, Don, and Cherub, reading the message, joined in
gazing<br>
indignantly at their gladsome Team Manager, who, as the eight
arose <i>en<br>
masse</i> and advanced on him, sought to flee the wrath to
come.</p>

<p>"Safety first!" quoth T, Haviland Hicks, Jr. "'Mine not to
reason why, mine<br>
but to haste and fly,' or&mdash;be crushed! Ouch! Beef,
Monty&mdash;have a heart!"</p>

<p>Captured by Beef and Monty Merriweather, as he frantically
scrambled up<br>
the steps of the concrete dug-out, the grinning Hicks was held in
the firm<br>
grasp of that behemoth, Butch Brewster, aided by the skyscraper
Ichabod,<br>
while Cherub Challoner thrust the telegram before his eyes. In
words of<br>
fire that burned themselves into his brain&mdash;something his
colleagues<br>
denied he possessed&mdash;T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., saw the
explanation of Skeet<br>
Wigglesworth's missing the train from Baltimore that A. M. Dazed,
the sunny<br>
youth read the message on which over-charges must be paid:</p>

<p>"Hicks&mdash;you bonehead! The time-table of the C.N. &amp; Q.
you gave me was an<br>
old one&mdash;schedule revised two weeks ago! Train now leaves
Balto. at 6.55<br>
A.M.! When we got to station at 7.05 A.M. she had went! No train
to Ballard<br>
till night! I and subs, had to wire Bannister for money to get
back on!<br>
You mis-manager&mdash;the <i>head-work</i> you boasted of is
boneheadwork! Pay the<br>
charges on this, you brainless insect! I'll send it to Butch, for
you'd<br>
never show it to him if I sent it to you! Indignantly&mdash;</p>

<p>"SKEET."</p>

<p>"Mis-manager is <i>right</i>!" seethed Captain Butch, for once
in his campus<br>
career really wrathy at the lovable Hicks. "We are in a
fix&mdash;eight players,<br>
and the crowd howling for the game to start. Oh, I could jump
overboard,<br>
and drag you with me!"</p>

<p>"Bonehead! Bonehead!" chorused the Gold and Green players,
indignantly.<br>
"Gave Skeet an out-of-date time-table&mdash;never looked at the
date! Let's drag<br>
him out before the crowd, and announce to them his brilliant
headwork!"</p>

<p>Captain Butch, "up against it," to employ a slightly slang
expression,<br>
gazed across Ballard Field. In the stands, the students
responding<br>
thunderously to their cheer-leaders' megaphoned requests, roared,
"Play<br>
ball! Play ball! Play ball!" Gay pennants and banners fluttered
in the<br>
glorious sunshine of the June day. It was a bright scene, but its
glory<br>
awakened no happiness in the heart of the Bannister leader, as
his gaze<br>
wandered to the somewhat flabbergasted expression on the cheery
Hicks'<br>
face. That inevitably sunny youth, however, managed to conjure up
a faint<br>
resemblance of his Cheshire cat grin, and following his usual
habit of<br>
letting nothing daunt his gladsome spirit, he croaked feebly:
"Oh, just<br>
leave it to Hicks! I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Play the game!" thundered Butch, inspired. "Beef, see the
umpire and say<br>
we'll be ready as soon as we get Hicks into togs-show him the
telegram, and<br>
explain our delay! I'll shift Monty from the outfield to Skeet's
job at<br>
short, and put this diluted imitation of something human in the
field, to<br>
do his worst. Come to the field-house, you poor fish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Butch, I can't&mdash;I just <i>can't</i>!" protested the
alarmed Hicks,<br>
helpless, as the big athlete towed him from the trench,
"I&mdash;I can't play<br>
ball, and I don't want to be shown up before all that mob! It's
all right<br>
at Bannister, in class-games, but&mdash;Oh, can't you play the
game with <i>eight</i><br>
fellows?"</p>

<p>"That is just what we intend to do!" said Butch, with grim
humor.<br>
"But&mdash;we'll have a dummy in the ninth position, to make the
people believe<br>
we have a full nine! Cheer up, Hicks&mdash;'In the bright lexicon
of youth<br>
there ain't no such word as fail,' you say! As for your making a
fool of<br>
yourself, you haven't brains enough to be classed as one!
Now&mdash;you'll pay<br>
dearly for your bonehead play."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., as agitated as a
<i>prima donna</i><br>
making her d&eacute;but with the Metropolitan: Opera Company,
decorated the<br>
Bannister bench, arrayed in one of the substitutes' baseball
suits. It<br>
was too large for his splinter-structure, so that it flapped
grotesquely,<br>
giving him a startling resemblance to a scarecrow escaped from a
cornfield.<br>
With the thermometer of his spirits registering zero, the
dismayed youth,<br>
whose punishment was surely fitting the crime, heard the Umpire
bellow:</p>

<p>"Play ball! Batter up! Bannister at bat&mdash;Ballard in the
field!"</p>

<p>Hicks, that sunny-souled youth, had often daydreamed of
himself in a big<br>
game of baseball, for his college. He had vividly imagined a
ninth inning<br>
crisis, three of the enemy on base, two out, and a long fly, good
for a<br>
home-run, soaring over his head. How he had
sprinted&mdash;back&mdash;back&mdash;and at<br>
the last second, reached high in the air, grabbing the soaring
spheroid,<br>
and saving the game for his Alma Mater! Often, too, he had
stepped up to<br>
bat in the final frame, with two out, one on base, and Bannister
a run<br>
behind. With the vast crowd silent and breathless, he had
walloped the<br>
ball, over the left-field fence, and jogged around the bases,
thrilling to<br>
the thunderous cheers of his comrades. But now&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oooo!" shivered Hicks, as though he had just stepped beneath
an icy<br>
shower-bath. "I wish I could run away. I just <i>know</i> they'll
knock every<br>
ball to me, and I couldn't catch one with a sheriff and
posse!"</p>

<p>However, since, despite the blithesome Hicks' lack of
confidence, it was<br>
that sunny Senior, after all, whom fate&mdash;or fortune,
accordingly as<br>
each nine viewed it&mdash;destined to be the hero of the
Bannister-Ballard<br>
Championship baseball contest, the game itself is shoved into
such<br>
insignificance that it can be briefly chronicled by recording the
events<br>
that led up to T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, self-prophesied
"head-work."</p>

<p>Without Skeet Wigglesworth at shortstop, with the futile Hicks
in<br>
right-field, and the confidence of the nine shaken, Captain Butch
Brewster<br>
and the Gold and Green players went into the big game, unable to
shake off<br>
the feeling that they would be defeated. And when Pitcher Don
Carterson,<br>
in his half of the frame, passed the first two Ballard batters,
the belief<br>
deepened to conviction. However, a fast double play and a long
fly ended<br>
the inning without damage, and Bannister, likewise, had failed to
make an<br>
impression on the score-board. In the second, Don promptly showed
that he<br>
was striving to rival the late Cy Morgan, of the Athletics, for
he promptly<br>
hit two batters and passed the third, whereupon, as
sporting-writers<br>
express it, he was "derricked" by Captain Butch.</p>

<p>Placing the deposed twirler in left field, Captain Brewster,
as a last<br>
resort, believing the game hopelessly lost, with his star pitcher
having<br>
failed, and his relief slabmen, thanks to Hicks, mislaid <i>en
route</i>, sent<br>
out to the box one Ichabod Crane, brought in from the position
given to<br>
Don Carterson. This cadaverous, skyscraper Senior, who always
announced,<br>
himself as originating, "Back at Bedwell Center, Pa., where I
come from&mdash;"<br>
was well known to fame as the "Champion Horse-Shoe Pitcher of
Bucks<br>
County," but his baseball pitching was rather uncertain; like the
girl in<br>
the nursery jingle, Ichabod, as a twirler, "When he was good, he
was very,<br>
very good, and when he was wild, he was <i>horrid</i>!" Like
Christy Mathewson,<br>
after he had pitched a few balls, he knew whether or not he was
in<br>
shape for the game, and so did the spectators. With terrific
speed and<br>
bewildering curves, Ichabod would have made a star, but his
wildness<br>
prevented, and only on very rare days could he control the
ball.</p>

<p>Luckily for old Bannister's chances of victory and the
Championship, this<br>
was one of the elongated Ichabod's rare days. He ambled into the
box, with<br>
the bases full, and promptly struck out a batter. The next rolled
to first,<br>
forcing out the runner at home, while the third hitter under
Ichabod's<br>
r&eacute;gime drove out a long fly to center-field. Thus the game
settled to one<br>
of the most memorable contests that Ballard Field had ever
witnessed, a<br>
pitchers' battle between the awkward, bean-pole youth from
"Bedwell Center,<br>
Pa.," and Bob Forsythe, the crack Ballard twirler. It was a fight
long<br>
to be remembered, with hits as scarce as auks' eggs, and runs out
of the<br>
reckoning, for six innings.</p>

<p>At the start of the seventh, with the Ballard rooters standing
and<br>
thundering, "The lucky seventh! Ballard&mdash;win the game in the
lucky<br>
seventh!" the score was 0-0. Only two hits had been made off
Forsythe, of<br>
Ballard, whose change of pace had the Bannister nine at his
mercy, and<br>
but three off Ichabod, who had superb control of his dazzling
speed. T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., cavorting in right field, had made the only
error of<br>
the contest, dropping an easy fly that fell into his hands after
he had run<br>
bewilderedly in circles, when any good fielder could have stood
still and<br>
captured it; however, since he got the ball to second in time to
hold the<br>
runner at third, no harm resulted.</p>

<p>"Hold 'em, Bannister, <i>hold</i> 'em!" entreated Butch
Brewster, as they went<br>
to the field at their end of the lucky seventh, not having
scored. "Do your<br>
best, Hicks, old man&mdash;never mind their Jokes. If you can't
<i>catch</i><br>
the ball, just get it to second, or first, without delay! Pitch
ball,<br>
Ichabod&mdash;three innings to hold 'em!"</p>

<p>But it was destined to be the lucky seventh for Ballard. An
error on a hard<br>
chance, for Roddy Perkins, at third, placed a runner on first.
Ichabod<br>
struck out a hitter, and the runner stole second, aided somewhat
by the<br>
umpire. The next player flew out, sacrificing the runner to
third; then&mdash;an<br>
easy fly traveled toward the paralyzed T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
one that<br>
anybody with the most infinitesimal baseball ability could have
corralled,<br>
as Butch said, "with his eyes blindfolded, and his hands tied
behind him!"<br>
But Hicks, who possessed absolutely <i>no</i> baseball talent,
though he made<br>
a desperate try, succeeded in doing an European juggling act for
five<br>
heartbreaking seconds, after which he let the law of gravity act
on the<br>
sphere, so that it descended to terra firma. Hence, the "Lucky
Seventh"<br>
ended with the score: Ballard, 1; Bannister, 0; and the Ballard
cohorts in<br>
a state bordering on lunacy!</p>

<p>"Oh, I've done it now&mdash;I've lost the game and the
Championship!" groaned<br>
the crushed Hicks, as he stumbled toward the Bannister bench.
"First I made<br>
that bonehead play, giving Skeet an old time-table I had on hand,
and not<br>
telling him to get one at the station. How was I to know the old
railroad<br>
would change the schedule, within two weeks of this game? And
now&mdash;I've<br>
made the error that gives Ballard the Championship. If I hadn't
pulled that<br>
boner, Skeet would be here, and the regular right-fielder would
have had<br>
that fly. What a glorious climax to my athletic career at old
Bannister!"</p>

<p>Hicks' comrades were too generous, or heartbroken, to condemn
the sorrowful<br>
youth, as he trailed to the dug-out, but the Ballard rooters had
absolutely<br>
no mercy, and they panned him in regulation style. In fact, all
through<br>
the game, Hicks expressed himself as being butchered by the fans
to make a<br>
Ballard holiday, for he struck out with unfailing regularity at
bat, and<br>
dropped everything in the field, so that the rooters jeered him,
whenever<br>
he stepped to the plate, and&mdash;it was quite different from
the good-natured<br>
ridicule of his comrades, back at old Bannister.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Hicks," said good Butch Brewster, brokenly,
seeing how<br>
sorrow-stricken his sunny classmate was, "We'll beat
'em&mdash;yet! We bat this<br>
inning, and in the ninth maybe someone will knock a home-run for
us, and<br>
tie the score."</p>

<p>The eighth Inning was the lucky one for the Gold and Green.
Monty<br>
Merriweather opened with a clean two-base hit to left, and
advanced to<br>
third on Biff Pemberton's sacrifice to short. Butch, trying to
knock a<br>
home-run, struck out-&agrave; la "Cactus" Cravath in the World's
Series; but the<br>
lanky Ichabod, endeavoring to bunt, dropped a Texas-Leaguer over
second,<br>
and the score was tied, though the sky-scraper twirler was caught
off base<br>
a moment later. And, though Ballard fought hard in the last of
the eighth,<br>
Ichabod displayed big-league speed, and retired two hitters by
the<br>
strike-out route, while the third popped out to first.</p>

<p>"The <i>ninth</i> Inning!" breathed Beef McNaughton, picking
up his Louisville<br>
Slugger, as he strode to the plate. "Come on, boys&mdash;we will
win the<br>
Championship <i>right now</i>. Get one run, and Ichabod will hold
Ballard one<br>
more time!"</p>

<p>Perhaps the pachydermic Beef's grim attitude unnerved the
wonderful Bob<br>
Forsythe, for he passed that elephantine youth. However, he
regained his<br>
splendid control, and struck out Cherub Challoner on three
pitched balls.<br>
After this, it was a shame to behold the Ballard first-baseman
drop the<br>
ball, when Don Carterson grounded to third, and would have been
thrown<br>
out with ease&mdash;with two on base, and one out, Roddy Perkins
made a sharp<br>
single, on which the two runners advanced a base. Now, with the
sacks<br>
filled, and with only one out&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's all over!" mourned Captain Butch Brewster, rocking back
and forth on<br>
the bench. "Hicks&mdash;is&mdash;at&mdash;bat!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., his bat wobbling, and his knees acting
in a similar<br>
fashion, refusing to support even that fragile frame, staggered
toward the<br>
plate, like a martyr. A tremendous howl of unearthly joy went up
from the<br>
stands, for Hicks had struck out every time yet.</p>

<p>"Three pitched balls, Bob!" was the cry. "Strike him out! It's
all over but<br>
the shouting! He's scared to death, Forsythe&mdash;he can't hit a
barn-door<br>
with a scatter-gun! One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;out! Here's
where Ballard wins the<br>
Championship."</p>

<p>Twice the grinning Bob Forsythe cut loose with blinding
speed&mdash;twice the<br>
extremely alarmed Hicks dodged back, and waved a feeble
Chautauqua salute<br>
at the ball he never even saw! Then&mdash;trying to "cut the
inside corner" with<br>
a fast inshoot, Forsythe's control wavered a trifle, and T.
Haviland Hicks,<br>
Jr., saw the ball streaking toward him! The paralyzed youth felt
like a man<br>
about to be shot by a burglar. He could feel the bail thud
against him,<br>
feel the terrific shock; and yet&mdash;a thought instinctively
flashed on him,<br>
he remembered, in a flash, what a tortured Monty Merriweather had
shouted,<br>
as he wobbled to bat:</p>

<p>"Get a base on balls, or&mdash;if you can't <i>make</i> a
hit&mdash;<i>get hit</i>!"</p>

<p>If he got hit&mdash;it meant a run forced in, as the bases
were full! That, in<br>
all probability, would give old Bannister the Championship, for
Ichabod was<br>
invincible. It is not likely that the dazed Hicks thought all
this out, and<br>
weighed it against the agony of getting hit by Forsythe's speed.
The truth<br>
is, the paralyzed youth was too petrified by fear to dodge, and
that before<br>
he could avoid it, the speeding spheroid crashed against his
noble brow<br>
with a sickening impact.</p>

<p>All went black before him, T, Haviland Hicks, Jr., pale and
limp, crumpled,<br>
and slid to the ground, senseless; therefore, he failed to hear
the roar<br>
from the Bannister bench, from the loyal Gold and Green rooters
in the<br>
stands, as big Beef lumbered across the plate with what proved
later to be<br>
the winning run. He did not hear the Umpire shout: "Take your
base!"</p>

<p>  "What's the matter with our Hicks&mdash;he's all right!<br>
  What's the matter with our Hicks&mdash;he's all right!<br>
  He was never a star in the baseball game,<br>
  But he won the Championship just the same&mdash;<br>
  What's the matter with our Hicks-he's all right!"</p>

<p>"Honk! Honk!" Old Dan Flannagan's jitney-bus, rattling up the
driveway,<br>
bearing back to the Bannister campus the victorious Gold and
Green nine,<br>
and the State Intercollegiate Baseball Championship, though the
hour was<br>
midnight, found every student on the grass before the Senior
Fence! Over<br>
three hundred leather-lunged youths, aided by the Bannister Band,
and every<br>
known noise-making device, hailed "The Dove," as that unseaworthy
craft<br>
halted before them, with the baseball nine inside, and on top.
However, the<br>
terrific tumult stilled, as the bewildered collegians caught the
refrain<br>
from the exuberant players:</p>

<p>  "He was never a star in the baseball game&mdash;<br>
  But he won the Championship just the same&mdash;<br>
  What's the matter with our Hicks&mdash;he's all right!"</p>

<p>"Hicks did what?" shrieked Skeezicks McCracken, voicing
through a megaphone<br>
the sentiment of the crowd. Captain Butch had simply telegraphed
the final<br>
score, so old Bannister was puzzled to hear the team lauding T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., who, still white and weak, with a bandage around his
classic<br>
forehead, maintained a phenomenal quiet, atop of "The Dove,"
leaning<br>
against Butch Brewster.</p>

<p>"Fellows," shouted Butch, despite Hicks' protest, rising to
his feet on the<br>
roof of the "jit."&mdash;"T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., today won the
game and the<br>
Championship! Listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>The vast crowd of erstwhile clamorous youths stood spellbound,
as Captain<br>
Butch Brewster, in graphic sentences, described the
game&mdash;Don Carterson's<br>
failure, Ichabod's sensational pitching, Hicks' errors,
and&mdash;the wonderful<br>
manner in which the futile youth had won the Championship! As
little Skeet<br>
Wigglesworth and the five substitutes, who had returned that
afternoon, had<br>
spread the story of Hicks' bonehead play, old Bannister had
turned out to<br>
ridicule and jeer good-naturedly the sunny youth, but now they
learned that<br>
Hicks had been forced by his own mistake into the Big Game, and
had won it!<br>
Of course, his comrades knew it had been through no ability of
his, but the<br>
knowledge that he had been knocked senseless by Forsythe's great
speed, and<br>
had suffered so that his college might score, thrilled them.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Hicks?" thundered Thor, he who at one
time would<br>
have called this riot foolishness, and forgetting that the nine
had just<br>
chanted the response to this query.</p>

<p>"He's all right!" chorused the collegians, in ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Who's all right?" demanded John Thorwald, his blond head
towering over<br>
those of his comrades. To him, now, there was nothing silly about
this<br>
performance!</p>

<p>"Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!" came the shout, and the band fanfared,
while the<br>
exultant collegians shouted, sang, whistled, and created an
indescribable<br>
tumult with their noise-making devices. For five minutes the
ear-splitting<br>
din continued, a wonderful tribute to the lovable, popular youth,
and then<br>
it stilled so suddenly that the result was startling,
for&mdash;T. Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., swaying on his feet arose, and stood on the roof of
the "jit."</p>

<p>With that heart-warming Cheshire cat grin on his cherubic
countenance, the<br>
irrepressible Hicks seized a Louisville Slugger, assumed a
Home-Run Baker<br>
batting pose, and shouted to his breathlessly waiting
comrades:</p>

<p>"Fellows, I vowed I would win that baseball game and the
Championship for<br>
my Alma Mater by my headwork! With the bases full, and the score
a tie, the<br>
Ballard pitcher hit me in the head with the ball, forcing in the
run that<br>
won for old Ballard&mdash;now, if that wasn't
<i>headwork</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XIX</p>

<p>BANNISTER GIVES HICKS A SURPRISE PARTY</p>

<p>  "We have come to the close of our college days.<br>
  Golden campus years soon must end;<br>
  From Bannister we shall go our ways&mdash;<br>
  And friend shall part from friend!<br>
  On our Alma Mater now we gaze,<br>
  And our eyes are filled with tears;<br>
  For we've come to the close of our college days,<br>
  And the end of our campus years!"</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., Bannister, '92; Yale, '96, and
Pittsburgh<br>
millionaire "Steel King," stood at the window of Thomas Haviland
Hicks,<br>
Jr.'s, room, his arm across the shoulders of that sunny-souled
Senior, his<br>
only son and heir. Father and son stood, gazing down at the
campus. On the<br>
Gym steps was a group of Seniors, singing songs of old Bannister,
songs<br>
tinged with sadness. Up to Hicks' windows, on the warm June:
night, drifted<br>
the 1916 Class Ode, to the beautiful tune, "A Perfect Day." Over
before the<br>
Science Hall, a crowd of joyous alumni laughed over narratives of
their<br>
campus escapades. Happy undergraduates, skylarking on the
campus,<br>
celebrated the end of study, and gazed with some awe at the
Seniors, in cap<br>
and gown, suddenly transformed into strange beings, instead of
old comrades<br>
and college-mates.</p>

<p>"'The close of our college days, and the end of our campus
years&mdash;!'"<br>
quoted Mr. Hicks, a mist before his eyes as he gazed at the
scene. "In a<br>
few days, Thomas, comes the final parting from old
Bannister&mdash;I know it<br>
will be hard, for I had to leave the dear old college, and also
Yale. But<br>
you have made a splendid record in your studies, you have been
one of<br>
the most popular fellows here, and&mdash;you have vastly pleased
your Dad, by<br>
winning your B in the high-jump."</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, last study-sprint was at an end, the
final Exams.<br>
of his Senior year had been passed with what is usually termed
flying<br>
colors; and to the whole-souled delight of the lovable youth, he
and little<br>
Theophilus Opperdyke, the Human Encyclopedia, had, as Hicks
chastely<br>
phrased it, "run a dead heat for the Valedictory!" So close had
their<br>
final averages been that the Faculty, after much consideration,
decided to<br>
announce at the Commencement exercises that the two Seniors had
tied for<br>
the highest collegiate honors, and everyone was satisfied with
the verdict.<br>
So, now it was all ended; the four years of study, athletics,
campus<br>
escapades, dormitory skylarking&mdash;the golden years of college
life, were<br>
about to end for 1919. Commencement would officially start on the
morrow,<br>
but tonight, in the Auditorium, would be held the annual
Athletic<br>
Association meeting, when those happy athletes who had won their
B during<br>
the year would have it presented, before the assembled
collegians, by<br>
one-time gridiron, track, and diamond heroes of old
Bannister.</p>

<p>And&mdash;the ecstatic Hicks would have his track B, his white
letter, won in<br>
the high-jump, thanks to Caesar Napoleon's assistance, awarded
him by his<br>
beloved Dad, the greatest all-round athlete that ever wore the
Gold and<br>
Green! Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., <i>en route</i> to New
Haven and Yale in<br>
his private car, "Vulcan," had reached town that day, together
with other<br>
members of Bannister College, Class of '92. They, as did all the
old<br>
grads., promptly renewed past memories and associations by riding
up to<br>
College Hill in Dan Flannagan's jitney-bus&mdash;a youthful,
hilarious crowd of<br>
alumni. Former students, alumni, parents of graduating Seniors,
friends,<br>
sweethearts&mdash;every train would bring its quota. The campus
would again<br>
throb and pulsate with that perennial
quickening&mdash;Commencement. Three days<br>
of reunions, Class Day exercises, banquets, and other events,
then the<br>
final exercises, and&mdash;T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., would be an
alumnus!</p>

<p>"It's like Theophilus told Thor, last fall, Dad," said the
serious Hicks.<br>
"You know what Shakespeare said: 'This thou perceivest, which
makes thy<br>
love more strong; To love that well which thou must leave ere
long.' Now<br>
that I soon shall leave old Bannister, I&mdash;I wish I had
studied more, had<br>
done bigger things for my Alma Mater! And for you, Dad, too; I've
won a B,<br>
but perhaps, had I trained and exercised more, I might have
annexed another<br>
letter&mdash;still; hello, what's Butch hollering&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, his pachydermic frame draped in his gown,
and his<br>
mortar-board cap on his head, for the Seniors were required to
wear their<br>
regalia during Commencement week, was bellowing through a
megaphone, as he<br>
stood on the steps of Bannister Hall, and Mr. Hicks, with his
cheerful son,<br>
listened:</p>

<p>"Everybody&mdash;Seniors, Undergrads., Alumni&mdash;in the
Auditorium at eight sharp!<br>
We are going to give Mr. Hicks and T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., a
surprise<br>
party&mdash;don't miss the fun!"</p>

<p>"Now, just what does Butch mean, Dad?" queried the bewildered
Senior.<br>
"Something is in the wind. For two days, the fellows have had a
secret<br>
from me&mdash;they whisper and plot, and when I approach, loudly
talk of<br>
athletics, or Commencement! Say, Butch&mdash;Butch&mdash;I ain't
a-comin' tonight,<br>
unless you explain the mystery."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you be, old sport!" roared Butch, from the campus,
employing the<br>
megaphone, "or you don't get your letter! Say, Hicks, one sweetly
solemn<br>
thought attacks me&mdash;old Bannister is puzzling <i>you</i>
with a mystery, instead<br>
of vice versa, as is usually the case."</p>

<p>"Well, Thomas," said Mr. Hicks, his face lighted by a
humorous, kindly<br>
smile, as he heard the storm of good-natured jeers at Hicks, Jr.,
that<br>
greeted Butch Brewster's fling, "I'll stroll downtown, and see if
any of<br>
my old comrades came on the night express. I'll see you at the
Athletic<br>
Association meeting, for I believe I am to hand you the B. I
can't imagine<br>
what this 'surprise party' is, but I don't suppose it will harm
us. It will<br>
surely be a happy moment, son, when I present you with the
athletic letter<br>
you worked so hard to win."</p>

<p>When T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.'s, beloved Dad had gone, his firm
stride<br>
echoing down the corridor, that blithesome, irrepressible
collegian, whom<br>
old Bannister had come to love as a generous, sunny-souled youth,
stood<br>
again by the window, gazing out at the campus. Now, for the first
time, he<br>
fully realized what a sad occasion a college Commencement really
is&mdash;to<br>
those who must go forth from their Alma Mater forever. With
almost the<br>
force of a staggering blow, Hicks suddenly saw how it would hurt
to leave<br>
the well-loved campus and halls of old Bannister, to go from
those comrades<br>
of his golden years. In a day or so, he must part from good
Butch, Pudge,<br>
Beef, Ichabod, Monty, Roddy, Cherub, loyal little Theophilus and
all his<br>
classmates of '19, as well as from his firm friends of the
undergraduates.<br>
It would be the parting from the youths of his class that would
cost him<br>
the greatest regret. Four years they had lived together the
care-free<br>
campus life. From Freshmen to Seniors they had grown and
developed<br>
together, and had striven for 1919 and old Bannister, while a
love for<br>
their Alma Mater had steadily possessed their hearts. And now
soon they<br>
must sing, "Vale, Alma Mater!" and go from the campus and
corridors, as<br>
Jack Merritt, Heavy Hughes, Biff McCabe, and many others had done
before<br>
them.</p>

<p>Of course, they would return to old Bannister. There would be
alumni<br>
banquets at mid-year and Commencement, with glad class reunions
each year.<br>
They would come back for the big games of the football or
baseball season.<br>
But it would never be the same. The glad, care-free, golden years
of<br>
college life come but once, and they could never live them, as of
old.</p>

<p>"Caesar's Ghost!" ejaculated T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., making a
dive for his<br>
beloved banjo, as he awakened to the startling fact that for some
time he<br>
had been intensely serious. "This will never, never do. I must
maintain my<br>
blithesome buoyancy to the end, and entertain old Bannister with
my musical<br>
ability. Here goes."</p>

<p>Assuming a striking pose, &agrave; la troubadour, at the open
window, T.<br>
Haviland Hicks, Jr., a somewhat paradoxical figure, his
splinter-structure<br>
enshrouded in the gown, the cap on his classic head, this regalia
symbolic<br>
of dignity, and the torturesome banjo in his grasp, twanged a
ragtime<br>
accompaniment, and to the bewilderment of the old Grads on the
campus, as<br>
well as the wrath of 1919, he roared in his fog-horn voice:</p>

<p>  "Oh, I love for to live in the country!<br>
  And I love for to live on the farm!<br>
  I love for to wander in the grass-green fields&mdash;<br>
  Oh, a country life has the charm!<br>
  I love for to wander in the garden&mdash;<br>
  Down by the old haystack;<br>
  Where the pretty little chickens go 'Kick-Kack-Kackle!'<br>
  And the little docks go 'Quack! Quack!'"</p>

<p>From the Seniors on the Gym steps, their dignified song rudely
shattered by<br>
this rollicking saenger-fest, came a storm of protests; to the
unbounded<br>
delight of the alumni, watching the scene with interest, shouts,
jeers,<br>
whistles, and cat-calls greeted Hicks' minstrelsy:</p>

<p>"Tear off his cap and gown&mdash;he's a disgrace to '19!"</p>

<p>"Shades of Schumann-Heink&mdash;give that calf more rope!"</p>

<p>"Ye gods&mdash;how long must we endure&mdash;that?"</p>

<p>"Hicks, a Senior&mdash;nobody home&mdash;can that noise!"</p>

<p>"Shoot him at sunrise! Where's his Senior dignity?"</p>

<p>Big Butch Brewster, referring to his watch, bellowed through
the megaphone<br>
that it was nearly eight o'clock, and loudly suggested that they
forcibly<br>
terminate Hicks' saengerfest, and spare the town police force a
riot call<br>
to the campus, by transporting the pestiferous youth to the
Auditorium,<br>
for his "surprise party." His idea finding favor, he, with Beef
and Pudge,<br>
somewhat hampered by their gowns, lumbered up the stairway of
Bannister,<br>
and down the third-floor corridor to the offending Hicks'
boudoir, followed<br>
by a yelling, surging crowd of Seniors and underclassmen. They
invaded the<br>
graceless youth's room, much to the pretended alarm of that
torturesome<br>
collegian, who believed that the entire student-body of old
Bannister had<br>
foregathered to wreak vengeance on his devoted head.</p>

<p>"Mercy! Have a heart, fellows!" plead T. Haviland Hicks, Jr.,
helpless in<br>
the clutches of Butch, Beef, and Pudge, "I won't never do it no
more, no<br>
time! Say, this is too much&mdash;much too much&mdash;too much
much too much&mdash;I,<br>
Oh&mdash;<i>help&mdash;aid&mdash;succor&mdash;relief&mdash;assistance&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>"To the Auditorium with the wretch!" boomed Butch; and the
splinter-youth<br>
was borne aloft, on his broad shoulders, assisted by Beef
McNaughton. They<br>
transported the grinning Hicks down the corridor, while fifty
noisy youths,<br>
howling, "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow!" tramped after them.
Downstairs<br>
and across the campus the hilarious procession marched, and into
the<br>
Auditorium, where the students and alumni were gathering for the
awarding<br>
of the athletic B. A thunderous shout went up, as T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
was carried to the stage and deposited in a chair.</p>

<p>"Hicks! Hicks! Hicks! We've got a surprise
for&mdash;Hicks!"</p>

<p>"Now, just what have I did to deserve all these?" grinned
that<br>
happy-go-lucky youth, puzzled, nevertheless. "Well, time will
tell, so all<br>
I can do is to possess my soul with impatience; old Bannister has
a mystery<br>
for me, this trip!"</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes, the Athletic Association meeting opened.
On the stage,<br>
beside its officers, were those athletes, including T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
who were to receive that coveted reward&mdash;their B, together
with a number of<br>
one-time famous Bannister gridiron, track, basketball, and
diamond stars.<br>
Each youth was to receive his monogram from some ex-athlete who
once wore<br>
the Gold and Green, and Hicks' beloved Dad&mdash;Bannister's
greatest hero&mdash;was<br>
to present his son with the letter.</p>

<p>There were speeches; the Athletic Association's President
explained the<br>
annual meeting, former Bannister students and athletic idols told
of past<br>
triumphs on Bannister Field; the football Championship banner,
and the<br>
baseball pennant were flaunted proudly, and each team-captain of
the year<br>
was called upon to talk. Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., a great
favorite<br>
on the campus, delivered a ringing speech, an appeal to the
undergraduates<br>
for clean living, and honorable sportsmanship, and then:</p>

<p>"We now come to the awarding of the athletic B," stated the
President. "The<br>
Secretary will call first the name of the athlete, and then the
alumnus who<br>
will present him with the letter. In the name of the Athletic
Association<br>
of old Bannister, I congratulate those fellows who are now to be
rewarded<br>
for their loyalty to their Alma Mater!"</p>

<p>Thrilled, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., watched his comrades, as
they responded<br>
to their names, and had the greatest glory, the B, placed in
their hands by<br>
past Bannister athletic heroes. Butch, Beef, Roddy, Monty,
Ichabod, Biff,<br>
Hefty, Tug, Buster, Deacon Radford, Cherub, Don, Skeet, Thor, who
had<br>
won the hammer-throw. These, and many others, having earned the
award by<br>
playing in three-fourths of a season's games on the eleven or the
nine, or<br>
by winning a first place in some track event, stepped forward,
and were<br>
rewarded. Some, as good Butch, had gained their B many times, but
the fact<br>
that this was their last letter, made the occasion a sad one.
Every name<br>
was called but that of T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., and that perturbed
youth<br>
wondered at the omission, when the President spoke:</p>

<p>"The last name," he said, smiling, "is that of Thomas Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
and we are glad to have his father present the letter to his son,
as Mr.<br>
Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., is with us. However, we Bannister
fellows have<br>
prepared a surprise party for our lovable comrade, and I beg your
patience<br>
awhile, as I explain."</p>

<p>Graphically, Dad Pendleton described the wonderful all-round
athletic<br>
record made by Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., while at old
Bannister, and<br>
sketched briefly but vividly his phenomenal record at Yale; he
told of<br>
Mr. Hicks' great ambition, for his only son, Thomas, to follow in
his<br>
footsteps&mdash;to be a star athlete, and shatter the marks made
by his Dad.<br>
Then he reminded the Bannister students of T. Haviland Hicks,
Jr.'s,<br>
athletic fiascos, hilarious and otherwise, of three years. He
explained how<br>
that cheery youth, grinning good-humoredly at his comrades'
jeers, had been<br>
in earnest, striving to realize his father's ambition. As the
spellbound<br>
collegians and grads. listened, Dad chronicled Hicks' dogged
persistence,<br>
and how he finally, in his Senior year, won his track B in the
high-jump.<br>
Then he described the biggest game of the past football season,
the contest<br>
that brought the Championship to old Bannister. The youths and
alumni heard<br>
how T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., made a great sacrifice, for the
greater goal;<br>
how, after training faithfully in secret for a year, hoping
sometime to win<br>
a game for his Alma Mater, he cheerfully sacrificed his chance to
tie the<br>
score by a drop-kick, and became the pivotal part of a fake-kick
play that<br>
won for the Gold and Green.</p>

<p>"I have left Hicks' name until last," said Dad, with a smile,
"because<br>
tonight we have a surprise party for our sunny comrade, and for
his Dad. In<br>
the past, the eligibility rule, as regards the football and
baseball B, has<br>
been&mdash;an athlete must play on the 'Varsity in three-fourths
of the season's<br>
games. But, just before the Hamilton game, last fall, the
Advisory Board of<br>
the Athletic Association amended this rule.</p>

<p>"We decided to submit to the required two-thirds majority vote
of the<br>
students this plan, inasmuch as many athletes, toiling and
sacrificing all<br>
season for their college, never get to win their letter, yet
deserve<br>
that reward for their loyalty, we suggested that Bannister
imitate the<br>
universities. Anyone sent into the Yale-Harvard game, you know,
wins his<br>
H or Y. If one team is safely ahead, a lot of scrubs are run into
the<br>
scrimmage, to give them their letter. Therefore, we&mdash;the
Advisory<br>
Board&mdash;made this rule: 'Any athlete taking part, for any
period of time<br>
whatsoever, in the Ballard football or baseball game as a regular
member of<br>
the first team shall be eligible for his Gold or Green B. This
rule, upon<br>
approval of the students, to be effective from September 25!'</p>

<p>"Now," continued the Athletic Association President, "we
decided to keep<br>
this new ruling a secret until the present, for this reason: Many
good<br>
football and baseball players, not making the first teams, lack
the loyalty<br>
to stick on the scrubs, and others, not as brilliant, but with
more<br>
college spirit, give their best until the season's end. We knew
that if we<br>
announced this rule last fall, several slackers, who had quit the
squad,<br>
would come out again, just on the hope of getting sent into the
Ballard<br>
game, for their B. This would not be fair to those who loyally
stuck to the<br>
scrubs. So we did not announce the rule until the year closed,
and then a<br>
practically unanimous vote of the students made the rule
effective from<br>
September 25. So&mdash;all athletes who took part in the Ballard
football game,<br>
last fall, for any period of time whatsoever, are eligible for
the gold B,<br>
and the same, as regards the green letter, applies to the Ballard
baseball<br>
game this spring."</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., gasped. Slowly, the glorious truth
dawned on the<br>
happy-go-lucky Senior&mdash;he had been sent into the
Bannister-Ballard football<br>
game; the crucial and deciding play had turned on him, hence he
had won his<br>
gold letter! And thanks to his brilliant "mismanaging" of the
nine, losing<br>
shortstop Skeet Wigglesworth and the substitutes, he had played
the entire<br>
nine innings of the Ballard-Bannister baseball contest, and,
therefore,<br>
was eligible for his green B. In a dazed condition, he heard Dad
Pendleton<br>
saying:</p>

<p>"You remember how T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., was sent into the
Ballard<br>
game, and how the fake-play fooled Ballard, who believed he would
try<br>
a drop-kick? Well, knowing Hicks to be eligible for his football
B, we<br>
planned a surprise party. The Advisory Board kept the new rule a
secret,<br>
and not until this week was it voted on. Then, the required
two-thirds<br>
majority made it effective from last September&mdash;we managed
to have Hicks<br>
absent from the voting, and the fellows helped us with our
surprise! So<br>
instead of Mr. Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr., presenting his son
with one<br>
B, that for track work, we are glad to hand him <i>three</i>
letters, one for<br>
football, one for baseball, and one for track, to give our own T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr. And, let me add, he can accept them with a clear
conscience, for<br>
when the rule was made by the Advisory Board, we had no idea that
Hicks<br>
would ever be eligible in football or baseball,"</p>

<p>A moment of silence, and then undergraduates and alumni,
thrilled at Dad<br>
Pendleton's announcement, arose in a body, and howled for T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., and his beloved Dad. Mr. Hicks, unable to speak,
silently<br>
placed the three monograms, gold, green, and white, in his son's
hands, and<br>
placed his own on the shoulders of that sunny-souled Senior, who
for once<br>
in his heedless career could not say a word!</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Hicks?" Big Butch Brewster roared, and
a terrific<br>
response sounded:</p>

<p>"He's all right! Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!"</p>

<p>For ten minutes pandemonium reigned. Then, regardless of the
fact that, in<br>
order to surprise Mr. Hicks and his son, other athletes, eligible
under the<br>
new rule, had yet to be presented with their B, the howling
youths swarmed<br>
on the stage, hoisted the grinning T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., and
his happy<br>
Dad to their shoulders, and started a wild parade around the
campus and the<br>
Quadrangle, singing:</p>

<p>"Here's to our own Hicks&mdash;drink it down! Drink it down!
Here's to our own<br>
Hicks&mdash;drink it down! Drink it down! Here's to our own
Hicks&mdash;When he<br>
starts a thing, he sticks&mdash;Drink it down&mdash;drink it
down&mdash;down! Down!<br>
Down!"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., aloft on the shoulders of his behemoth
class-mate,<br>
Butch Brewster, was deliriously happy. The surprise party of his
campus<br>
comrades was a wonderful one, and he could scarcely realize that
he had<br>
actually, by the Athletic Association ruling, won his three B's!
How glad<br>
his beloved Dad, was, too. He had not expected this bewildering
happiness.<br>
He had been so joyous, when his sort earned the track letter, but
to<br>
have him leave old Bannister, with a B for three sports&mdash;it
was almost<br>
unbelievable! And, as Dad had said&mdash;there had been no
thought of Hicks when<br>
the Advisory Board made the rule, so Hicks had no reason to
suppose it was<br>
done just to award him his letter.</p>

<p>Then, Hicks remembered that rash vow, made at the end of his
Freshman year,<br>
a vow uttered with absolutely no other thought than a desire to
torment<br>
Butch Brewster, "Before I graduate from old Bannister, I shall
have won<br>
my B in three branches of sport!" Never, not even for a moment,
had the<br>
happy-go-lucky youth believed that his wild prophecy would be
fulfilled,<br>
though he had pretended to be confident to tease his loyal
comrades; but<br>
now, at the very end of his campus days, just before he
graduated, his<br>
prediction had come true! So the sunny Senior, who four years
before had<br>
made his rash vow, saw its realization, and suddenly thrilled
with the<br>
knowledge that he had a golden opportunity to make Butch
indignant.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Butch," he drawled, nonchalantly, leaning down to
talk in<br>
Butch's ear, "do you recall that day, at the close of our
Freshman year,<br>
when I vowed to win my B in three branches of sport, ere I bade
farewell to<br>
old Bannister?"</p>

<p>"No, you don't get away with that!" exploded Butch Brewster,
indignantly,<br>
lowering his tantalizing classmate to terra firma. "Here, Beef,
Pudge,<br>
catch this wretch; he intends to swagger and say&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was too late, for T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., dodging from
his grasp,<br>
imitated the celebrated Charley Chaplin strut, and satiated his
fun-loving<br>
soul. After waiting for three years, the irrepressible youth
realized an<br>
ambition he had never imagined would be fulfilled.</p>

<p>"Oh, just leave it to Hicks!" quoth he, gladsomely. "I told
you I'd win<br>
my three B's, Butch, old top, and&mdash;<i>ow</i>!&mdash;unhand
me, you villain, you<br>
<i>hurt</i>!"</p>

<p><br>
CHAPTER XX</p>

<p>"VALE, ALMA MATER!"</p>

<p>  "Oh, it was 'Ave, Alma Mater&mdash;'<br>
  We sang as Freshmen gay;<br>
  But it's 'Vale, Alma Mater' now<br>
  As our last farewells we say!"</p>

<p>"Honk-Honk! Br-r-rr-r-Bang! Honk-Monk! Br-rr-rr-r&mdash;"</p>

<p>T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., big Butch Brewster, Beef McNaughton,
Pudge Langdon,<br>
Scoop Sawyer, and little Theophilus Opperdyke&mdash;late Seniors
of old<br>
Bannister&mdash;roosted atop of good old Dan Flannagan's famous
jitney-bus<br>
before Bannister Hall. It was nearly time for the 9.30 A. M.
express, but<br>
the "peace-ship" had inconsiderately stalled, and the choking,
wheezing,<br>
and snorting of the engine, as old Dan frenziedly cranked,
together with<br>
the Claxon, operated by Skeet Wigglesworth, rudely interrupted
the Seniors'<br>
chant. A vociferous protest arose above the tumult:</p>

<p>"Oh, the little old Ford&mdash;rambled right along&mdash;like
heck!"</p>

<p>"Can that noise-we want to sing a last song, boys!"</p>

<p>"Chuck that engine, Dan, and put in an alarm clock
spring!"</p>

<p>"Christmas is coming, Dan-u-el&mdash;we've graduated you
know!"</p>

<p>"'The Dove' doesn't want us to leave old Bannister,
fellows!"</p>

<p>Commencement was ended. The night before, on the stage of
Alumni Hall,<br>
before a vast audience of old Bannister grads, undergraduates,
friends, and<br>
relatives of the Seniors, the Class of 1919 had received its
sheepskins,<br>
and the "Go forth, my children, and live!" of its Alma Mater. T,
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., and timorous little Theophilus had jointly delivered
the<br>
Valedictory, eight other Seniors, including Butch, Scoop, and the
lengthy<br>
Ichabod, had swayed the crowd with oratory. Kindly old Prexy, his
voice<br>
tremulous, had talked to them, as students, for the last time.
The Class<br>
Ode had been sung, the Class Shield unveiled, and
then&mdash;Hicks and his<br>
comrades of '19 were alumni!</p>

<p>It had been a busy, thrilling time, Commencement Week. There
had been<br>
scarcely any spare moments to ponder on the parting so soon to
come; after<br>
the memorable Athletic Association meeting, when T. Haviland
Hicks, Jr.,<br>
and his beloved Dad had been given a wonderful "surprise party"
by the<br>
collegians, and Hicks had corralled his three B's, time had
"sprinted with<br>
spiked shoes," as the sunny Hicks stated. Event had followed
event in<br>
bewildering fashion. The Seniors, dignified in cap and gown, had
been f&ecirc;ted<br>
and banqueted, the cynosure of all eyes. Campus and town were
filled with<br>
visitors. Old Bannister pulsated with renewed life, with the glad
reunions<br>
of former students. There had been the Alumni Banquet, the annual
baseball<br>
game between the 'Varsity and old-time Gold and Green diamond
stars, Class<br>
Night exercises, the Literary Society Oratorical Contests, and
the last<br>
Class Supper; and, Commencement had come.</p>

<p>It was all ended now&mdash;the four happy, golden years of
campus life, of glad<br>
fellowship with each other; like those who had gone before, T.
Haviland<br>
Hicks, Jr., and his comrades of 1919 had come to the final
parting. The<br>
sunny-souled youth's Dad had gone to New Haven, to Yale's
Commencement.<br>
Alumni and visitors had left town; the night before had witnessed
farewells<br>
with Monty, Roddy, Biff, Hefty, and the underclassmen, with that
awakened<br>
Colossus, John Thorwald. All the collegians had gone, except the
few<br>
Seniors now leaving, and they had remained to enjoy Hicks' final
Beefsteak<br>
Bust downtown at Jerry's.</p>

<p>The campus was silent and deserted. No footsteps or voices
echoed in the<br>
dormitories, and a shadow of sadness hovered over all. The youths
who were<br>
leaving old Bannister forever felt an ache in their throats, and
little<br>
Theophilus Opperdyke's big-rimmed spectacles were fogged with
tears. Three<br>
times, in the past, they had left the campus, but this was
forever, as<br>
collegians!</p>

<p>"I don't care if we miss the old train!" declared Scoop
Sawyer, as the<br>
jitney-Ford's engine wheezed, gasped, and was silent, for all of
Dan's<br>
cranking. "Just think, fellows, it's all over now&mdash;'We have
come to the end<br>
of our college days-golden campus years are at an end&mdash;!'
Say, Hicks, old<br>
man, what's your Idea. What future have you blue-printed?"</p>

<p>"Journalism!" announced T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., sticking a
fountain pen<br>
behind his ear, and fatuously supposing he resembled a City
Editor, "In me<br>
you behold an embryo Richard Harding Davis, or Ty&mdash;no, I
mean Irvin Cobb.<br>
I shall first serve my apprenticeship as a 'cub,' but ere many
years, I<br>
shall sit at a desk, run a newspaper, and tell the world where to
get off."</p>

<p>"That is&mdash;If Dad says so!" chuckled Butch Brewster. "You
know, Hicks, it's<br>
the same old story&mdash;your father wants you to learn how to
own steel and<br>
iron mills, and when it comes to a showdown, you must convince
Mr. Thomas<br>
Haviland Hicks, Sr., that you'd make a better journalist than
Steel King!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay-say not so!" responded the happy-go-lucky alumnus of
old<br>
Bannister, as the perspiring" Dan Flannagan cranked away
futilely. "My Dad<br>
has a broader vision, fellows, than most men. He and I talked it
over last<br>
night, and he would never try to make me take up anything but a
work that<br>
appeals to me. While, as Butch says, he'd like to train me to
follow in his<br>
footsteps, he understands my ambition so thoroughly that he is
trying to<br>
get me started&mdash;read this:"</p>

<p>The lovable youth produced a letter, the envelope bearing the
heading: "THE<br>
BALTIMORE CHRONICLE;" Butch Brewster, to whom he extended it,
read aloud:</p>

<p>"Baltimore, Maryland,</p>

<p>"June 12, 1919.</p>

<p>"DEAR OLD CLASSMATE:</p>

<p>"I'd sure like to be with you, back at old Yale, next week,
but I can't<br>
leave the wheel of this ship, the Chronicle, for even a day. Give
my<br>
regards to all of old Eli, '96, old man.</p>

<p>"As regards a berth for your son, Thomas. The Chronicle
usually takes<br>
on a few college men during the summer, when our staff is off
on<br>
vacations. We always use undergraduates, and often, in two or
three<br>
summers, we develop them into star reporters. However, for old
time's<br>
sake, I'll be glad to give your son a chance, and if he means
business,<br>
let him report for duty next Friday, at 1 P.M., to my office.<br>
Understand, Hicks, he must come here and fight his own way,
without any<br>
favor or special help from me. Were he the son of our
nation's<br>
President, I'd not treat him a whit better than the rest of the
Staff,<br>
so let him know that in advance. On the other hand, I'll develop
him all<br>
I can, and if he has the ability, the Chronicle long-room is the
place<br>
for him.</p>

<p>"Yours for old Yale,</p>

<p>"'Doc' Whalen, Yale, '96,</p>

<p>"City Editor&mdash;THE CHRONICLE."</p>

<p>"Here's my Dad's ultimatum," grinned Hicks, when. Butch
finished the<br>
letter. "I am to take a summer as a cub on the Baltimore
Chronicle,<br>
making my own way, and living on my weekly salary, without
financial aid<br>
from anyone. If, at the end of the summer, City Editor Whalen
reports that<br>
I've made good enough to be retained as a regular,
then&mdash;Yours truly for<br>
the Fourth Estate. If I fail, then I follow a course charted out
by Mr.<br>
Thomas Haviland Hicks, Sr.! So, it is up to me to make
good&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you will make good, Hicks," quavered Theophilus,
whose faith in the<br>
shadow-like youth was prodigious. "Oh, that will be splendid, for
I am<br>
going to take a course at a business college in Baltimore. I want
to become<br>
an expert stenographer, and we'll be together,"</p>

<p>"It's work now, fellows!" sighed Beef McNaughton, shifting his
huge bulk<br>
atop of the jit "College years are ended, we're chucked into the
world, to<br>
make good, or fail! Butch and I have not decided on our work yet.
We may<br>
accept jobs as bank or railroad presidents, or maybe run for
President<br>
of the U.S.A., provided John McGraw or Connie Mack do not sign us
up.<br>
However&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment, the engine of old Dan Flannagan's battered
"Dove" consented<br>
to hit on two cylinders, and the genial Irishman, who was to
transport<br>
Hicks and his comrades, as collegians, for the last time, yelled,
"All<br>
aboard!" loudly, to conceal his emotion at the sad scene.</p>

<p>"We're off!" shrieked Skeet Wigglesworth, stowed away below,
as the<br>
jitney-bus moved down the driveway. "Farewell, dear old
Bannister! Run<br>
slow, Dan, we want to gaze on the campus as long as we can."</p>

<p>The youths were silent, as the 'bus rolled slowly down the
driveway and<br>
under the Memorial Arch, old Dan, sympathizing with them, and
finding he<br>
could make the express by a safe margin, allowing the jitney to
flutter<br>
along at reduced speed. From its top, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., his
vision<br>
blurred with tears, gazed back with his class-mates. He saw the
campus, its<br>
grass green, with stately old elms bordering the walks, and the
golden<br>
June sunshine bathing everything in a soft radiance. He beheld
the college<br>
buildings&mdash;the Gym., the Science Hall, the Administration
Building,<br>
Recitation Hall, the ivy-covered Library; the white Chapel, and
the four<br>
dorms., Creighton, Smithson, Nordyke, Bannister. One year he had
spent in<br>
each, and every year had been one of happiness, of glad
comradeship.<br>
He could see Bannister Field, the scene of his many hilarious
athletic<br>
fiascos.</p>

<p>And now he was leaving it all&mdash;had come to the end of his
college course,<br>
and before him lay Life, with its stern realities, its grim
obstacles, and<br>
hard struggles; ended were the golden campus days, the gay
skylarking<br>
in the dorms. Gone forever were the joyous nights of entertaining
his<br>
comrades, of Beefsteak Busts down at Jerry's. Silenced was his
beloved<br>
banjo, and no more would his saengerfests bother old
Bannister.</p>

<p>A turn in the street, and the campus could not be seen. As the
last vision<br>
of their Alma Mater vanished, T. Haviland Hicks, Jr., smiling
sunnily<br>
through his tear-blurred eyes, gazed at his comrades of old
'19&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say, fellows&mdash;" he grinned, though his voice was shaky,
"let's&mdash;let's<br>
start in next September, and&mdash;do it all over again!"</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
