<h1>Games for Everybody</h1>

<p align="center" class="smallcaps">by</p>

<h3>May C. Hofmann</h3>

<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>Every one is fond of having a good time when invited
out to a party or social.  Sometimes a stupid evening
has been spent because either the guests were not
congenial or the hostess had not planned good games.
The purpose of this book is to furnish just what is
needed for a pleasant home gathering, church social,
or any other indoor occasion.</p>

<p>Very few, if any, of these games require much preparation.
Just use what is in the house, follow the directions
given, and a good time will be the result. Some of
the games for "Adults" can be played by
the younger ones, and <i>vice versa</i>. Other games,
by being changed a little by the hostess, can be made
to suit the occasion.</p>

<p>Many of the good old games that every one has played
are here, while the newer ones, which may be strange
at first, will prove most enjoyable when every one
has "caught on," as the saying is.  M.C.H.</p>

<h1>Part I.</h1>

<h3>Games for Children.</h3>

<a name="1"></a>
<h2>ANIMAL SHOW.</h2>

<p>An amusing game for children is one in which each
child is to make some sort of animal out of vegetables
or fruit, and toothpicks.</p>

<p>When all the children have arrived, pass around slips
of paper containing a number and the name of some
animal. Each one must keep secret what his animal
is to be.</p>

<p>Let the hostess prepare a basket of vegetables, potatoes,
beets, carrots, and fruits, lemons, bananas, etc.,
suitable for the occasion, from which the children
can take their choice to make their animals. Plenty
of toothpicks must be provided for the legs, ears and
tails.</p>

<p>Allow five minutes for constructing the creatures.</p>

<p>Then collect the specimens, pinning a number corresponding
to the one on the slip, to its back, and arrange the
"show" on a table.  Many queer sights
will be seen.</p>

<p>The children, having received pencil and paper, should
be told to write down the number of each animal, and
opposite it what the animal is intended to represent.</p>

<p>A prize can be given to the one who has guessed the
greatest number correctly.</p>

<a name="2"></a>
<h2>CHASE THE RABBIT.</h2>

<p>All the children kneel on the floor in a ring with
hands on each other's shoulders.</p>

<p>One is chosen to be the "rabbit" and runs
around outside the ring and touches one of the players,
who is to chase him to his "hole."</p>

<p>The minute the player is touched he must run to the
left, while the rabbit goes to the right, must tag
the rabbit when they pass each other and try to get
back to the "hole" again.  If he fails,
he becomes the "rabbit," and the game
goes on as before.</p>

<a name="3"></a>
<h2>SOAP-BUBBLE CONTEST.</h2>

<p>Provide each child with a clay pipe and prepare two
basins of soap suds for the game.  If a little glycerine
is put in the water, the bubbles will last longer.</p>

<p>Divide the company into two sides, an even number
in each. Stretch a cord or rope at a medium height
across the middle of the room. Two children, one from
each side, play at a time. Each stands on his side,
blows the bubble from the pipe and blows it toward
the opposite side, and over the rope if he can. If
it goes over the rope without breaking, he has won
one point for his side, if not, his side has lost.
Tally is kept as each set plays, and the side that
has the most points, wins, and surely deserves a prize.</p>

<a name="4"></a>
<h2>ROSE GUESS.</h2>

<p>Any child can play this simple game. Take a full blown
rose and hold it up where all can see it, then let
them write on a slip of paper how many petals they
think are in the rose.</p>

<p>The petals are then counted by one of the children
and the one who guesses the nearest, receives a prize.</p>

<p>Any flower with many petals, can be used.</p>

<a name="5"></a>
<h2>NEW BLIND MAN'S BUFF.</h2>

<p>The one who is chosen for the "blind man"
does not have his eyes bandaged as in the old game.</p>

<p>Stretch a sheet between two doors and place a light,
candle or lamp, on a table some distance from the
sheet. The "blind man" sits on the floor
or low chair in front of the light facing the sheet,
but he must be so low down that his shadow will not
appear on the sheet.</p>

<p>The children form a line and march single file between
the light and the "blind man," who is
not allowed to turn around. Thus their shadows are
thrown on the sheet and as they pass, the "blind
man" must guess who they are. The children may
disguise their walk and height, so as to puzzle him.</p>

<p>As soon as the "blind man" guesses one
correctly, that one takes his place and becomes "blind
man," while the former takes his place in the
procession, and the game proceeds as before, but the
children had better change places, so the new "blind
man" won't know their positions.</p>

<a name="6"></a>
<h2>FINDING FLOWERS.</h2>

<p>A very simple game for children is one played like
the old-fashioned "London Bridge."</p>

<p>Two children with joined hands stand opposite each
other, and the rest form a ring and pass under the
raised hands, while they repeat,</p>

<blockquote>"We're seeking a pansy, a
pansy, a pansy,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We've
found one here."</blockquote>

<p>As they say "here," the raised hands close
around the child who was passing by, and "Pansy"
takes the place of the one who caught her, and she
names some other flower which is to be found, and the
game goes on as before, substituting that flower for
pansy.</p>

<p>Then it continues until all the flowers are "found."</p>

<a name="7"></a>
<h2>BEAN-BAG CONTEST.</h2>

<p>Prepare an even number of bean bags of
moderate size, half of one color and half of another.</p>

<p>Appoint leaders, who choose the children for their
respective sides. There should be an even number on
each side. The opponents face each other, with the
leader at the head, who has the bag of one color at
his side.  The bags are to be passed,</p>

<blockquote>1st, with right hand, 2d, with left
hand, 3d, with both hands, 4th, with right hand
over left shoulder, 5th, with left hand over right
shoulder.</blockquote>

<p>Before the contest begins, it is best to have a trial
game, so all understand how to pass the bags.</p>

<p>At a given signal, the leaders begin, and pass the
bags as rapidly as possible down the line, observing
all the directions. The last one places them on a
chair, until all have been passed, and then he sends
them back, observing the same rules, until all have
reached the leader.</p>

<p>The side who has passed them back to the leader first,
and has done so successfully, is the winning side.</p>

<a name="8"></a>
<h2>BLOWING THE FEATHERS.</h2>

<p>The children are seated on the floor, around a sheet
or tablecloth. This is held tight by the players about
1 1/2 ft. from the floor, and a feather is placed
in the middle.</p>

<p>One is chosen to be out, and at a given signal from
the leader, the feather is blown from one to the other,
high and low, never allowed to rest once.</p>

<p>The player outside runs back and forth, trying to
catch the feather. When he does succeed, the person
on whom it rested or was nearest to, must take his
place.</p>

<a name="9"></a>
<h2>SCHOOL.</h2>

<p>The players sit in a circle, and each takes the name
of some article found in the schoolroom, such as desk,
rubber, blackboard, etc.</p>

<p>One of the players stands in the center and spins
a plate on end; as he does so, he calls out the name
of an article which one of the players has taken.</p>

<p>The person named must jump up and catch the plate
before it stops spinning.</p>

<p>If he is too slow, he must pay a forfeit. It is then
his turn to spin the plate.</p>

<a name="10"></a>
<h2>HIDE THE THIMBLE.</h2>

<p>All the players but one, leave the room. This one
hides a thimble in a place not too conspicuous, but
yet in plain sight.</p>

<p>Then the others come in, and hunt for the thimble;
the first one seeing it, sits down and remains perfectly
quiet until all the others have found it.</p>

<p>The first one who saw it, takes his turn to hide it.</p>

<a name="11"></a>
<h2>FAN BALL.</h2>

<p>Make two balls, one red and one blue, out of paper
thus--</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="1.png" src="1.png" /></p>


<p>Slip No. 1 in No. 2, and No. 3 fits over and bisects
the other two.</p>

<p>Appoint two leaders who choose their teams; each team
takes a ball and a palm leaf fan.</p>

<p>GOALS--Three chairs, one at each end of
the room and one in the center, at equal distance
from others.</p>

<p>Two play at a time, one player from each side. The
player stands in front of his goal and at the word
"ready," fans his ball to the opposite
goal. It must go through the back of the chair in the
middle of the room, and through the opposite goal,
in order to win.  When all have finished playing,
the team which has the most successful players in
it, wins the game.</p>

<a name="12"></a>
<h2>SPOOL FLOWER HUNT.</h2>

<p>Gather together as many spools as possible, marking
each with a separate letter, which, when put together,
will form the name of some flower, such as: rose,
violet, daisy, pansy, etc.  Stand all the spools
in a row, those forming names standing together.</p>

<p>One child, the gardener, gathers up all the spools
and hides them in all the corners and out-of-the-way
places in the room, only one spool being in each place.
When all are hidden, the children are summoned in
to hunt for the flowers.</p>

<p>The object is to find such spools as form a name.
As the spools are found, the children see if the letters
on them spell a flower.</p>

<p>When the hunt is over, the one having the most complete
sets of flowers is the winner.</p>

<a name="13"></a>
<h2>MARBLE CONTEST.</h2>

<p>Cut five holes of different sizes in the lid of a
pasteboard box. Number the largest hole 5; the next
largest 10; the next, 20; the next, 50; and the smallest,
100.</p>

<p>Place the box on the floor and give each child an
equal number of marbles. The object of the game is
to see which child can count the most by dropping
the marbles into the box through the holes.</p>

<p>Each player in turn stands over the box, holds his
arm out straight, even with the shoulder, and drops
the marbles one by one into the box. If one goes through
the largest hole it counts 5, if through the smallest,
100, and so on, count being kept for each player. The
one scoring the greatest number of points is the winner.</p>

<a name="14"></a>
<h2>PASSING BY.</h2>

<p>An amusement for children on a train, or at home when
it is raining, is the following, and it will help
to while away the time.</p>

<p>If there are several children, choose sides and appoint
one to keep the count for his side.  Each side sits
by a different window and watches the passers-by.
Every man counts 1; every women 2; baby 3; animal
5; white horse 10; black cat 50.</p>

<p>As a child sees someone passing, he calls out the
number for his side; if a woman, he says 2; if a man
and woman together, it will be 3, and so on.</p>

<p>If the children are looking upon the same street the
side that calls its number out first adds it to its
score. It is more exciting if the different sides
have different streets to look out on.</p>

<p>If on a train, one side sits on the right and the
other on the left, and when an object is seen, they
call out right, 5, or left, as the case may be, for
the mother, or older person to put down on the score
card.</p>

<p>The side which succeeds in reaching 100 first is the
winning side. If the trip is long, 500 can be the
limit.</p>

<a name="15"></a>
<h2>THE SERPENT'S TAIL.</h2>

<p>This is a Japanese game, and is played this way. All
the children form a line, each resting his hands on
the shoulders of the player in front of him. One child
is chosen out, and is called the "catcher."
The first child of the line, or "serpent,"
is called the "head," and the last one,
the "tail."</p>

<p>The "catcher" stands about three feet
from the "head" and when someone gives
a signal he tries to catch the "tail" without
pushing anyone, or breaking through the line.</p>

<p>The children forming the "body" defend
the "tail," by moving about in any way
they choose, but the line must never be broken, as
the "tail" is considered caught if it
is.</p>

<p>When the "tail" is caught, the "catcher"
becomes "head," and the "tail"
is then "catcher," the last child in the
line being "tail," and the game goes on
as before.</p>

<h2>LITTLE BO-PEEP.</h2>

<p>Dress the little girl in whose honor the party is
given as little Bo-peep, with a little crook.</p>

<p>Hide small toy sheep all over the room in every nook
and corner. As each child comes, give her a little
stick fixed up like a crook, and tell the children
to find the sheep.</p>

<p>After the hunt is over, award the child who found
the most sheep some little prize. Each may keep the
sheep she finds.</p>

<p>If the party is in honor of a little boy, change it
to "Little Boy Blue," and have horns instead
of crooks.</p>

<a name="17"></a>
<h2>SPOOL ARMIES.</h2>

<p>Children may derive a lot of fun from a large supply
of empty spools of all shapes and sizes.  Pieces of
cotton batting stuck in the opening at the top may
serve as heads.</p>

<p>For the "army" gather together as many
spools of the same size as you can, numbering each
one. Choose a large spool for the general.</p>

<p>Arrange them in rows with the general at the head
of a chair or box. A small ball, or pieces of muslin
knotted into small balls, will serve as ammunition.
When the battle begins, each child aims at the general,
endeavoring to knock him over, and as many others as
he can. The score is counted after each attack. If
a spool has fallen over, but not off the chair, it
counts but half its number; if on the floor, it is
"dead," and the whole number is counted.</p>

<a name="18"></a>
<h2>SPINNING FOR 20.</h2>

<p>On a board or piece of cardboard, mark with pencil
or ink, the design illustrated, the size of the circles
varying with the size of the board.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="2.png" src="2.png" /></p>

<p>A top may be made out of an empty spool by taking
one end of it and sticking a piece of wood, pointed
at one end about an inch long, through it. Each spool
makes two tops which are spun with the thumb and forefinger.
 A penny may be used to spin, in fact any small thing
that spins will do for a top.</p>

<p>Number the circles as in the diagram. Place the top
on the dot in the center of circle 20 and spin it.
The number of the circle the top stops on, is the
number scored. If on a line it counts for the circle
next it. If outside the line of circle 5 it counts
nothing.</p>

<p>Any number can play and any number, such as 100 or
more, may be the score.</p>

<a name="19"></a>
<h2>SHOE HUNT.</h2>

<p>Shoes, four inches long, are cut out of cardboard,
from patterns found in catalogues. The pairs are mixed
and hidden all over the room, high and low, behind
pictures, under mats, etc.</p>

<p>The girl or boy finding the greatest number of shoes
that prove to be pairs receives a prize.</p>

<p>To add to the merriment, several pairs of real shoes
may be hidden, too, and the children will enjoy hunting
for the mates.</p>

<a name="20"></a>
<h2>HOP-OVER.</h2>

<p>Fun for the children is in store when they play this
game. All stand in a circle, not too near each other.
One player stands in the center, holding a rope, or
stout cord, at the end of which is attached a weight
of some kind.</p>

<p>At the word "ready" the one in the center
whirls the cord rapidly around near the floor.  The
players, to prevent it from touching their feet, hop
over it as it approaches them.</p>

<p>In a short time every one is hopping and a lively
time ensues. The one whose feet were touched takes
the center place and endeavors to hit some other player's
feet.</p>

<a name="21"></a>
<h2>BOUQUET.</h2>

<p>This is played similarly to "Stage-coach."
 Any number of children can play it. One is chosen
out and is called the "gardener."</p>

<p>All the children sit in a circle and the "gardener"
gives each one in turn the name of some flower. When
all are named the "gardener" stands in
the center of the circle and tells how he has gone
to the woods to gather certain flowers, how he has
transplanted them to form a lovely garden, the care
he has to take of them, and so on, telling quite a
long story and bringing in the names of all the flowers
he has given to the children.</p>

<p>As a flower is mentioned, the child who has that name
rises, turns around, and sits down again. Anyone who
fails to rise when his flower is named must pay a
forfeit. When the gardener says something about a
bouquet, all the children rise and exchange seats.
Then the "gardener" tries to get a seat,
and if he succeeds, the person who has no seat becomes
the "gardener" and the game goes on as
before.</p>

<a name="22"></a>
<h2>MAKING SQUARES.</h2>

<p>Make a square or rectangle of dots, as shown on page
26.</p>

<p>Provide the children with pencils. Each one makes
a line joining two dots but tries to prevent the others
from making a square.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="3.png" src="3.png" /></p>

<p>For a while it is easy, but soon the number of dots
is scarce, and it requires careful marking to prevent
the squares from being formed. Finally all the chances
are gone and the next player completes a square, as
a reward he is given another chance, thus completing
several, then he joins two dots and the next player
continues.</p>

<p>Each one places his initial in his completed square,
so the score is easily counted. The one who has succeeded
in making the most squares is the winner.</p>

<a name="23"></a>
<h2>SIMPLE SIMON'S SILLY SMILE.</h2>

<p>All the players sit in a circle and one who is bright
and witty is chosen as leader. He stands in the center
of the circle and asks the most ridiculous questions
he can think of.</p>

<p>The players when asked any question, must always answer
"Simple Simon's silly smile."  No
other answer will do and whoever laughs or fails to
say it correctly, must pay a forfeit.</p>

<a name="24"></a>
<h2>TEA-POT.</h2>

<p>One player leaves the room, and while he is gone the
rest decide upon some word which has several meanings,
which he must guess when he comes in.</p>

<p>The rest of the players converse about the word, but
instead of mentioning it, say "Tea-pot"
in its place. Suppose the word chosen is "vain."
No. 1 may say: "She is altogether too tea-pot
for me." (vain) No. 2 says: "The tea-pot
pointed North yesterday." (vane) No.  3: "The
tea-pot is blue." (vein), and so on, each in
turn making some remark about the chosen word until
the player has guessed it correctly. The person who
gave the broadest hint about the hidden word must leave
the room next.</p>

<a name="25"></a>
<h2>BLIND MAN'S BUFF.</h2>

<p>It is hardly necessary to describe this game as almost
everybody knows how to play it.  There may be some
who do not know, however, so it is included here.</p>

<p>Clear the room as much as possible, pushing all the
chairs, tables, etc., against the walls.  The
child chosen as "Buff" is blindfolded,
and is asked the following question by the other children.
"How many horses has your father got?"
He answers "Three." "What color are
they?" "Black, white, and gray,"
is answered. Everyone calls out "Turn around
three times and catch whom you may."</p>

<p>"Buff" turns around, and then tries to
catch whoever he can. The children try to escape him
by dodging him until finally one is caught, and before
the handkerchief is raised, "Buff" must
guess whom he has caught. If he guesses correctly,
the one caught becomes "Buff."</p>

<a name="26"></a>
<h2>CAT AND MOUSE.</h2>

<p>The children sit in two rows facing each other, with
a space between. Blindfold two children, one being
the "cat" and the other the "mouse."</p>

<p>The "cat" stands at one end of the row
and the "mouse" at the other. They start
in opposite directions and the "cat" tries
to catch the "mouse." The children may
give hints as to the direction the players are to
go in.  When the "mouse" is caught, he
becomes "cat," and another child is chosen
as "mouse."</p>

<a name="27"></a>
<h2>MUSICAL CHAIRS.</h2>

<p>Musical Chairs, or Going to Jerusalem, is a favorite
game of the children. Someone who plays the piano
well starts up a lively tune and the children march
around a row of chairs which have been arranged facing
alternately in opposite directions. There should be
one less chair than the number of players.</p>

<p>When the music stops, each child tries to find a seat.
Someone will be left out, as there is one chair short.
This one takes another chair from the row and the
game continues until there is one child left with
no chair. This one has won the game.</p>

<a name="28"></a>
<h2>BUTTON, BUTTON.</h2>

<p>All the children sit in a circle with hands placed
palm to palm in their laps. One child is given a button
and she goes to each in turn, slipping her hands between
the palms of the children. As she goes around the
circle she drops the button into some child's
hands, but continues going around as long after as
she pleases, so the rest will not know who has it.</p>

<p>Then she stands in the middle of the circle and says:
"Button, button, who has the button?"
 All the children guess who has it, the one calling
out the correct name first is out and it is his turn
to go around with the button.</p>

<a name="29"></a>
<h2>STATUES.</h2>

<p>Arrange all the children except one on chairs or a
bench. This one is the leader and she stands on the
floor in front of the children. Beginning at one end
of the row, she pulls each child from the bench, letting
her remain in whatever position she falls. Sometimes
she can tell them how to pose, for instance, she will
say "Like an angel," and that child will
fold her hands and look upward.  Another might be
"cross school-teacher," and this child
may pretend to be scolding someone.  Each child remains
perfectly still, posed in the attitude suggested,
until all the children are on the floor. Then the leader
selects the one she thinks has posed the best and that
one takes the leader's place and the game goes
on as before.</p>

<a name="30"></a>
<h2>OUR COOK DOESN'T LIKE PEAS.</h2>

<p>All the players except one sit in a row. This one
sits in front of them and says to each one in turn:
"Our cook doesn't like P's; what
can you give her instead?"</p>

<p>The first one may answer "sugar" and that
will suit her, but the next one might say "Potatoes,"
and that will not do, and he will have to pay a forfeit
because the letter "P" comes in that word.</p>

<p>There is a catch to this as everyone thinks that the
vegetable "Peas" is meant instead of the
letter. Even after everybody has discovered the trick
it will be difficult to think of words, and if a player
fails to answer before 5 is counted, a forfeit must
be paid. "My grandma doesn't like tea
(T)" is played in the same way.</p>

<a name="31"></a>
<h2>HOLD FAST, LET GO.</h2>

<p>A simple game for small children is the following.
 Each child takes hold of a small sheet or tablecloth,
the leader holding it with his left hand, while he
pretends to write with his right hand.</p>

<p>The leader says: "When I say 'Hold fast,'
let go; and when I say 'let go,' hold
fast." He calls out the commands one at a time
and the rest do just the opposite of what he says.
 Whoever fails must pay a forfeit.</p>

<a name="32"></a>
<h2>SIMON SAYS.</h2>

<p>One child is selected to be Simon. The rest of the
children sit around in a circle. Simon stands in the
middle and gives all sorts of orders for the children
to follow. Every order which begins with "Simon
says" must be obeyed, whether Simon performs
it or not, but if Simon should give some order, such
as "Thumbs down," whether he puts his thumbs
down or not, it must not be obeyed by the others because
it was not preceded by "Simon says."</p>

<p>All sorts of orders such as "Thumbs up,"
"Thumbs down," "Thumbs wiggle-waggle,"
"Thumbs pull left ear," etc., are
given. The faster the orders are given, the more confusing
it is. A forfeit must be paid by those who fail to
obey the orders.</p>

<a name="33"></a>
<h2>OLD SOLDIER.</h2>

<p>One child, who represents the old soldier, goes around
to each child in turn and begs for something, saying
that he is poor, hungry, blind, etc., and asks
what they will do for him.</p>

<p>In answering the old soldier no one must use the words,
"Yes," "No," "Black,"
or "White." As soon as a child is asked,
he must answer immediately. If he does not, or says
any of the forbidden words, he must pay a forfeit.</p>

<a name="34"></a>
<h2>HIDE AND SEEK.</h2>

<p>One child is chosen out. This one stands by a post
or in a corner which is called "base,"
and hides his eyes. The children decide among themselves
how much he shall count while they are hiding. Suppose
they choose 100, then he counts 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.,
until he reaches 100, and then he calls out:</p>

<blockquote>"Ready or not,<br />
You shall be caught."</blockquote>

<p>Each child having hidden in some place while he was
counting, remains perfectly still while he is hunting
for them. If he passes by some child without finding
him, that one can run to the "base" and
say "One, two, three, I'm in free!"
As many children as can try to get in "free,"
but if the one who is out tags any of them before they
reach "base," the first one tagged is
the next to hide his eyes.</p>

<a name="35"></a>
<h2>HANG-MAN.</h2>

<p>Two children may derive a great deal of amusement
from this simple pastime. At the top of a piece of
paper write all the letters of the alphabet. Underneath,
the child who has thought of a word or short sentence
puts a dash down for every letter contained in the
word thought of.</p>

<p>Suppose the words thought of were "Gamebook," it would be written
thus: --------</p>

<p>The other player asks if the word contains "a,"
and the other puts it in its proper place, crossing
the letter off of the alphabet above. The other guesses
different letters at random, every right one being
put in its place, while for every wrong one a line
is drawn to help construct a gallows for the "hang-man."
If there are many wrong guesses, the "hang-man"
may be completed and then the word is told the other
player. The players take turns in giving out and guessing
the words.</p>

<p>The gallows is made thus for every wrong guess:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="4.png" src="4.png" /></p>

<a name="36"></a>
<h2>BIRD, BEAST, OR FISH.</h2>

<p>A simple little game for amusing two children is the
following. Write on the top of a slate or paper the
words "Bird, beast, and fish."</p>

<p>One child thinks of the name of some animal and puts
down the first and last letters of the word, marking
dashes for the other letters. His companion thinks
over all the names of animals he knows containing
that number of letters, until finally he has guessed
what it is or else has given up. If he guesses correctly
it is his turn to give either a bird, beast, or fish.</p>

<a name="37"></a>
<h2>PETER PIPER.</h2>

<p>This is an amusing game for children. A blackboard
is needed upon which the verse, "Peter Piper,"
etc., is illustrated or written so that the words
are mixed up and it will be difficult to point out.
Some older person will be needed to superintend the
game.</p>

<p>One child is given a pointer and as the others sing,
to any familiar tune (Yankee Doodle, for instance):</p>

<blockquote>"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled
peppers,<br />
Now if Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled
peppers,<br />
Where is that peck of pickled peppers,<br />
Peter Piper picked?"</blockquote>

<p>she must point out each word or drawing as quickly
as it is sung.</p>

<p>If a mistake is made in pointing, the child takes
her place with the rest and another child is out.
Each one is given a turn.</p>

<p>It is an achievement, if done successfully, and some
suitable gift should be given as a prize.</p>

<a name="38"></a>
<h2>LOOK OUT FOR THE BEAR!</h2>

<p>Any number of children can play this game.  One is
chosen to be the "bear," and he hides
in some part of the room or garden, while the rest,
with their backs turned, are standing at their goal.</p>

<p>As soon as the children have counted 50 or 100, they
all scatter and hunt for the "bear."
The child who finds him first calls out, "Look
out for the bear," and all the children run to
their goal.</p>

<p>If the bear catches any while running for the goal,
they become "bears." These "bears"
hide together and the game continues until all the
children are "bears."</p>

<a name="39"></a>
<h2>HOOP RACE.</h2>

<p>All children love to roll hoops. For a little folks
party, plan to have as many hoops as children, so
each can have one.</p>

<p>Bind these around with tape or ribbon. The children
contest one at a time. The child who succeeds in rolling
his hoop around the room three times without having
it turn over or stop, wins the prize.</p>

<p>If the room is very large once or twice around will
be enough, so the children aren't tired out.</p>

<a name="40"></a>
<h2>BUTTON FUN.</h2>

<p>An amusement for small children, is to gather together
as many buttons of all shapes and sizes, plain and
fancy, as can be obtained.</p>

<p>The largest button is the father, the next size is
the mother, several children arranged according to
size, and a tiny one for the baby.</p>

<p>Plain buttons are called servants, others animals
and pets. The children arrange their families in pasteboard
boxes, using pasteboard cards for chairs, carriages,
etc. All children like to play "house,"
and a whole afternoon can be whiled away making stores
out of cards, to do shopping in, and boats for the
button-children to play in. "School" also
can be played and the boys enjoy forming rows of soldiers
and parading up and down.</p>

<a name="41"></a>
<h2>STEPS.</h2>

<p>One child is chosen out. This one stands by a post
or door with his back to the other players. The rest
of the children stand in a row at the other end of
the room or porch, as the case may be.</p>

<p>The one by the door counts 5, slowly or quickly, and
then turns around. While he is counting and his back
is turned, the others take as many steps forward as
they can without being caught. If anyone is moving
when the player turns around, they exchange places,
and the game continues, the children advancing step
by step toward the goal. When one has reached the
goal and touched it, he can go back again and begin
all over. The one who touches the goal the greatest
number of times just by stepping, and has not been
caught, wins the game.</p>

<a name="42"></a>
<h2>HE CAN DO LITTLE.</h2>

<p>All the players sit in a circle. One, knowing the
catch, begins by saying: "Ahem, he can do little
who cannot do this." While saying this, he taps
a stick on the floor several times.</p>

<p>This stick passes from one to the other in turn, each
one thinking that the stick must be tapped a certain
number of times, but the catch is that just before
saying "He can do little who cannot do this,"
each one ought to clear his throat as the leader did
at first.  Allow the game to continue around the circle
two or three times before explaining the catch.  A
forfeit is paid by each player who does not do it
correctly.</p>

<a name="43"></a>
<h2>WINK.</h2>

<p>All the girls sit in a circle, and the boys stand
outside, one boy behind each girl's chair. One
chair is left vacant, but a boy stands behind it,
and by winking at the girls one at a time, tries to
get one for his empty chair.</p>

<p>As soon as a girl is winked at, she tries to leave
her seat, and take the vacant one, but if the boy
behind her touches her before she leaves the seat,
she cannot go. Each boy has to keep his eye on the
one who is winking and on the girl in his chair, for
if he is not watching, she may escape before he has
time to touch her, and then it is his turn to do the
winking and get a girl for his chair.</p>

<p>If the winking is done quickly it adds to the interest
of the game. No boy can keep hold of a girl all the
time; he must only touch her when she starts to leave
her place, and then if she is beyond arm's length,
he cannot call her back.</p>

<a name="44"></a>
<h2>DOUBLE TAG.</h2>

<p>The children stand in pairs, one behind the other,
in the form of a circle, all facing the center.</p>

<p>Two of them are out, one who runs away, and the other
who tries to catch him. The one who is running away
may place himself in front of any couple for safety
and he cannot be tagged, but the child at the end
of the trio must run, and if he is caught before he
can stand in front of another couple, he is the catcher
and pursues the other child.</p>

<a name="45"></a>
<h2>PUSS IN THE CORNER.</h2>

<p>All the children except one stand in corners, or in
any fixed stations if there are not enough corners
to go around. The one who is out stands in the middle
to represent "Puss." The players then beckon
to each other one at a time saying, "Here, puss,
puss," and run and change places with the one
who is called.</p>

<p>Puss tries to get one of the vacant places.  If she
succeeds, the child who is left out is "Puss,"
until she manages to obtain a place.</p>

<a name="46"></a>
<h2>I HAVE A BASKET.</h2>

<p>One child begins by saying: "I have a basket."
The one to his left says: "What is in it?"
The first one replies with the name of some article
beginning with "a," as "apples."</p>

<p>No. 2 says: "I have a basket," and the
next one to him says: "What is in it?"
No. 2 replies: "Apples and bananas," (or
some other word beginning with "b").</p>

<p>No. 3 says: "I have a basket." No. 4 asks
the same question as before and No. 3 responds with
"Apples, bananas, and cats," and so on,
each in turn repeating what the others have said,
and adding another article, which commences with the
next letter of the alphabet. Whoever forgets what
the other articles were must pay a forfeit. Thus it
continues until the last one has named all the articles
in order, and ended with "z".</p>

<a name="47"></a>
<h2>STILL POND, NO MORE MOVING.</h2>

<p>All the children form a circle, joining hands.  One
is blindfolded, given a cane, and stands in the middle
of the circle.</p>

<p>The children march around her, going fast or slowly
until she taps on the floor three times with the cane
and says: "Still pond, no more moving."
The children drop hands, and remain perfectly still,
right where they are.</p>

<p>The one in the middle feels her way toward the children,
holding the cane in front of her.  The first child
who is touched with the cane must take hold of it.
The blindfolded one says, "Grunt like a pig,"
and the one holding the cane must grunt, disguising
her voice if possible. If the blindfolded one guesses
who she is, they exchange places, and the game goes
on as before, but if she fails, she has another turn
and may tell the player to "Bark like a dog"
or "Mew like a cat" until she guesses
the right one.</p>

<a name="48"></a>
<h2>RING ON A STRING.</h2>

<p>Slip a ring on a long piece of string having the ends
knotted together. The players stand in a circle and
the string passes through their closed hands. Each
makes the motions of passing something.</p>

<p>The ring circulates from one to another, while a player
in the middle tries to find it.  As soon as the ring
is found, the person in whose hands it was takes his
place, and the ring is passed as before.</p>

<a name="49"></a>
<h2>HUNT THE SLIPPER.</h2>

<p>All the children except one sit on the floor in a
circle, with their knees raised. The one left out
brings a slipper, and handing it to one child says:</p>

<blockquote>"Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe,<br />
Get it done by quarter-past two."</blockquote>

<p>He walks to the other side of the room and in a minute
comes back and asks if the shoe is done. In the meantime
the slipper is being passed from one to the other,
under their knees.</p>

<p>The child who is asked if the slipper is done says
she thinks her neighbor has it, the neighbor is asked
and receiving the same answer the one hunting it goes
from one to the other until the slipper is found.
If it takes too long for him to find it, the slipper
may be tossed across the circle, so it will be easy
to follow it up.</p>

<a name="50"></a>
<h2>WHAT IS MY THOUGHT LIKE?</h2>

<p>All the children except one sit in a circle.  This
one thinks of something and, standing in the middle
of the circle, asks each one in turn: "What
is my thought like?"</p>

<p>Each one names some object, and when all have been
asked, the leader announces what her thought was and
each in turn must prove the resemblance between his
answer and the thought. Whoever fails must pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>Suppose the thought is a stove, and No. 1 says: "Like
the sun." No. 2, "Like silver,"
then the second time around No. 1 can say: "A
stove is like the sun because they both give heat;"
No. 2 can say: "A stove is like silver because
they both shine when well polished," and so on.</p>

<a name="51"></a>
<h2>ORANGES AND LEMONS.</h2>

<p>The two tallest children, one named "Orange,"
the other "Lemon," join hands and form
an arch for the other children to pass under.  The
children, holding on to each other's dresses,
march in single file and sing:</p>

<blockquote>"'Oranges and lemons,'
say the bells of St. Clement's,<br />
'Brickbats and tiles,' say
the bells of St. Giles,<br />
'You owe me five farthing,'
say the bells of St. Martin's,<br />
'When will you pay me?' say
the bells of old Bailey,<br />
'When I grow rich,' say the
bells of Shoreditch,<br />
'When will that be?' say the
bells of Stepney,<br />
'I do not know,' says the
great bell of Bow.<br />
Here comes a candle to light you to bed,<br />
And here comes a chopper to chop off your
head."</blockquote>

<p>When the last line is sung the child who is under
their arms is caught and asked in a whisper if he
will be an orange or lemon. He answers, and joins
whichever side he chose, holding the other around the
waist. The game continues until all are caught, and
then there is a tug-of-war between the oranges and
lemons.</p>

<a name="52"></a>
<h2>RED-HOT POTATO.</h2>

<p>The "potato" in this game is a knotted
handkerchief.  One player is chosen for the center,
and the others sit around in a circle. The one in
the center throws the "potato" to anyone
in the circle. This one must throw it to another player
and so on, tossing it, from one to another, and never
allowing it to rest.</p>

<p>The player in the center tries to catch it.  If he
succeeds, the one who last tossed it exchanges places
with him, and the game goes on as before.</p>

<a name="53"></a>
<h2>JUDGE AND JURY.</h2>

<p>Arrange the children in two rows, facing each other.
The judge sits at one end in the aisle. He asks one
of the jury a question (anything he happens to think
of). The one who is questioned must not answer, but
the child sitting opposite him must reply for him,
being careful not to use any of the following words
in his answer. Yes, no, black, or white.  Some answer
must be given, whether it be sensible, or not.</p>

<p>Whoever fails to answer before the judge counts 10,
or answers out of turn, or uses any of the forbidden
words must either pay a forfeit or become the judge.</p>

<a name="54"></a>
<h2>REUBEN AND RACHEL.</h2>

<p>Blindfold one of the players. All the rest form a
ring and dance around him until he points at some
one. That one enters the ring and the blindman calls
out: "Rachel;" she answers: "Here,
Reuben," and moves about in the circle so as
to escape being caught by "Reuben."</p>

<p>Every time the blindman calls out "Rachel,"
she must reply with "Reuben" and thus
it goes until finally "Rachel" is caught.
"Reuben" must guess who she is, and if
he guesses correctly, "Rachel" is blindfolded
and the game goes on as before. If not, the same child
is "Reuben" again.</p>

<a name="55"></a>
<h2>FROG IN THE MIDDLE.</h2>

<p>The children form a ring. One, the frog, is chosen
out, and he stands in the middle of the circle.</p>

<p>The children, holding hands, dance around him, saying:
"Frog in the middle, jump in, jump out, take
a stick and poke him out." As the last line
is sung, the frog takes one child by the hands and
pulls him to the center, exchanging places with him.
The children continue dancing around and singing while
the frogs jump thick and fast. The game continues
until all have been frogs or are tired out.</p>

<a name="56"></a>
<h2>HORSEMEN.</h2>

<p>This is a rough-and-tumble game for the boys, and
must be played either outside, or in a large bare
room.</p>

<p>Sides are chosen, the big boys taking the small boys
on their back, carrying them "pick-a-back."
 The one carrying the boy is called the horse, and
the other the rider. The sides stand opposite each
other and when a signal is given, they rush toward
each other, the horses trying to knock down the opposing
horses, and the riders trying to dismount each other.</p>

<p>The game continues until a single horse and rider
remain, and the side to which they belong wins the
game.</p>

<a name="57"></a>
<h2>MY HOUSE, YOUR HOUSE.</h2>

<p>Attach a string to the end of a small stick.  At the
end of the string make a loop that will slip very
easily. On a table make a circle with chalk.</p>

<p>The leader, or fisherman, arranges the loop around
the circle and holds the stick in his hand. Whenever
he says: "My house," each player must
put his first finger inside the circle, and leave it
there. When "Your house" is said, the
fingers must be withdrawn.</p>

<p>The commands must be given very quickly, and the fisherman
must be quick to jerk his rod, thus catching several
fingers.</p>

<p>A forfeit should be paid by everyone who is caught,
and the fisherman can exchange places if he wishes.</p>

<a name="58"></a>
<h2>MALAGA GRAPES.</h2>

<p>All the players sit in a circle and one who knows
the trick takes a small cane in his right hand; then,
taking it in his left hand, he passes it to his neighbor,
saying: "Malaga grapes are very good grapes;
the best to be had in the market." He tells his
neighbor to do the same.</p>

<p>Thus the cane passes from one to the other, each one
telling about the grapes; but if any should pass the
stick with the right hand, a forfeit must be paid.
The trick must not be told until it has gone around
the circle once or twice.</p>

<h1>Part II.</h1>

<h3>Games for Adults.</h3>

<a name="59"></a>
<h2>SPOON PICTURES.</h2>

<p>It will be necessary for two of the players to know
how to play the game. One is sent out of the room,
and the other remains inside to take a picture of
one of the guests. This is done by holding up a spoon
or some polished surface to a player's face.</p>

<p>When the picture is taken, the one outside is called
in, given the spoon, told to look at it, and guess
whose picture it is. In a short time she has guessed
correctly, to the amazement of the guests. She leaves
the room again, while another picture is taken, is
called in, and guesses that, and so on.</p>

<p>If any guest thinks he can do it, he may have a trial,
but he may fail. Finally it is discovered that the
one who remained inside and took the pictures sits
in exactly the same position as the person whose picture
was taken.  If his feet were crossed and his hands
folded, the leader will take that position. If another
person is in that position, the one who guesses waits
until one makes a change, and thus the name may be
guessed.</p>

<a name="60"></a>
<h2>BOOTS, WITHOUT SHOES.</h2>

<p>All the players are sent out of the room.  The leader
remains inside and calls one player in. They both
sit down together and the leader says: "Say
just what I say. Say boots, without shoes." (With
a short pause after boots.) The victim may repeat
the whole sentence and the leader says, "No,
I want you to say boots, without shoes," and
thus it may go on until the leader has given the simple
statement in all sorts of tones and expressions, and
finally, the player realizes that when told to say
"Boots, without shoes," she must simply
say "Boots."</p>

<p>Each player in turn is called in and put through the
ordeal, affording much amusement for those already
in the room, until all have guessed it and laughed
over it.</p>

<a name="61"></a>
<h2>PROVERBS.</h2>

<p>Any number of persons may play this game.  One is
sent out of the room while the rest choose some proverb.
Then he is called in and asks each player in turn
a question. In the answer, no matter what the question
is, one word of the proverb must be given.</p>

<p>Suppose the proverb "Make hay while the sun
shines" is taken, then player No. 1 would have
"Make"; No. 2, "hay"; No. 3,
"while"; No. 4, "the"; No.
5, "sun"; No. 6, "shines";
No. 7, "make"; etc., giving each
player a word, often repeating the proverb several
times.</p>

<p>The answers to the questions must be given quickly,
and no special word emphasized.  Often the one guessing
will have to go around several times before he can
discover any word which will reveal the proverb. The
one whose answer gave the clue must leave the room
next, and it becomes his turn to guess.</p>

<a name="62"></a>
<h2>ANIMAL, VEGETABLE, OR MINERAL.</h2>

<p>When the party is large, this game affords much amusement.
One player is sent out of the room. While he is gone
the players decide upon some object which he is to
guess.  He is then called in, and asks each one a
question.</p>

<p>The answers to the questions must be either "Yes"
or "No," and a forfeit must be paid if
any other answer is given.</p>

<p>Suppose the object chosen is a piece of coal in the
fireplace. The player will begin by finding out whether
the object chosen is of the animal, vegetable, or
mineral kingdom; thus the following questions may
be asked: "Is it a mineral?" "Yes."
"Is it hard?" "Yes."  "Is
it very valuable?" "No." "Is
it bright and shiny?" "Yes." "Is
it gold?" "No." "Silver?"
 "No." "Is it in this room?"
"Yes." "Is it black?" "Yes."
"Is it a piece of coal?" "Yes."</p>

<p>The correct object being guessed, another player is
sent out and the game continues.</p>

<a name="63"></a>
<h2>WHAT TIME IS IT?</h2>

<p>It requires two players who understand this game,
a leader and his accomplice. The accomplice leaves
the room, while the leader and the rest remain inside.
The leader asks the players what hour they will choose
for the accomplice to guess. One will say: "Four
o'clock." The assistant is called in and
he questions the leader, saying: "Well, what
time is it?" The leader answers thus: "Don't
you know?"; next, "Doubtless, dancing
time."  The assistant immediately answers "Four
o'clock," to the amazement of the company.</p>

<p>The key is that each hour, from 1 to 12 o'clock
has been named according to the letters of the alphabet
in rotation, from A to K, The leader, in answering,
must be very careful to begin each answer with the
letter indicating the chosen hour; thus in the above
the assistant noticed that each answer began with
"d," and "d" being the fourth
letter, four o'clock was the time chosen. Only
the exact hours must be chosen. As the different players
think they understand the game, they may take the
assistant's place, and many ludicrous mistakes
will be the result until the game has been explained
to all.</p>

<a name="64"></a>
<h2>IT.</h2>

<p>One of the players who does not know the game is sent
out of the room. While he is gone, the others are
supposed to be thinking of some person whom he is
to guess when he comes in, but it is arranged that
each one describes his right hand neighbor when asked
any questions. It is more amusing if the circle is
composed of boys and girls alternating.</p>

<p>The player is called in, having been told beforehand
that he is to guess what person the company thought
of and that that person is "It."</p>

<p>He begins by asking "Is it in this room?"
 "Yes." "Is it a boy?" "Yes."
"Is his hair long or short?" "Very
long," and so on, until the information he has
obtained may be the following: "A boy, very long
hair, pink waist, blue eyes, has a beard, very stout,
about 6 feet tall, about 8 years old." The player,
astonished at such information, may keep up guessing,
until, by closely questioning each one, he guesses
correctly. If he cannot guess, it is explained to him
who "It" is.</p>

<a name="65"></a>
<h2>HOW, WHEN, WHERE.</h2>

<p>One of the players leaves the room while the others
select some word with two or three meanings, which
is to be guessed. Suppose the word "trunk"
is thought of. When the player is summoned in he asks
each one in turn "How do you like it?"
The answers may be "full of clothes,"
"when the outside is brown," (meaning a
tree trunk), "shut up in a cage," (referring
to an elephant's trunk).</p>

<p>The next time around the question is "When do
you like it?" and the answers may be, "When
I'm going away," "When I'm
in the country," "When I visit the Zoo."</p>

<p>The last question is "Where do you like it?"
 and the answers may be "In my room,"
"In the woods," "On the animal it
belongs to."  The questioner must try to guess
the word from the various answers. If he succeeds,
the person whose answer revealed the word must leave
the room, but if he fails, he has to guess again.</p>

<a name="66"></a>
<h2>BUZ.</h2>

<p>All the players sit in a circle and begin to count
in turn, but whenever seven, or any multiple of seven
comes, "Buz" is said in its place.  If
anyone forgets he may be put out and the game commenced
over again, but it is more fun if the players go right
on with the counting, as many will fall off when the
count is up in the hundreds. The game may be continued
as long as is desired.</p>

<p>Suppose the players have counted up to twenty, the
next one would say "Buz," as twenty-one
is a multiple of seven; the next, "twenty-two,"
the next "twenty-three," and so on.  The
one having "twenty-seven" would say "Buz,"
as it contains seven. When seventy is reached, the
numbers are said, "Buz one," "Buz
two," etc.; "double Buz," for
seventy-seven, and so on.</p>

<p>"Siz" may be substituted for six and its
multiples, and "Fiz" for five, just for
variety.</p>

<a name="67"></a>
<h2>JENKINS UP!</h2>

<p>Divide the company into two sides. One division sits
around the table on one side, the other on the opposite
side. The members of division "A" put
their hands under the table and a small coin, dime
or quarter, is passed from one to the other.</p>

<p>When division "B" thinks they have had
enough time, the players call out, "Jenkins
up!" and the players of "A" hold
up their closed hands, and when "Jenkins down!"
is called, they must place their hands, palm down,
on the table. The players of "B" must guess
under which palm the coin is. Each player has one
guess, those on the opposite side raising their hands
when requested to do so.</p>

<p>If "B" guesses correctly, the coin is
passed over to them and "A" must guess
who has it, but if not, "A" keeps the coin,
and "B" has another trial for guessing.</p>

<p>Tally may be kept, 1 being counted for every correct
guess, and a certain number, as 50, may be the limit.
The side gaining 50 points first is victorious.</p>

<a name="68"></a>
<h2>STATE OUTLINES.</h2>

<p>This is a splendid game for the beginning of an evening
as the guests mingle together and become acquainted
while hunting for their partners.</p>

<p>The hostess prepares pieces of cardboard on which
she has drawn the outline of a state without the name.
The state capitals are written on separate pieces
of paper. The cards and slips are handed out haphazard
as the guests arrive.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to find the state to which
the capital belongs or vice versa, as the case may
be.</p>

<p>The one who succeeds in locating his capital first
is the winner.</p>

<p>The hostess can arrange for the length of time.</p>

<a name="69"></a>
<h2>PREFIXES.</h2>

<p>One of the players is sent out of the room.  The others
then decide upon some word which he is to guess when
he returns. He is told what the prefix of the word
is, and must guess, by asking questions, what the
rest of the word is. The players answer his questions
by their manner or actions.</p>

<p>Suppose the word chosen is "encouraged,"
the answers may be given in a cheerful way.</p>

<p>The player who is guessing may think of any number
of words with the prefix "en," but he
must continue asking questions until the right word
has been guessed.</p>

<p>The player who has revealed the word by his or her
actions, takes the other's place and leaves
the room while the rest are deciding upon some word
for him to guess.  The game continues as before.</p>

<a name="70"></a>
<h2>MY FATHER HAD A ROOSTER!</h2>

<p>All the players sit in a circle, the leader begins
by saying, "My father had a rooster!"
 The player to his left says: "A what?"
 The leader answers: "A rooster!" Each
player repeats this in turn to his left-hand neighbor
who asks the question, until it is the leader's
turn again.</p>

<p>He then repeats the first part and asks the player
next to him, "Could he crow?" The player
answers, "Crow he could." This is repeated
by each player with the previous questions.  The next
time the leader says "How could he crow?"
The player on the left answers "Cock-a-doodle-doo!"
This goes around the circle again and when the last
one has taken part, all together say "Cock-a-doodle-doo,"
as a finish.</p>

<p>No one is supposed to laugh during the whole game,
whoever does, may either pay a forfeit or is out of
the game. It is best to have a person who knows the
game sit next to the leader, so they can start the
game correctly.  The complete statements are these,</p>

<blockquote>"My father had a rooster!"<br />
"A what?"<br />
"A rooster!"<br />
"Could he crow?"<br />
"Crow he could!"<br />
"How could he crow?"<br />
"Cock-a-doodle-doo!"</blockquote>

<a name="71"></a>
<h2>CROSS QUESTIONS AND CROOKED ANSWERS.</h2>

<p>All sit in a circle for this game. The first one begins
by whispering some question to his left hand neighbor,
such as "Do you like apples?" The second
player must remember the question asked him, and he
answers No. 1 by saying, "Yes, the nice, red,
juicy kind." This answer belongs to No. 1 and
he must remember it. No. 2 asks No. 3 a question, being
careful to remember his answer, as it belongs to him.
Suppose he asks, "Are you fond of books?"
and the answer is "Yes, I read every one that
comes out." Thus No. 2 has a question and answer
that belong to him.</p>

<p>Every one in turn asks a question and gives an answer,
remembering the question he was asked and the answer
his neighbor gave him, which belong to him. When all
have had a turn, No. 2 begins by saying aloud: "I
was asked: 'Do you like cats?' and the
answer was 'Yes, the nice, red juicy kind';"
No. 2 says: "I was asked, 'Do you like
apples?'  and the answer was, 'Yes, I
read every one that comes out,'" and so
on.</p>

<a name="72"></a>
<h2>MAGIC WRITING.</h2>

<p>An assistant is necessary for this game. One gives
a little talk about sign-language and says that he
can read any sign made with a stick on the floor,
and will leave the room while the others decide upon
some word for him to guess.</p>

<p>Beforehand, it has been agreed upon between the leader
and his assistant that one tap of the stick on the
floor will represent "a"; two taps, "e";
three taps, "i"; four taps, "o";
five taps, "u." Thus all the vowels are
indicated by taps, and the consonants, by having the
first word of the sentence which the leader gives begin
with the chosen letter. The letters of the chosen
word must be given in order.</p>

<p>The leader, who remains inside, knows the chosen word,
and when the assistant is called in, he makes many
signs with the stick, tapping in the proper places.</p>

<p>Suppose the word chosen is "Games." When
the assistant is called in, the leader begins by making
many scrolls, etc., on the floor, then says:
"Great fun, isn't it?" (initial letter
"g"), then one tap, "a"; "Many
don't know what I'm writing." (initial
letter "m"); 2 taps, "e"; "Sometimes
it is hard to read." (initial letter "s").
Then a few more marks, so as not to end too abruptly,
and the assistant says "Games," to the
astonishment of the company.</p>

<p>This is continued until some have guessed, or until
the trick has been explained.</p>

<a name="73"></a>
<h2>FAMOUS NUMBERS.</h2>

<p>Provide the players with pencil and paper.  Each one
writes a number on his slip. The papers are collected,
mixed up, and each player draws one. Each in turn
must name something or someone suggested by that number.
 The one who is unable to name anything must pay a
forfeit.</p>

<p>Suppose No. 1 has 4, he will say: "My number
is 4; the Declaration of Independence was signed on
the Fourth of July." No. 2, "My number
is 13; there are thirteen stripes in our flag."
No. 3, "My number is 60; there are 60 minutes
in an hour."</p>

<a name="74"></a>
<h2>MAGIC ANSWERS.</h2>

<p>One is sent from the room and the others decide upon
some object which is to be guessed when the player
enters.</p>

<p>The player outside has an accomplice in with the others
who asks the question when he returns. It was arranged
between them that the object chosen should be named
after some four-legged thing.</p>

<p>Suppose a book is chosen by the players.  When summoned
in, the accomplice asks: "Is it any one in this
room?" "No." "Is it a handkerchief?"
 "No." "Is it a picture?" "No."
 "Is it a dog?" "No." "Is
it this book?"  "Yes."</p>

<p>Another arrangement is to have the correct object
mentioned after something which is black, such as
shoes, ink, etc.</p>

<a name="75"></a>
<h2>MODELLING.</h2>

<p>Provide each player with a card and a toothpick, also
a piece of gum, or paraffine if preferred.</p>

<p>The hostess announces that when she says "Ready,"
the gum is to be chewed until she tells them to stop,
and then each one is to take the gum, place it upon
the card, and with the aid of the toothpick, model
either an animal or a flower, keeping his selection
a secret, as each one can choose what he wishes to
model. The hostess keeps an eye on the time and when
time is up, (any length she chooses) all the cards
are collected and placed on a table for exhibition.</p>

<p>There is a curious mixture of cows, cats, dogs, sunflowers,
pansies, violets, etc. Vote is taken upon the
best model and a prize is awarded the victor.</p>

<a name="76"></a>
<h2>SCISSORS CROSSED OR UNCROSSED.</h2>

<p>A simple catch game is as follows. It is best if two
of the company know how to play it. One of the two
is the leader and the other helps her out.</p>

<p>The leader hands a closed pair of scissors to her
accomplice, who takes it and says: "I received
these scissors uncrossed and I give them crossed."
(Opening the scissors as she speaks.) She passes them
to the player on her right who should say: "I
receive these scissors crossed and I give them crossed."
(If they are left open; if closed, they are uncrossed.)
 Those who do not know the game receive the scissors
and pass them and say what they think they ought. It
may be just what the player before said, but the condition
of the scissors may not be the same, and, therefore,
it is not right.</p>

<p>Thus each one has a turn, and the game continues until
some bright player notices that the scissors are called
crossed when they are open and uncrossed when they
are closed, and that the player who knows the game
crossed her feet if the scissors were crossed, and
if not, her feet were uncrossed, or resting on the
floor as usual.</p>

<p>Thus the object of the game is to change the words
and the position of the feet in accordance with the
position of the scissors.</p>

<a name="77"></a>
<h2>CAPPING VERSES.</h2>

<p>To while away the time before dinner, or while sitting
in the twilight, this is a simple amusement for those
who love poetry.</p>

<p>One begins by giving a line or verse of poetry. The
next one continues, but his verse must commence with
the last letter of the previous verse, and so on,
each one capping the other's verse.</p>

<p>Suppose No.1 quotes:</p>

<blockquote>"Full many a flower is born to blush
unseen<br />
And waste its sweetness on the desert
air."</blockquote>

<p>No. 2 continues quoting:</p>

<blockquote>"Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?"</blockquote>

<p>No. 3:</p>

<blockquote>"O speak again, bright angel."</blockquote>

<p>No. 4:</p>

<blockquote>"Like summer tempest came her tears,<br />
'Sweet, my child, I live for thee.'"</blockquote>

<p>and so on until the guests tire of it.</p>

<a name="78"></a>
<h2>RABBIT.</h2>

<p>The leader, who knows the game, asks each one in turn:
"Do you know how to play rabbit?"  When
all have answered, he says: "Do just what I
do, and I will show you how."</p>

<p>1st. All stand in a row.</p>

<p>2d. All kneel down on one knee.</p>

<p>3d. All place the first finger of the right hand on
the floor.</p>

<p>When all the players are in this position, just as
they are losing their balance, the leader, who is
at the head of the line, pushes against the player
next to him, thus knocking over the whole row. As
they fall amid laughter, he calmly announces that that
is the way to play rabbit.</p>

<a name="79"></a>
<h2>GHOST.</h2>

<p>Turn down the lights. All the players sit in a circle.
The leader has a button which she gives to some player,
as in "Button, button, who has the button?"
The one who guesses who has the button takes the leader's
place while the leader becomes a ghost and remains
outside the circle. She can talk to the players in
the circle, but no one except the one in the middle
can answer her. Anyone who does, becomes a ghost with
the leader.</p>

<p>Every effort is made on the part of the ghosts to
induce the players to answer. The button keeps going
around the inside circle, the one depositing the button
becoming a ghost when a correct answer is given and
the other one taking his place.</p>

<p>The game continues until all are ghosts. If there
was one who was not enticed, that one wins the game.</p>

<a name="80"></a>
<h2>WHAT AM I?</h2>

<p>One of the players is sent out of the room.  The rest
decide upon the name of some animal which he is to
guess.</p>

<p>When he returns the players question him in turn,
imitating the habits of the animal chosen and asking
questions as if he were that animal.</p>

<p>For instance, the animal chosen is tiger. The questions
may be, "Do you scratch?" "Are your
claws sharp?" "Do you howl at night?"
etc. The player thinking they have named him a
cat answers, "Yes," and says, "Am
I a cat?" When answered in the negative, the
players still question him until he finally guesses
tiger. The player whose question betrayed the name
of the chosen animal then takes his place and the
game continues as before.</p>

<a name="81"></a>
<h2>NEEDLE THREADING.</h2>

<p>Procure several large jars. Stand these on their sides.
Only men can contest for this, as ladies are supposed
to be expert needle-threaders.</p>

<p>Four or five men contest at a time. Each sits on a
jar with his feet crossed in front. The leader hands
each a needle and thread. Allow five minutes for the
contest.</p>

<p>The jars, being on their sides, will roll around,
and as the contestants have their feet crossed, it
is a difficult task to remain still long enough to
thread the needle. Those who succeed deserve some
sort of prize.</p>

<a name="82"></a>
<h2>CONFUSIONS.</h2>

<p>The players are provided with pencil and paper. Each
player selects the name of some animal, fish, or bird,
and mixes the letters so as to spell other words.
For instance, if one chooses elephant, the words might
be "pent heal"; if monkey, "o my
ken," while mackerel may be "mere lack."</p>

<p>Allow five minutes for making the "confusion,"
no letter can be used twice, and words must be formed.
Then the hostess rings the bell and each player in
turn reads his "confusion" to the rest
who guess what his chosen word is. Each puzzle is
carefully timed. The one whose puzzle takes longest
to guess is the winner, therefore, each person must
mix the letters as much as possible.</p>

<p>Sides may be chosen if preferred, the players taking
turn alternately, the side which has taken the least
time to guess the puzzles is the victorious side.</p>

<a name="83"></a>
<h2>VERBAL AUTHORS.</h2>

<p>The players sit in a circle. One is chosen as judge
and he keeps tally. Each player in turn, rises, and
names some well-known book. The first one to call
out the name of the author scores a point. The game
continues until the interest ceases or the store of
literary knowledge is exhausted. The player having
the most points is the winner.</p>

<p>This game may be played in another way.  Instead of
calling out the author as the book is named, provide
each guest with pencil and paper and announce that
as a book is named, each player must write down the
author and the name of some character in that book.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Taming of the Shrew"--<br />
Wm. Shakespeare--Petruchio.</p>

<p>"Nicholas Nickleby"--<br />
Chas. Dickens--Mr. Squeers.</p>

<p>"Ivanhoe"--<br />
Sir Walter Scott--Rebecca.</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="84"></a>
<h2>PIN DOLL BABIES.</h2>

<p>Any number may play this game. If there are men and
women it is more amusing.</p>

<p>Divide the company into groups of five or six. Each
group sits around a table upon which are pins, needles
and thread, scissors, for each player but no thimbles,
and strips of tissue paper, colored and white.</p>

<p>The hostess hands each guest a large wooden clothes-pin
which is to be dressed as a doll, using the tissue
paper for dresses and hats.</p>

<p>All begin to work at a given signal and the hostess
allows a certain length of time for the dressmaking.
There is much merriment, as it is nearly as awkward
for the ladies to sew without a thimble as it is for
the men to use a needle.</p>

<p>When the time is up, these doll-babies are arranged
in line for inspection. Two judges are appointed to
decide upon the best and the worst. Prizes are awarded.</p>

<a name="85"></a>
<h2>BUILDING SENTENCES.</h2>

<p>The hostess begins by saying one word and announces
that each word of the sentence must begin with the
initial letter of the given word. The player to her
right gives the second word, the next player, the third,
and so on, until the sentence is complete only when
it reaches the hostess.</p>

<p>Each player must be careful not to give a word which
with the others completes the sentence, as the hostess
is the only one who is supposed to finish it--but
sometimes it seems as though all the words of that
letter have been taken; if this is the case, the player
who finished the sentence must pay a forfeit or drop
out of the game.</p>

<p>Suppose there are nine players and number one says
"An," number two "Angry,"
number three "Ape," number four "Ate,"
number five "Apples"; thus number five
is out or pays a forfeit as the sentence is completed
and there are still four more to play. Thus the sentence
might have been "An angry ape ate attractive,
audacious, ancient April apples."</p>

<p>This sentence is absurd, but the more ridiculous,
the greater the fun.</p>

<p>For the second turn the player to the right of the
hostess begins, using a word beginning with another
letter and so on, until each player has started a
sentence.</p>

<h2>GEOGRAPHY.</h2>

<p>Select two leaders from the company. Each leader chooses
players for his side. The sides stand opposite each
other. One leader begins by giving the name of some
river, mountain, lake, city or town, state or country,
located in any part of the world, that begins with
the letter A, the other leader answers back with another
geographical name commencing with A. The two leaders
continue with the letter A until they can think of
no more names, then, they commence with B, and so
on, until every letter of the alphabet has been used.</p>

<p>The players on the opposite sides simply help their
leader with the names, as soon as one thinks of a
name it is passed up to the leader to help him. No
place can be named twice. The side that stands up the
longest wins.</p>

<p>Another way to play this game is as follows.  Having
chosen the sides as before, one leader begins by naming
any place, lake, river, etc., commencing with
any letter; the leader on the other side then follows
with a name commencing with the last letter of the
previous name; then the player next to the leader
on the opposite side follows with a name commencing
with the last letter of that name and so on, each player
has a turn as it goes from side to side. Suppose the
leader names Washington, the next New York, and so
on. Thirty seconds is allowed to think of a name,
if he fails in that, he must drop out. Any one may
be challenged to locate the place which he has named.
The side which has kept up the longest, is the champion.</p>

<a name="87"></a>
<h2>WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF--?</h2>

<p>Predicaments of the worst kind are thought of and
written on pieces of paper. These are handed among
the guests, who write out an answer, telling the best
way out of the difficulty. Each question begins with
"What would you do if--?"</p>

<p>When all have written their answers, the papers are
collected in a basket, mixed up, and each one draws
one out. The answers are then read aloud.</p>

<p>Examples: What would you do if you fell into a tar
barrel? I would be too stuck up to do anything.</p>

<p>What would you do if you should meet a footpad? I
would say, "Please, sir, go away."</p>

<a name="88"></a>
<h2>WATCH TRICK.</h2>

<p>It will require two people who know this game to be
in the secret. One of them leaves the room while his
confederate remains inside with the others. He hides
an article which the rest of the players have selected,
in an adjoining room which is totally dark, placing
a watch with a moderately loud tick, either on, or
as near to the hidden object as he can. The rest of
the players must not know anything about the watch,
as they are kept guessing how the player who is out,
succeeds in finding the hidden article in the dark
room.</p>

<p>When everything is ready, the one outside is called
in, led into the dark room, and hunts for the object.
The rest must remain very quiet, as it breaks the
"charm," so the leader says. Guided by
the ticking of the watch, and knowing that it is there,
he soon discovers the hidden object to the surprise
of the others.</p>

<p>He and his confederate may take turns going out and
after a while, if the company are very quiet, one
of them might hear the watch ticking and the trick
is disclosed.</p>

<a name="89"></a>
<h2>FIND YOUR BETTER-HALF.</h2>

<p>Select a number of pictures of men and women from
fashion papers, advertising books, etc. If possible,
try to procure them in pairs, that is, a man and woman
contained in the same picture, or two having the same
expression.  Number the pictures in pairs, thus there
will be two of No. 1, of No. 2, No. 3, etc.</p>

<p>Give the young ladies the pictures of the men and
the young men those of the ladies.  Each one then
hunts for his partner or "better-half,"
comparing the pictures and number.</p>

<p>The more mixed the pictures were when given out, the
longer it will take to find partners.</p>

<a name="90"></a>
<h2>WORDS</h2>

<p>The players form a line as in a spelling match. Sides
may be chosen if preferred. The first one begins by
giving the first letter of a word, "A"
for instance, thinking of the word "Animal."
The next player, thinking of "animate,"
says, "n." The next, thinking of "antidote,"
says "t," but this with the other letters
spells "ant," so he must go to the foot
of the line.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to keep from adding a letter
which finishes the word.  Often one will give a letter,
when thinking of another word, which will complete
a word.  If he does not notice his mistake, the others
call out "foot."</p>

<a name="91"></a>
<h2>LETTERS.</h2>

<p>Empty the contents of a box of "anagrams"
on a table so all the letters are in a pile face downward.
The players sit around the table.</p>

<p>The leader begins by turning up one of the letters
and says, "Bird." The players all see
the letter, and the first one who responds with the
name of a bird commencing with that letter is given
the card, and then it is his turn to turn up a card,
calling out "Bird," "Animal,"
"Fish," or "Famous Man," or
anything he wishes. Suppose the first letter was "E,"
and a player answered it with "Eagle";
the next letter was "G," and "Famous
Man" was called out, someone would say "Grant."</p>

<p>The one who has answered the most, thus obtaining
the greatest number of cards, is the winner.</p>

<a name="92"></a>
<h2>SEEING AND REMEMBERING.</h2>

<p>Fill a table with all sorts of things, books, gloves,
dolls, pins, scissors, food, some large, striking
picture, another very small object.  Keep the table
covered until ready for use.</p>

<p>Then remove the cover and let all the guests march
around it three times, touching nothing on it, simply
looking. The cover is replaced and each one is given
a pencil and paper on which he writes down as many
things as he can remember were on the table.</p>

<p>The one who has the largest list of correct names
receives a prize. The objects may be auctioned off
afterwards.</p>

<a name="93"></a>
<h2>LIVE TIT-TAT-TO.</h2>

<p>On a sheet mark a regular tit-tat-to diagram in black
point. Stretch the sheet so it will be smooth on the
floor. Divide the company into sides, a captain being
appointed for each side.  Call one side the crosses
and the other side the zeros.</p>

<p>When a signal is given, the captain of one side takes
his position in any one of the squares of the diagram.
The captain of the other side follows, taking his
position, then a player of the first side takes his
position endeavoring to be in a row with the first
move, so the next player on his side will form the
third cross or zero, as the case may be, in the row,
either straight or diagonally, and win the game for
that side.</p>

<p>The winning side then changes to zeros if they were
crosses or vice versa. Let each player have a turn,
as there are only nine squares, and as the game may
be won before they are all filled, some may not have
a chance to play. It is best, when playing a new game,
to let those who did not play before have first play.</p>

<a name="94"></a>
<h2>BITS OF ADVICE.</h2>

<p>Each person is given a slip of paper and pencil.
The leader then tells the players to write a bit of
advice, original if possible, on the paper, fold it,
and drop it into a basket as it passes by.</p>

<p>The papers are all mixed up and the basket is passed
again, each player taking one, but not unfolding it
until he is told to.</p>

<p>Before opening the papers each one must say whether
the advice is good or bad, necessary or unnecessary,
and whether he intends to follow it. When the paper
is unfolded it may be the opposite of what he has
said.</p>

<a name="95"></a>
<h2>PICTURES.</h2>

<p>Provide the players with pencil and paper.  All sit
in a circle. The leader announces that pictures are
to be drawn in this manner. First, draw a head (either
animal or human), fold the paper, pass it to the right.</p>

<p>Second--Draw a neck, shoulders, and arms.</p>

<p>Third--Complete the body (the former player
having left two lines below the fold of the paper).</p>

<p>Fourth--The skirt, trousers or legs, as
the case may be.</p>

<p>Fifth--The feet, and if you wish to add
to the fun, the last one writes a name either of some
one present or some noted person.</p>

<p>The papers are folded and passed after each drawing
and the last time, they are all opened and passed
around to be inspected and laughed over.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="5.png" src="5.png" /></p>

<a name="96"></a>
<h2>HOUSEHOLD GOSSIP.</h2>

<p>One of the guests is sent out of the room.  The hostess
asks the remaining players to say something about
him. As each one in turn gives his statement, she
writes it down with the person's name on a piece
of paper which she keeps.</p>

<p>The player is then summoned in and she reads the statements
about him one at a time and he must try to guess who
said it. As soon as he guesses one correctly, the
one who said it must go out of the room and the game
goes on as before.</p>

<p>Examples--</p>

<p>You have the family eyes.</p>

<p>Your chin is too small.</p>

<p>The left sleeve of your coat has a spot on it; and
so on.</p>

<a name="97"></a>
<h2>TABLE FOOTBALL.</h2>

<p>The "football" for this game is an eggshell
which has had the egg blown out of it. The players
sit around the table with their captains, who have
been previously chosen at each end. There need not
be just eleven on each side as in a regular game,
but any number.  Each captain chooses his side.</p>

<p>Boundaries are marked on the table with, chalk or
tape, the two ends being the goals.</p>

<p>When all are ready, the eggshell is placed in the
middle of the table, a signal is given, and the members
of each team blow the shell towards his goal. No player
can leave his place, and the "football"
must be moved entirely by blowing.</p>

<p>Regular football rules are used and the count is the
same as in football. It will add to the interest,
if the two teams stand for rival colleges.</p>

<a name="98"></a>
<h2>MUSICAL MEDLEY.</h2>

<p>Number eight slips of paper with the same number.
On each slip write a part, or a line from a verse
of a familiar song. Suppose set No. 1 was a verse
of "America," this is the way it would
be written.</p>

<blockquote>1. My country,<br />
1. 'Tis of thee,<br />
1. Sweet land of liberty,<br />
1. Of thee I sing;<br />
1. Land where my fathers died,<br />
1. Land of the pilgrim's pride,<br />
1. From every mountain side,<br />
1. Let freedom ring.</blockquote>

<p>Prepare as many slips in groups of eight as there
are guests. Give each one a slip at random and tell
each to find the rest of his set.</p>

<p>When the players of one group have found each other,
they stand together in one corner of the room and
practise their song. Each group does this until all
the groups are formed, and then, commencing with No.
1, each group in turn sings its song aloud for the
benefit of the audience.</p>

<a name="99"></a>
<h2>ANOTHER MUSICAL MEDLEY.</h2>

<p>Provide each player with pencil and paper.  Before
playing this game it must be arranged with someone
who plays the piano well to have a list of popular
songs ready, which she must play one right after the
other.</p>

<p>When the leader gives a signal, the pianist strikes
up a tune and continues playing from a part of one
song into another until she has reached the end of
her list.</p>

<p>The others write down on their papers the names of
the songs as fast as they are played, and when the
pianist stops, the correct list is read by her, and
the rest check off their lists.  Prizes may be awarded.
It is a strange fact, that after such a medley, there
will be very few, if any, who have correct lists.</p>

<a name="100"></a>
<h2>PASSING CLOTHESPINS.</h2>

<p>Sides are chosen among the players. Each side then
takes its position, forming a row on the floor, the
leader at the end. The sides face each other, but
quite a space is left between them.</p>

<p>At the head of each line is placed a basket containing
twelve clothespins. Each player is instructed to hold
his neighbor's right wrist with his left hand,
thus leaving one hand (the right one), free.</p>

<p>The leaders begin by passing the clothespins, one
at a time, down the line, each player being careful
not to drop one. When one reaches the end of the line,
the last player places it on the floor beside him
until all twelve have been passed, then he passes them,
the same as before, up the line to the leader.</p>

<p>The side which succeeds in passing all its clothespin
back to its leader first is the victorious side. It
is best to have a trial game first, so that the players
may become used to passing with one hand, thus being
able to do it rapidly for the regular game.</p>

<p>If a clothespin is dropped, the player who dropped
it must pick it up and pass it on. The rest must wait
until it is passed before passing any of the others.</p>

<a name="101"></a>
<h2>PANTOMIME.</h2>

<p>Give each guest a slip of paper, folded, containing
words which can be acted in pantomime.  Each one must
keep his a secret, as the rest of the company guess
what he is acting out.</p>

<p>The players sit in a circle, and the one acting in
pantomime his words, stands in the middle where all
can see him.</p>

<p>Suppose one had "Dog" on his slip, he
would pretend to pet him, call him, and make him perform.
Another might have "Blackberries" and make
all the imaginary motions of picking and eating them,
and being caught on the bushes. If one has "Strawberry
shortcake," she can go through the process of
making the imaginary cake, and hulling the berries
for it.</p>

<p>As soon as it is guessed what the player's word
is, the rest call it out.</p>

<a name="102"></a>
<h2>BIRDS FLY.</h2>

<p>The players sit in a circle, one person who is quick
and witty is chosen as leader. He stands in the center
of the circle.</p>

<p>Whenever he mentions any animal that flies all the
players make a flying motion with their hands, but
if he names something that doesn't fly, he alone
makes the motions; if any player makes the motion when
he ought to be still he is out of the game. Suppose
the leader begins by saying "Parrots fly,"
all must move their hands up and down whether the
leader does or not, but if he says next time "Horses
fly," all must remain still.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to call the names quickly, inserting
many that don't fly, when the players are excited,
so they will be confused and many will be out.</p>

<a name="103"></a>
<h2>TRIPS AROUND THE WORLD.</h2>

<p>There are several ways of playing this game, here
are two. Provide each guest with a little paper book
to represent a guide book and a pencil.</p>

<p>Articles of all kinds have been scattered around the
room to represent different countries, states, or
cities.  A little package of tea suggests China; a
paper fan, Japan; a piece of cotton batting, Louisiana;
a wooden shoe, Holland; a stein, Germany; and so on.
Allow a certain length of time for the guesses, then
collect the little books, and the player who has guessed
the greatest number correctly receives a prize.</p>

<p>Another way. The players sit in a circle, Number One
names some place beginning with the letter A, and
asks No. 2 what he shall do there. No. 2 answers in
words beginning with A, and he, in turn names a city
commencing with B, and asks No. 3 the question. Thus
each player must answer the question of his neighbor,
and name another place.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>"I am going to America, what shall I do there?"</p>

<p>"Admire Astrakhan Apples. I am bound for Boston,
what shall I do there?"</p>

<p>"Bake beans and brown bread. My journey takes
me to Chicago, what shall I do there?"</p>

<p>"Catch cold," etc., etc.</p>

<a name="104"></a>
<h2>JACK'S ALIVE.</h2>

<p>A piece of kindling wood is held in the fire until
it is well lighted. It is then passed from one player
to the other, each one saying in turn, "Jack's
alive." The instant the stick ceases to burn
"Jack" is "dead" and the one
who is then holding it has to pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>It is passed very quickly from one to the other, as
each player wishes to get rid of it before the spark
goes out.</p>

<p>For a forfeit, the man who was holding it will have
to undergo the process of having a black mustache
made with the charred end of the stick.</p>

<a name="105"></a>
<h2>GOING A-FISHING.</h2>

<p>Cut a number of small fishes about two inches long
out of cardboard. Each fish counts five, but two,
which may be a little larger, are numbered ten. A
loop is made with thread on the back of each fish.</p>

<p>Rods (sticks about a foot long with string, at the
end of which is a bent pin, fastened to each) are
provided for the players.</p>

<p>The fishes are placed on the floor or table and, at
the word "ready" from the leader, all
the players go a-fishing. Each tries his best to hold
his rod steady enough to slip the bent pin through
the loop of thread. As soon as a fish is caught all
must stop until the signal to begin again is given.</p>

<p>Everyone tries to catch the fishes marked ten, but
sometimes it is wiser to catch as many ordinary ones
as a person can, thus making more points. The player
scoring most points is victor.</p>

<a name="106"></a>
<h2>CONSEQUENCES.</h2>

<p>Provide each player with pencil and paper.  The first
thing to write on the paper is an adjective which
applies to a man. The paper is then folded over and
passed to the right. This time each one writes the
name of a man (either present or absent), folds the
paper so the next one can't see what is written,
and passes it on to the right. This is done each time
and the order of names is as follows after the first
two, then an adjective which applies to a lady, then
a lady's name; next, where they met; what he
said; then, what she said; the consequence; and last
of all, what the world said.</p>

<p>After all have finished writing "what the world
said," the papers are passed to the right, opened,
and read aloud.</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>Handsome Mr. ----
(met) Pretty Miss (at) The Fair (he said)
Have you heard the news? (she said) I intend to
go home. (the consequence was) They never spoke
again. (the world said) "As you like it."</blockquote>

<a name="107"></a>
<h2>PERSONAL CONUNDRUMS.</h2>

<p>The guests are requested to think up some conundrums
about some person in the present company.</p>

<p>Each one in turn gives his conundrum and the player
to his left must answer it if he can; if he fails,
any one present may help him out.</p>

<p>The conundrums may be written if preferred, mixed
up in a hat or basket and each player takes one to
answer.</p>

<p>Some of them may prove very funny. For the best conundrum
and best answer given, a prize may be awarded.</p>

<p>Examples--</p>

<p>Why is Mr. ---- like the flatiron
building?</p>

<p>Because he is so very tall.</p>

<p>Why is Miss ---- like sugar?</p>

<p>Because she is easily melted, that is, overcome.</p>

<a name="108"></a>
<h2>HUNTING THE WHISTLE.</h2>

<p>The players who know how to play this game stay in
one room, while the others go into the hall, or another
room. Those knowing the trick sit down in chairs which
have been arranged in two rows, with an aisle between.</p>

<p>The leader calls one in from the other room and explains
to him that there is a whistle in the room, and as
he hears it blown he must find it. He can make a long
speech about the whistle so as to interest the player,
because someone is then pinning the whistle, (which
is on the end of a string) to the player's coat.</p>

<p>Both the leader and player stand at one end of the
room, between the two rows of chairs.  When the leader
says "go," the player starts on his hunt.
The rest of the players pretend they have the whistle,
and blow it whenever it chances to pass their way.
Thus the player is kept going from side to side until
finally someone happens to pull the string and he
feels it and discovers the whistle on his own coat.
He then takes his place with the rest in the row and
another one is called in and goes through the same
hunt. Thus it continues until all the players know
the game.</p>

<a name="109"></a>
<h2>THE FIVE SENSES.</h2>

<p>All the players sit in a circle. No. 1 begins by naming
something he has seen, being careful what his last
word is, as it must furnish him with a rhyme for the
rest of the game.  Each player in turn tells what
he has seen, then No. 1 repeats his first statement
and adds what he heard, the next time, what he tasted;
then what he smelt; and lastly, what he felt.  For
example, No. 1 says, "I saw a ring of solid gold."
No. 2 says, "I saw a boy fall off the car."</p>

<p>The second time round No. 1 says,</p>

<blockquote>"I saw a ring of solid gold.<br />
I heard a story twice told."</blockquote>

<p>No. 2 says,</p>

<blockquote>"I saw a boy fall off the car.<br />
I heard the war news from afar."</blockquote>

<p>and so on, after going around five times, No.  1's
complete rhyme would be,</p>

<blockquote>"I saw a ring of solid gold.<br />
I heard a story twice told.<br />
I tasted cheese that was too old.<br />
I smelt hay that soon would mould.<br />
I felt for something I couldn't
hold."</blockquote>

<p>Do not have the verses written as there is more fun
in trying to remember one's rhyme.</p>

<a name="110"></a>
<h2>WIGGLES.</h2>

<p>Provide each guest with pencil and paper.  Papers
four inches square will be large enough.  Each player
draws a line about an inch and a half long with one
or more quirks in it, in the upper left hand corner
of the paper.</p>

<p>The papers are then passed to the player to the right
who must draw some picture out of the "wiggle"
in the corner. The paper may be turned in any position.
Allow five minutes for the drawings.</p>

<p>At the end of this time, each one writes his name
on the paper and hands it to the hostess.  A committee
is appointed to decide upon the best "wiggle-picture"
and a prize is awarded to the artist. Examples--</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="6.png" src="6.png" /></p>

<p>The heaviest line is the wiggle.</p>

<a name="111"></a>
<h2>TELEGRAM.</h2>

<p>Provide the players with pencil and paper.  Each one
then writes on his piece of paper ten letters of the
alphabet in any order, using no letter twice. The
papers are then passed to the right and each one is
requested to write a telegram, using the ten letters
for the beginning of the ten words, just in the order
given.  The papers are then passed again and the telegrams
are read aloud. Some will be very amusing.</p>

<p>Examples--</p>

<p>A. E. F. J. K. L. N. O. P. T. Am ever frightfully
jealous. Keep lookout now on Pa's tricks.</p>

<p>C. B. D. W. G. H. S. I. M. Y. Come back.  Down with
Grandma. How shall I meet you?</p>

<a name="112"></a>
<h2>SPELLING MATCH.</h2>

<p>Choose leaders and divide the company into sides.
The sides stand opposite each other as in the old-fashioned
spelling match.</p>

<p>The leader, who may be the hostess, has a spelling
book from which she selects the words which the players
must spell backwards.  Words of one or two syllables
may be chosen, and if, when spelt backwards, they
spell other words, so much the better.</p>

<p>The players take turns, one on one side, and one on
the other, and so on, until all have spelled. If any
fail to spell the word backwards, or do not pronounce
it afterward, if it can be pronounced, they must drop
out. The side which stands up the longest is the winning
side.</p>

<p>Some words are:</p>

<pre>Star   Now   Pan   Dew
Mat    Eve   Bard  Tub
Stop   Eel   Tops  Ton
Ten    On    Den   Nun</pre>

<a name="113"></a>
<h2>POOR PUSSY.</h2>

<p>All the players sit in a circle, one being chosen
out. This one kneels before each player in turn and
says, in pitiful tones: "Meow!"  Each
player, when addressed by "pussy," must
say, without smiling: "Poor Pussy."</p>

<p>"Pussy" addresses each player three times,
trying her best to make the players laugh. If the
one she is kneeling before does laugh, they exchange
places, but if not, "pussy" moves on to
the next one.</p>

<a name="114"></a>
<h2>GUESSES.</h2>

<p>Each player receives a slip of paper and pencil.
The leader begins by saying: "Guess how high
the door is." "Guess how thick that book
is." "Guess how tall Mr.  Blank is."
"How far does this chair stand from the floor,"</p>

<p>He allows a few seconds after each question for the
players to write their answers. After twenty or more
guesses have been asked, the papers are passed to
the right hand neighbor for correction.</p>

<p>The leader then measures each article, person, or
thing, with a tape measure, and the guesses on the
lists are checked off. The person who has a correct
list deserves something for a reward.</p>

<a name="115"></a>
<h2>NUT RACE.</h2>

<p>Choose two captains from the company, who select sides
until all the guests are on one side or the other.</p>

<p>Place a pile of mixed nuts on the floor and an empty
bowl about three feet from it, at one end of the room
and at the other end another pile and bowl.</p>

<p>The captains and their sides stand by their respective
pile of nuts. When the signal is given each captain
takes as many nuts on the back of his left hand from
the pile as he can gather without the aid of his right
hand and carries them to the empty bowl at the opposite
side of the room. The players follow the captain in
turn continuing until the pile is gone and the bowl
is full.</p>

<p>The side which succeeds in filling its bowl first
is victorious.</p>

<a name="116"></a>
<h2>TORN FLOWERS.</h2>

<p>Prepare a table full of different colored tissue paper,
bottles of mucilage and white cards, one for each
guest.</p>

<p>The players sit around the table, the hostess gives
each a card and announces that each one is to make
a flower out of the tissue paper, but as there are
no scissors each one must tear his paper and every
one knows how hard it is to tear tissue paper. Each
one keeps the name of his flower a secret. As they
are made they are pasted on the cards. Each card is
numbered and when all are done "tearing,"
the cards are collected and placed on a table for
exhibition.</p>

<p>The player guessing the greatest number of flowers
correctly receives a prize. The game may be varied,
as either animals or vegetables could be torn.</p>

<a name="117"></a>
<h2>SPEARING PEANUTS.</h2>

<p>Fill a cup with peanuts, two of which are blackened
with ink on one end.</p>

<p>The guests play one at a time. No. 1 sits down by
a table, empties the cup of peanuts in a pile on it
and is given a hatpin with which she spears the peanuts
one at a time without disturbing the pile, and places
them back in the cup. A few minutes is allowed each
player; when the time is up, the peanuts in the cup
are counted, the blackened ones count ten apiece and
the plain ones, one.</p>

<p>Tally is kept for each player and a suitable prize
is given to the one who succeeded in securing the
largest score.</p>

<a name="118"></a>
<h2>PEANUT HUNT AND SCRAMBLE.</h2>

<p>Before the guests enter the room, hide peanuts in
every conceivable place, behind pictures, under chairs,
on the gas fixtures, among the ornaments, five or
six in vases, etc.</p>

<p>Give each guest a paper bag as he enters the room
into which he places all the peanuts he finds. Allow
a certain length of time for the hunt, then collect
all the bags and select a good tall person who stands
on a chair and empties the contents of each bag on
the floor as fast as he can and a lively scramble
for them ensues, then the one who has the greatest
number of whole peanuts collected deserves a prize;
the others can eat their peanuts as a comfort.</p>

<a name="119"></a>
<h2>MUSICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.</h2>

<p>A blackboard and different colored chalk will be necessary
for this game.</p>

<p>Give each guest a slip of paper on which is written
the name of some song.</p>

<p>The leader announces that each one in turn steps up
to the blackboard and illustrates his song in the
most vivid manner possible. Each player is numbered
and after No. 1 finishes his drawing the others write
their guesses on paper opposite his number and No.
2 erases the former drawing and illustrates his song.
Thus each one takes his turn, allowing time for the
others to write their guesses.</p>

<p>When all have had their turn the correct list is read
by the leader, the players checking their own lists.
Prizes may be given to the one having the most correct
answers and to the person who illustrated his song
the most artistically.</p>

<p>Suggestions for songs are "Sweet Bunch of Daisies,"
"The Four-Leaf Clover." "My Old
Kentucky Home" may be illustrated by drawing
a house in the outline of the state of Kentucky; "Home,
Sweet Home," by a house and a jar of sweets
near it; "America," by the outline of North
America.</p>

<a name="120"></a>
<h2>AN APPLE HUNT.</h2>

<p>The hostess should prepare beforehand cards four inches
square and outline on each an apple by dots concealing
the outline with other dots. In one corner of the
card is stuck a needle containing enough green thread
to outline the apple. These "apples" are
then hidden by groups, five in a group, in different
parts of the room.</p>

<p>A set of directions is prepared such as, No.  1, "Look
under the mat"; No. 2, "Look under a certain
rocking-chair," and so on. Five of these directions
are sufficient, the last one telling where the apple
is hidden. There are different sets of directions
lettered A, B, C, etc., five in a set, all lettered
alike; the group of five apples being at the end of
each set of directions.</p>

<p>As each guest arrives he is given No. 1 of some set.
Following that, he finds No. 2, and so on, until he
finds the five apples, one of which he takes, finds
the dotted apple, threads the needle and outlines
it with the green cotton.  The one who succeeds in
finding his apple first and makes the neatest outline
is the winner.</p>

<a name="121"></a>
<h2>SHOUTING PROVERBS.</h2>

<p>The more playing this game, the merrier it will be.
Send one of the players from the room. The others
decide upon a familiar proverb which he is to guess
when he returns. Suppose the one chosen is "A
rolling stone gathers no moss." Beginning with
the leader and going to the left each player in turn
takes one word, thus the leader has "a,"
the next "rolling," the next "stone"
and so on, repeating it until every player has a word.
If the company is large two or three might have the
same word.</p>

<p>When the one who was out is summoned in, he counts
1,2,3; when he says 3, all the players shout their
word. It will be very confusing and hard to hear any
one word, but after the second or third trial, one
word which was heard above the rest might suggest the
whole proverb.</p>

<p>The player who is out is given five trials in which
to guess; if he does not succeed, he must go out again,
but if he has listened attentively to one or two,
and has guessed correctly, the player whose shouting
gave away the proverb is then sent out and the game
continues as before.</p>

<a name="122"></a>
<h2>BAKER'S DOZEN.</h2>

<p>This game is just for two and is similar to Tit-tat-to.
Make a drawing like the illustration and the game
is ready.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="7.png" src="7.png" /></p>

<p>No. 1 chooses a figure which No. 2 must try to guess
by indicating with a pencil dot or mark at the side
of the different spaces, until he has guessed the
number chosen.</p>

<p>The numbers in the different spaces marked by No.
2 are added to his score; and those unmarked are added
to No. 1.</p>

<p>Suppose No. 1 chooses 13, and No. 2 marks first 4,
then 10, 9, 5, 2, and finally 13, the sum of all these
(43) will be No. 2's score, while the sum of
the numbers unmarked (48) belongs to No. 1.</p>

<p>The game may be played as long as is desirable, but
it is more exciting to have a fixed number, such as
300 or 500.</p>

<a name="123"></a>
<h2>PEANUT CONTEST.</h2>

<p>Place two small bowls on a table at one end of the
room, at the other end of the room on a table have
two bags of peanuts and two knives.</p>

<p>The players may choose partners in any way desired.
The partners play together.</p>

<p>The leader gives a signal, watches the time and keeps
tally. When the signal is given a player, with his
partner, steps to the table containing the peanuts,
each takes a knife and when the leader says "go,"
each places as many peanuts as he can on the blade
of the knife and carries it with one hand to the other
end of the room, where he deposits the peanuts and
returns for more. As many trips can be made as the
time will allow. Three minutes is good time.</p>

<p>When the time is up the leader says, "Stop,"
and the number of peanuts in each bowl is counted
and accredited to the two players.  Each pair takes
turn in playing, time and tally being kept for each
until all have played.</p>

<p>The list of contestants is read aloud, the partners
who succeeded in carrying the greatest number of peanuts
to their bowls receive a prize.</p>

<a name="124"></a>
<h2>DEFINITIONS.</h2>

<p>Provide each player with pencil and paper.  The leader
has a dictionary which she opens at any place and
selects a word which the rest are to define.</p>

<p>The players write the word and their definition of
it on the slips of paper. When the leader taps a bell
all the slips must be collected and mixed up in a
basket or hat.</p>

<p>Each player then draws out a slip and the definitions
are read aloud in turn. The leader decides which one
has written a definition most like the one in the
dictionary. The author of the best one rises, receives
the dictionary, gives out a word and the game proceeds
as before.</p>

<a name="125"></a>
<h2>ALPHABETICAL ANSWERS.</h2>

<p>Prepare cards with one letter of the alphabet on each,
omitting V, X, Z. Of course if the company is large,
several will have the same letter.</p>

<p>The cards are pinned on the guests, and it is announced
that no one must answer any question presented to
him except by a sentence commencing with the letter
on his card, the answer being given before the questioner
could count ten.</p>

<p>No two players can question a person at the same time,
and no one can give the same answer twice.</p>

<p>If a player begins his reply with a wrong letter or
does not answer in time, his letter is taken from
him by his questioner, who adds it to his and he then
has the privilege of answering with either of his
letters. The player who is without a card is supplied
with one again but after the third trial he is out
of the game.</p>

<a name="126"></a>
<h2>PITCH BASKET.</h2>

<p>Select a number of small fruit baskets, all the same
size, and have a box of checkers handy.  Suppose you
have five, on the bottom of one mark 20, on another
15, on two, 5; and on the other, 0. Place the baskets
in a row on the floor so their numbers cannot be seen.</p>

<p>Choose sides, giving the red checkers to the leader
of one side and the black checkers to the other. One
side lines up about 10 ft. away from the baskets,
the leader giving each player a checker; if there
are any left he keeps them and has the privilege of
throwing them. Each one in turn throws his checker
into any basket, trusting to luck that they fall into
a basket with a number on it.</p>

<p>When all have played the leader turns up each basket
to see its number and counts the number of checkers
thrown into it. If there were two in basket No. 20,
it would count 40; if 3 in one basket No. 5, it would
be 15; if four in the other basket No. 5, 20; and if
there were 3 in basket 0, it would count nothing.
Thus the score for that side is 75. The players on
the other side line up and play as the others did.
The order of the baskets must be changed by someone
not of that side, so no one knows which is which.
Their score is added up.</p>

<p>The game continues until a certain number, 300 or
500, has been reached. The side scoring that number
of points first is victorious.</p>

<a name="127"></a>
<h2>WHO AM I?</h2>

<p>As the guests arrive pin a card with a name of some
noted author, statesman, or poet written on it, on
their backs, so that every one can see it but themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, each person wants to know who he is, so
the guests talk to each other as though they were
the person whose name is on the other's back,
but do not mention the name, and from the conversation,
they have to guess who they are.</p>

<a name="128"></a>
<h2>PROGRESSIVE PUZZLES.</h2>

<p>The players are provided with pasteboard cards 2 inches
square, and scissors. At a signal, given by the hostess,
they must cut their cards in four pieces, the cuts
must intersect in some place, but the card can be
cut in any other way.</p>

<p>When the cards are cut and the four pieces mixed,
they are passed to the player at the right, who has
to put the four pieces together correctly.</p>

<p>A certain time is given for each puzzle and each time
it is passed to the right, until each player has his
own puzzle again.</p>

<a name="129"></a>
<h2>TIT FOR TAT.</h2>

<p>Plan to have an even number of guests invited, half
ladies and half gentlemen.</p>

<p>Provide thick boards for each lady, also a hammer
and paper of tacks, and for the men, plain hats (untrimmed)
and material for trimming, also a paper of pins.</p>

<p>When all the guests arrive set them to work.  The
ladies have to hammer as many tacks in straight, in
their boards as they can, during the allotted time,
while the men trim their hats, choosing their material
from that which is provided. When the time (which may
be as long or as short as you wish) is up, the men
put on their respective hats and pass before the ladies
for inspection; the one having the best trimmed one
receives a prize.</p>

<p>The men inspect the work of the ladies, and the one
who has hammered the most tacks into her board "straight,"
receives a prize.</p>

<a name="130"></a>
<h2>EYE-GUESSING.</h2>

<p>Hang a sheet or screen in a doorway between two rooms
and cut six holes, the size and shape of eyes, each
pair a distance apart, in it, some up high and some
down low.</p>

<p>Choose groups of four to go behind the sheet, the
rest of the guests staying in the other room.</p>

<p>Three of the chosen four look through the holes at
a time. The short ones can stand on chairs and look
through the high pair, while the tall ones can stoop
down, thus confusing those who have to guess who the
pairs of eyes belong to.</p>

<p>A short time is given for guessing each group, and
then the next set go out.</p>

<p>The guesses are written on slips of paper and after
all the eyes have been "examined," the
correct list is read by one who stayed behind the
sheet all the time.</p>

<a name="131"></a>
<h2>THE PRINCE OF WALES.</h2>

<p>Any number can play this game. The players stand in
a line around the room and number themselves, beginning
with one, until each has a number.</p>

<p>The leader, who has no number and who has charge of
the game, begins by saying--</p>

<p>"The Prince of Wales has lost his hat, all on
account of No. 1, Sir;" then No. 1 says: "No,
sir, not I, sir, No. 5, (or any number he wishes),
sir." Then No. 5, repeats what No.  1 said, giving
another number instead of 5; but if he fails to respond,
then the leader says, "No. 5 to the foot, sir,"
and then all those who were below No. 5 move up one,
and thus their number becomes one less.</p>

<p>The leader begins again and he must be very quick
to send those to the foot, who fail to respond.</p>

<a name="132"></a>
<h2>COMMERCE.</h2>

<p>The guests are seated around a table, each one having
a pile of fifty beans in front of him.  The leader
has two packs of playing cards, one of which is used
for an auction sale, one card at a time being sold
to the highest bidder, who pays for it in beans.</p>

<p>When all the cards of the first pack have been sold,
the players arrange their cards and beans on the table
ready for business.</p>

<p>The auctioneer then holds up the second pack and announces
that he will call the cards off one at a time, and
as he does so, the player who has the duplicate of
that card must give it up to the auctioneer.</p>

<p>After each calling there is a little time allowed
to buy or sell the cards, the object of the game being
either to have more beans than any one else, or to
have the duplicate card which is at the bottom of the
second pack, thus causing a very exciting time as the
second pile diminishes.</p>

<a name="133"></a>
<h2>LAUGH A LITTLE.</h2>

<p>The players sit in a circle with one in the middle
for leader. The leader must be one who laughs heartily
and is very quick.</p>

<p>He begins the game by throwing a plain, white handkerchief
up in the air, as high as he can, and while it is
in the air, everyone must laugh, but the minute it
touches the floor, there must be perfect silence.
The leader must catch those who are still laughing
and send them from the ring.</p>

<p>The game goes on until every one is out of the circle.
If there should happen to be one who doesn't
laugh when the handkerchief is on the floor, he surely
deserves a prize.</p>

<a name="134"></a>
<h2>LOCATION.</h2>

<p>Choose two leaders who select sides. One begins by
calling the name of some town or place and then counts
ten. While he is counting, the opposite opponent must
answer where the place is. If he fails to answer before
ten is counted, he must drop out.</p>

<p>Then the leader of the other side takes his turn,
and challenges some player of the opposite side.</p>

<p>The side which stands up the longest, wins the game.</p>

<a name="135"></a>
<h2>FASHION NOTES.</h2>

<p>The names of various fashion papers, such as "The
Delineator," "The Styles," "Le
Bon Ton," "Ladies' Home Journal,"
are written on cards, which are cut so that it requires
the two parts to know what the title is. Distribute
these among the guests, who hunt for the corresponding
part, thus getting their partners; crayon and paper
is given out and the ladies are requested to draw
and color a gown representing the one she has on,
while the men are asked to write a description of the
gown.</p>

<p>The drawings and descriptions are collected after
time is allowed, and placed on a table for display.</p>

<p>Prizes may be awarded to the partners having the best
drawing and description.</p>

<a name="136"></a>
<h2>STRAY SYLLABLES.</h2>

<p>Prepare long strips of paper on which the guests are
requested to write several words of three or more
syllables, leaving spaces between each syllable.</p>

<p>When this is done, cut up the words into the syllables
and mix thoroughly. Then each player draws three syllables
and tries to construct a word.</p>

<p>If a word can't be made of all three syllables,
maybe it can be made of two, but if it is then impossible
to construct a word, the player must wait until the
rest draw three syllables again, and perchance he
may be able to construct two words, using the syllables
he could not use before.</p>

<p>The one constructing the most words, wins the game.</p>

<a name="137"></a>
<h2>QUAKER MEETING.</h2>

<p>All the guests sit in a circle and the leader begins
by saying: "This is a very solemn occasion."
 He then twirls his thumbs and looks very solemn.
Commencing with the player to the right of the leader,
each one in turn repeats what he has said, very solemnly
twirls his thumbs, and keeps twirling them, until
each one has repeated it, and it is the leader's
turn again.</p>

<p>He then says, "Sister Jane died last night,"
still twirling his thumbs. This goes around the circle
as before. Then the player to the right of the leader
says, "How did she die?"  and he replies,
"Like this," moving his right hand up
and down. Thus each one tells his neighbor, and makes
the motion just as the leader has done.</p>

<p>After each one has said this, still repeating the
same question and answer, the leader moves his left
hand up and down, too, thus both hands are going;
the next time both hands and the right foot are moving;
then both hands and both feet; next, hands, feet, and
head, bobbing up and down; last, fall back in the
chair uttering a hideous groan as if dead.</p>

<p>No one must laugh during the whole game; whoever does,
must leave the circle.</p>

<a name="138"></a>
<h2>MAGIC MUSIC.</h2>

<p>One player is sent from the room and the rest decide
upon something he must do when called in.</p>

<p>When this has been done he is summoned by magic music
which is made by having one of the players strike
on something which will make a noise. If there is
a piano, so much the better, if not, a piece of metal
or a bell will do.</p>

<p>As he nears the object which he is to find the music
grows very loud, and faint when he is far away.</p>

<p>Suppose he is to take a flower from a vase, and give
it to one of the players. As he nears the flowers,
the music grows louder and louder, and if he touches
one, it stops; then he knows he has to do something
with it. If he smells it, the music grows faint, and
he knows he is wrong. As he starts to give it to the
players, the music varies until he has given it to
the right one.</p>

<p>Someone else then leaves the room, and the game goes
on as before.</p>

<a name="139"></a>
<h2>PATCHWORK ILLUSTRATIONS.</h2>

<p>For this game it is necessary for the hostess to collect
a large number of pictures from magazines, advertisement
pages or papers. These are placed in the center of
a table around which the players are seated.</p>

<p>Each guest is provided with a paper at the top of
which is written a quotation. The hostess announces
that each player is to illustrate his or her quotation
with the pictures provided. The pictures are pasted
on the papers, and if necessary, a background can be
made with pencil or pen and ink.</p>

<p>The papers are then arranged on a table for inspection
and a prize is awarded for the best illustration.</p>

<a name="140"></a>
<h2>BIOGRAPHY.</h2>

<p>Provide the players with pencil and paper.  The leader
then announces that a biography is to be written,
and the first thing to write is the name of some person
in the room; the paper is folded over so the name
cannot be seen and passed to the player at his left,
who writes a date which is the birth date, and the
name of some town; the paper is folded again and passed
to the left and this time a sentence of ten words
is written about early childhood--from one
to ten years. Next, a sentence of same length telling
of events between twenty and forty years; next, between
forty and fifty years; date of death next, last, remark
about this life. When all has been written, the folded
papers are passed to the left again and each player
reads his paper aloud.</p>

<p>The more ridiculous the sentences, the better the
biography, and as no one knows what is under the folded
parts, sometimes the date of death will be earlier
than that of birth, or there will be a vast difference
in time.</p>

<p>Example--Name, John Smith. Born, July 4,
1449, Boston. From 1 to 10 years, mischievous child,
quarrelled with everybody, expelled from school, stole
eggs.</p>

<p>From 20 to 40, stayed home, did dressmaking, became
sickly, remained an old maid.</p>

<p>From 40 to 50, became a wealthy widower, left with
three children to raise. Died January 1, 1860. Most
remarkable man that ever lived in his little town.</p>

<a name="141"></a>
<h2>ORCHESTRA.</h2>

<p>Any number can play this game, the more the merrier.
Each player is told to play some imaginary instrument.
The leader with an imaginary baton, begins by humming
some lively, familiar tune. The players follow with
motions suitable to their instruments and sing the
tune the leader is humming.</p>

<p>When the leader pretends to play some instrument,
the player who has that imaginary instrument, must
pretend he is leader and beat time with the baton,
but as soon as the real leader changes the instrument
or beats time again the player must continue with his
own instrument.</p>

<p>The leader must be quick to change from one instrument
to another and the players must be quick to follow
him, for if they don't, they have to leave the
orchestra until the piece is over.</p>

<a name="142"></a>
<h2>WHO IS MY NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR?</h2>

<p>Half of the company are blindfolded. They are led
to a row of chairs arranged in the middle of the room,
each sitting so there is a vacant chair behind him.</p>

<p>The other half, who are not blindfolded, very quietly
take the vacant chairs and sit perfectly still.</p>

<p>The leader then announces that those not blindfolded
are to sing when he gives the signal, and the blindfolded
ones, who are to remain still, must listen attentively
to their right hand neighbor and guess who he is.</p>

<p>Some familiar tunes must be chosen and the singers
can disguise their voices if they choose.  The leader
begins by playing the tune on the piano and when he
says "Sing," the victim singers begin while
the blind victims listen.</p>

<p>One verse of the song will be enough for this medley
and those whose voices have been recognized, exchange
places with the blindfolded ones, while the others
remain in the same place until the listener has guessed
who he is. The game then goes on as before.</p>

<a name="143"></a>
<h2>FIRE.</h2>

<p>Choose two leaders from among the players.  Each leader
chooses his side. The sides sit opposite each other,
the leader of one throws a ball to any one in the
opposite side. As he does he says either, "Earth,"
"Air," "Water," or "Fire,"
and counts ten.</p>

<p>The person who caught the ball must answer before
he finishes counting ten. If "earth" was
called he must name some quadruped found therein;
if "water," some fish must be named, or
"air," the name of some bird; but if "fire"
was called he must remain perfectly still.</p>

<p>If the players give a wrong answer or speak when they
should be silent they are out, and the leader must
throw the ball to some one else, but if the players
answer correctly, it is their turn to throw the ball
to someone in the opposite side, and the game goes
on as before.  The side whose players stand up the
longest, wins the game.</p>

<a name="144"></a>
<h2>THE MONTHS.</h2>

<p>The leader need be the only one who understands this
game. He asks, "What month are you going away
in?" One player might answer "September."
He then asks, "What will you wear?" "What
will you take with you?" and "What will
you do?"  All the answers must be given with
the initial letter of the month chosen. For instance,
the answers to the above questions may be: 1st, "Silk
stockings," 2d, "Sardine sandwiches,"
3d, "See the sights."</p>

<p>The answers will probably be mixed as the players
do not know the trick. Each one who misses pays a
forfeit, and the leader questions the next player.
When one or two do catch on, the more ridiculous they
make their answers, the funnier the game.</p>

<a name="145"></a>
<h2>BELL BUFF.</h2>

<p>In this game all the players except one are blindfolded.
This one is called the guide and has a small bell
which he rings during the game.</p>

<p>All the blind men are led to one end of the room by
the guide. He then takes his position a little distance
from them and rings the bell, which is the signal
for the game to begin.</p>

<p>The blind men grope around wildly for their guide
who rings the bell all the time, but must move in
different places, so as to escape the blind men who
are hunting him. The blind men are only guided by the
sound of the bell, and the guide must be very quick
to change his positions or he will be caught by his
pursuers.</p>

<p>The first blind man who catches the guide, exchanges
places with him, and the game goes on as before.</p>

<a name="146"></a>
<h2>POSTMAN.</h2>

<p>The players sit in a circle; one is chosen for "postman,"
is blindfolded, and another is chosen for Postmaster.</p>

<p>The Postmaster gives each player the name of some
city or town, and stands outside the ring so he can
give orders.</p>

<p>The "postman" stands inside the circle
and when the Postmaster says, "I have sent a
letter from New York to San Francisco," the players
having these names must exchange places, and he must
try to capture one. If he succeeds he takes that one's
place, the one caught then becoming "postman."</p>

<p>The Postmaster must exchange names very rapidly, and
if a player should remain seated when his city is
called, he has to be "postman."</p>

<p>If the Postmaster says, "general delivery,"
all exchange places, and the "postman"
tries to secure a vacant place.</p>

<a name="147"></a>
<h2>SPOONEY FUN.</h2>

<p>All the players sit in a circle. One is chosen to
be out. He is blindfolded and given a spoon (a large
one) with which he is to feel. He stands in the middle
of the circle, then is turned around three times and
told to guess who the first person, which he touches
with the spoon, is.</p>

<p>He advances cautiously until he touches someone. Then
with the back of the spoon he feels the person all
over. The players must keep perfectly quiet, disguising
themselves if they see fit, as the collars and cuffs
of the men will be felt very easily with the spoon.</p>

<p>As soon as the blindfolded one has guessed who the
player is he was feeling, they exchange places and
the game goes on as before, but if he fails to guess
the first time, or has felt with his hand instead of
the spoon he is out again and remains out, until he
has guessed correctly.</p>

<a name="148"></a>
<h2>CITIES.</h2>

<p>Provide all the guests with pencil and paper.  The
hostess then requests that each write the name of
the city in which he was born, and under that a sentence,
descriptive of that city or containing something suggestive
of it. The letters of the city form the words of the
sentence and must follow in regular order.</p>

<p>Allow fifteen minutes for composing the sentences,
then collect them, mix them up, and each player is
given one. Thus each one has some other person's
slip to read. The one who composed the best sentences
deserves a prize.</p>

<p>Examples--City, New York.</p>

<p>Sentence--N-ow, E-very, W-all St., Y-ankee,
O-wns, R-eal, K-ingdoms.</p>

<p>City, Chicago.</p>

<p>Sentence--Conflagration, H-igh, I-n, C-rowded,
A-reas, G-rew, O-n.</p>

<a name="149"></a>
<h2>GOING TO CHINA.</h2>

<p>This is a catch game for those who have never played
it. The leader begins by saying, "I'm
going to sail for China next week, I would like to
have you go, what will you take?" This question
is asked every player and there are many different
answers, but all cannot go, as they have not answered
correctly.</p>

<p>The point is, if you wish to go sailing, you must
take something which commences with the same letter
as the initial of your last name.  The leader then
says, "You can go."</p>

<p>For example, suppose the player who is asked the question
says she will take bananas.  If her last name begins
with B she can go, but if not, the leader says, "Lou
cannot go this trip."</p>

<p>The game continues until every one has guessed the
trick and they can all go.</p>

<a name="150"></a>
<h2>A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS.</h2>

<p>Provide each player with pencil and paper and a penny.
The hostess explains that the answers to the following
questions are things which are found on every penny.</p>

<p>The questions may either be written on the paper beforehand
or the guests can write them as the hostess asks them.
A prize may be awarded to the player whose paper contains
the greatest number of correct answers.</p>

</ol>

<a name="151"></a>
<h2>MISQUOTED QUOTATIONS.</h2>

<p>Choose very familiar quotations from Longfellow, Shakespeare,
Tennyson, or any well-known author or poet, and write
them on slips of paper.</p>

<p>Change some of the words of the original, or even
a whole line, and when each guest receives his slip
he is requested to repeat the quotation correctly.</p>

<p>For example--"To be, or not to be;
that is the question," may be written, "To
be, or not to be: that is the problem."</p>

<a name="152"></a>
<h2>LITERARY SALAD.</h2>

<p>Salad leaves are prepared for this game by folding
and twisting pieces of green tissue paper until they
look like lettuce leaves. Then paste slips of white
paper containing a quotation, on each leaf.</p>

<p>The participants of this salad are requested to guess
the name of the author of their quotation.  This may
be played very easily at a church social where the
leaves may contain Bible verses instead of quotations,
and the players are asked to tell just where their
verses are found, in what book and chapter.</p>

<a name="153"></a>
<h2>BROKEN QUOTATIONS.</h2>

<p>This is a good game to play at the beginning of a
social gathering, as the guests have to mingle together
and thus become better acquainted, and the stiffness
of a formal gathering passes off.</p>

<p>The hostess has prepared familiar quotations which
were written on paper and then cut in two or three
parts and pinned in different places around the room.</p>

<p>The guests are requested to find as many quotations
as they can during a certain length of time.</p>

<p>As the parts are scattered all over the room, it isn't
as easy as it sounds to find the complete quotations.
The person gathering the most quotations, deserves
a prize.</p>

<a name="154"></a>
<h2>PARCEL DELIVERY.</h2>

<p>Packages of all shapes and sizes and securely wrapped
up are prepared by the hostess who has numbered each
one. The players are provided with pencil and slips
of paper with numbers corresponding to the numbers
on the parcels, arranged down one side.</p>

<p>The guests sit in a circle and the packages are passed
from one to the other. Each one is allowed to feel
the packages as much as he pleases, but no one must
look inside.</p>

<p>As the packages are passed, the names, guessed by
the sense of touch, are written opposite their appropriate
numbers on the slips of paper.</p>

<p>After all the bundles have been passed, the hostess
opens each one and keeps account of those who have
guessed correctly, while those who have failed, are
requested to read their guesses as this affords much
amusement.</p>

<a name="155"></a>
<h2>WHO ARE THEY?</h2>

<p>Photographs of noted people, labelled with names that
do not belong to them, are hung about the room. Each
picture is numbered.</p>

<p>The guests, provided with pencil and paper, are given
a certain length of time in which to guess the correct
names, which are written opposite their corresponding
numbers.</p>

<p>Familiar photographs such as Dickens, Shakespeare,
Washington, Lincoln, Napoleon, etc., should be
chosen.</p>

<a name="156"></a>
<h2>SWAPS.</h2>

<p>The guests are requested to bring something wrapped
up in paper, which they wish to get rid of.</p>

<p>The hostess prepares a duplicate set of numbers, pinning
one number on each parcel, as the guests pass by her.
When she gives a signal (clapping hands or ringing
a bell), the two persons having No. 1 pinned on their
packages exchange them, those having No. 2, and so
on, until all have exchanged or swapped.  Then all
open their packages, some may have received better
things, while others may have a worse swap.</p>

<a name="157"></a>
<h2>TALKING SHOP.</h2>

<p>Partners may be chosen for this game by writing names
referring to ladies on one set of papers like, "Judy,"
"Jill," "Juliet," and names
referring to men on another set of papers like, "Punch,"
"Jack," "Romeo." Hand each
guest a slip of paper with the name on it and each
one hunts for his partner.</p>

<p>When all the partners are found, the leader announces
that at a given signal all the ladies are to talk
to their partners for five minutes about household
affairs, shopping, or fashions.  Each man listens
attentively to his partner, and when the five minutes
are up, he has to write a short account of her conversation,
on paper, which the hostess provides. Five minutes
is allowed for this.</p>

<p>Then the men talk to the ladies for five minutes about
business affairs, stocks, law, building or medicine,
and it is the ladies' turn to write a short
composition of what she heard.</p>

<p>The papers are collected, the hostess reads them,
and a prize is awarded to the best or most amusing
account.</p>

<a name="158"></a>
<h2>SIGHT UNSEEN.</h2>

<p>Partners may be chosen in any way for this game. The
host gives each pair a sheet of paper and pencil.
The partners decide among themselves which one is
the best artist, he or she (as the case may be) takes
the pencil and paper, while the other receives some
common object from the host.</p>

<p>The chairs must be arranged side by side, but facing
in opposite directions, so the one who is to draw
may not see the object his partner has. When the signal
is given to begin, the one having the object describes
it to his partner, who must draw it, from the description
given.</p>

<p>After twenty minutes have passed, the drawings and
their objects are collected, arranged side by side,
and it is decided by vote which drawing is most like
the object it represents.</p>

<a name="159"></a>
<h2>A STUDY IN ZOOLOGY.</h2>

<p>It will be necessary to have several sheets of silhouette
paper (black on one side and white on the other),
a large sheet of white cardboard, several pairs of
scissors, and as many pencils as there are players,
for this game.</p>

<p>Each player is handed a piece of silhouette paper,
on the white side of which is written a number and
the name of some animal. The players are handed pencils
and requested to draw the animal, assigned to each,
on the white side of the paper. The animals are then
cut out and handed to the hostess. Fifteen minutes
are allowed for this.</p>

<p>The hostess, having collected all the animals, pastes
them back side out, on the sheet of cardboard, and
writes a number corresponding to the one already on
the animal, underneath each. The cardboard sheet is
hung up where all can see and the players are handed
pieces of paper with numbers arranged down one side,
on which each player is to write opposite its corresponding
number what each animal is supposed to represent.</p>

<p>A prize may be given to the one guessing the greatest
number of animals correctly.</p>

<a name="160"></a>
<h2>AUCTION SALE</h2>

<p>Provide twenty or more bundles, all shapes and sizes,
securely wrapped. Each bundle has a name on it suggestive
of what is inside. For instance, "A pair of
kids," may contain two kid hair curlers, "A
bunch of dates," may be a calendar; "A
diamond pin," a dime and a pin.</p>

<p>Each guest is given a bag containing fifty beans,
no one can bid higher than fifty.</p>

<p>The auctioneer, who must be a witty person, who can
carry on a lively bidding, stands by a table where
the parcels are piled and carries on the sale until
all the parcels are sold.  The bundles are then opened
by the purchasers and there is much merriment over
the contents.</p>

<a name="161"></a>
<h2>THE GENTEEL LADY.</h2>

<p>The players sit in a circle. The leader begins by
saying, "I, a genteel lady (or gentleman, as
the case may be) always genteel, come to you, a genteel
lady (or gentleman) always genteel (bows to the player
on the right), from yonder genteel lady (or gentleman)
always genteel (bows to player on left), to tell you
that she has an eagle."</p>

<p>The next player repeats that word for word and adds
something about the eagle, for instance, the last
part may be, "to tell you that she has an eagle
with silver beak." The next player may add, "golden
claws," the next "emerald eyes,"
the next "purple feathers," and so on.</p>

<p>The players who repeat every word correctly, adding
their description of the eagle, remain "genteel,"
but those who make a mistake become "horned"
instead of "genteel."</p>

<p>The leader has charge of the "horns" which
may be toothpicks or pieces of paper twisted up tight.
For every mistake a "horn" is tucked in
the player's hair. Each player repeats what
the leader has said, but if the player next to him
is "horned," he must substitute "horned"
for "genteel" when referring to him.</p>

<p>When each one has repeated this tale, the players
who have "horns," and there will be many,
must pay a forefeit for every "horn" they
have.</p>

<a name="162"></a>
<h2>RHYMES.</h2>

<p>Provide each player with slips of paper and pencil.
The hostess then announces that each one is to write
some question at the top of the paper, fold the paper
over and pass it to the player at the left, who writes
a noun, folds the paper over and passes it to the left
again.</p>

<p>The players who then receive the slips are requested
to write one or more stanzas of poetry containing
the noun and question written at the top of the paper.</p>

<p>Allow fifteen minutes for this, then pass the papers
to the left and they are then read in turn. A prize
may be given to the one who wrote the best poetry.</p>

<p>Examples--</p>

<p>Question--Where did you get that hat?</p>

<p>Noun--Fair.</p>

<blockquote>"Where did you get that hat?"<br />
&#160;&#160;Said Shortie to Mr. Fat,<br />
"I stole it from the Fair,<br />
&#160;&#160;When I was leaving there."</blockquote>

<p>Question--Can you dance?</p>

<p>Noun--Day.</p>

<blockquote>"May-day! let us away!<br />
&#160;&#160;Can you dance?<br />
&#160;&#160;Here's your chance,<br />
On this lovely May-day."</blockquote>

<a name="163"></a>
<h2>ART GALLERY.</h2>

<p>Select copies of famous paintings, those familiar
to every one, and hang them around the room.</p>

<p>Neither the name of the painting nor of the artist
must be on it, only a number on each picture.</p>

<p>Provide the guests with pencil and paper and allow
a certain length of time, according to the number
of pictures, for guessing the names and artists.</p>

<a name="164"></a>
<h2>HUNTING FOR BOOK-TITLES.</h2>

<p>The hostess must prepare beforehand pictures, cut
from magazine advertisements and miscellaneous articles,
suggestive of the titles of books.</p>

<p>These are arranged around the room, some on tables,
some on the wall, and in any place, so all the guests
can see them. All the articles are numbered.</p>

<p>The guests are handed pencil and paper and the hostess
announces that all the articles represent the title
of some book and when guessed the names are to be
written opposite their corresponding numbers. Allow
half an hour for the hunt, and when the time is up
the hostess reads the correct list and the player
who has guessed the largest number correctly, deserves
a prize.</p>

<p>Examples--A large bow of orange ribbon pinned
on a curtain, immediately suggests "A Bow of
Orange Ribbon," by Amelia Barr.</p>

<p>A picture of several boys suggests "Little Men,"
by Louisa M. Alcott.</p>

<p>A picture of Gen. Grant cut in half suggests "Half
a Hero."</p>

<h1>Part III.</h1>

<h3>Games for Special Days.</h3>

<a name="165"></a>
<h2>JACK FROST.</h2>

<p>Around Christmas and New Year's the children
will enjoy playing this. All form a circle; one, Jack
Frost, stands in the middle.</p>

<p>Jack Frost runs around inside the circle and touches
one child on her right hand, and goes back to his
place again. The child touched says: "Jack Frost
came this way," the child to her left says: "What
did he do?" No. 1 says: "He nipped my
right hand," (shaking her right hand). No. 2
tells No. 3 about Jack Frost, each doing as No. 1 did,
and thus it goes down the circle, until back to No.
1 again.</p>

<p>Jack Frost then steps out and bites her left hand,
and now both hands are shaking; thus each time Jack
Frost nips some part, that is shaking with the rest,
until the children are hopping up and down, and shaking
all over.</p>

<a name="166"></a>
<h2>MAGIC CANDLES.</h2>

<p>Arrange twelve candles, one for each month, in a row
about two feet apart. Have the candles different colors
suggestive of the months they represent, such as,
green for March and red for December.</p>

<p>The children form in line and one at a time jump over
the candles, which are lighted.</p>

<p>If a light goes out the child who has just jumped
will have bad luck in that month which the candle
represents.</p>

<a name="167"></a>
<h2>THE LUCKY OR UNLUCKY SLIPPER.</h2>

<p>A slipper is waved three times over the head and then
thrown on the floor.</p>

<p>If the toe be toward the player, good luck is coming.
If the heel, bad luck is in store, and if it rests
on its side, there is hope for something better.</p>

<a name="168"></a>
<h2>CAKES.</h2>

<p>On the sixth of January, Twelfth Night was celebrated
in the olden times. Then all the pastry cooks did
their finest baking and decked their windows with
marvelous productions of cakes.</p>

<p>If a party is being planned for this day invite your
guests to come dressed as cakes. Just the ladies will
do this and the men can wear miniature cooking utensils
if they choose.</p>

<p>Give each lady a number and each man a pencil and
slip of paper. The men must guess what cakes the ladies
represent and write their answers with the corresponding
numbers on the paper.</p>

<p>When all the cakes have been guessed the correct list
is read by the hostess and the one having the largest
number of correct answers may be awarded a prize.</p>

<p>A prize may also be awarded to the lady attired in
the best representation. One dressed in dark brown
would suggest "chocolate cake"; another
in orange-colored cheesecloth, "orange cake";
another with wreaths of raisins, currants and citron,
suggest "fruit cake"; while one in just
a plain dress with no signs suggestive of any cake
may be "lady cake"; another carrying a
hammer and pounding it whenever she saw fit, suggests
"pound cake."</p>

<a name="169"></a>
<h2>VALENTINES.</h2>

<p>When inviting the guests for a valentine party, request
each one to bring an original valentine addressed
to one of the guests. As the guests arrive, the hostess
collects the valentines, being careful to keep those
addressed to ladies in one pile, and those addressed
to gentlemen in another.</p>

<p>The hostess then hands each one a valentine, giving
the gentlemen those addressed to the ladies and the
ladies those for the gentlemen. The valentines are
then read aloud and a jolly time will be the result.</p>

<p>A prize may be awarded for the best valentine, the
brightest and most witty.</p>

<a name="170"></a>
<h2>INITIAL COMPLIMENTS.</h2>

<p>Each gentleman is handed a slip of paper with the
name of a lady guest on it. The gentlemen are then
requested, one at a time, to go to their respective
ladies, giving each a compliment, every word of which
begins with the initial letter of the lady's
first name.</p>

<p>As each lady is addressed by a gentleman, she replies,
using the initial letter of his name in her answer.</p>

<p>Votes are taken as to the best compliment and answer
and a simple prize may be awarded the pair who obtained
the most votes.</p>

<a name="171"></a>
<h2>HEART HUNT.</h2>

<p>Cut out of red, white, blue, yellow and green paper
hearts of all shapes and sizes, then cut each heart
into four pieces and scatter these all over the room,
on the floor, chairs, tables, behind pictures, etc.</p>

<p>Allow a certain length of time for the hunt, and when
all the pieces have been collected, request each guest
to put his pieces together and see how many whole
hearts of the same color he has collected.</p>

<p>The white heart counts 1; the blue, 2; the yellow,
3; the green, 4; and the red, 5. The one scoring the
greatest number of points is the winner of hearts
and deserves a prize. A booby prize may be awarded
the one who has only broken hearts.</p>

<a name="172"></a>
<h2>HEART PRICKS.</h2>

<p>A large heart made of some red material, (flannel
or cheesecloth) is pinned securely to a sheet, which
may be stretched on the wall or door. In the center
of the large red heart is a small white heart, either
sewed or pinned on.</p>

<p>Each guest is given an arrow of white cloth with a
pin in one end. When everything is ready the hostess
blindfolds the guests one at a time, and standing
a certain distance from the heart, starts them in
the right direction.</p>

<p>Each one endeavors to pin his arrow on the heart;
the one pinning it nearest to the middle of the white
heart wins the game.</p>

<a name="173"></a>
<h2>VALENTINE PUZZLE.</h2>

<p>Select five good paper valentines. Paste each on a
piece of cardboard and cut into small pieces. Have
five small tables in the room and place a puzzle on
each. If the company is small, assign five persons
to a table, if larger, use your own judgment.</p>

<p>Each one at the table takes his turn, trying to put
the valentine together in its proper shape. Each player
is timed, and the one who succeeds in putting it together
in the shortest time is the winner.</p>

<p>If desired, the players can go from one table to the
other; the one who succeeds in putting the most puzzles
together out of the five, is the winner.</p>

<a name="174"></a>
<h2>HEARTS AND MITTENS.</h2>

<p>Cut out of red cardboard half as many hearts and mittens
as you expect in your company.  Out of blue cardboard
cut hearts and mittens for the rest of the company.
Number them so every heart has its corresponding mitten.
 Attach strings or ribbons to each and place them in
a basket.</p>

<p>Each guest takes the end of a string and pulls out
his heart or mitten, as the case may be. Each one
then hunts for his partner.</p>

<p>When all are paired off, a circle is formed and someone
strikes up a lively march. Whenever the music stops,
all the ladies stand still, and the gentlemen move
up one. This goes on until everyone has had a different
partner, and finally, when the original one comes,
there is a grand march before the circle breaks up.</p>

<a name="175"></a>
<h2>RIVEN HEARTS.</h2>

<p>Another way of securing partners for the evening is
as follows: Suspend two large hearts made of either
white or red paper from the ceiling, several feet
apart. Make a hole in each, through which are hung
the ends of long strings. The ladies hold the strings
on one side and the gentlemen on the other.</p>

<p>When the hostess gives a signal, all pull on their
strings. Thus the hearts are riven and partners are
found holding the ends of the same string.</p>

<a name="176"></a>
<h2>PROPOSALS.</h2>

<p>As the guests assemble for the Valentine party, give
each gentleman a slip of paper bearing the name of
a woman, and the ladies, the name of some man, noted
in fiction as lovers.  Thus the one who has Romeo
hunts for the lady who has Juliet on her paper.</p>

<p>When all know who their partners are, the ladies must
evade every attempt on the part of the gentlemen of
proposing to them during the evening.</p>

<p>A prize is given to the gentleman who has succeeded
in proposing, and to the girl who has alluded all
efforts of her partner by her wit and ingenuity.</p>

<p>Another way is to have the proposals progressive.
 Every gentleman must propose to every lady before
the evening is over. The ladies use every effort they
can to prevent them from "coming to the point."
The man making the most offers receives the prize.
The lady receiving the fewest declarations receives
a prize.</p>

<a name="177"></a>
<h2>WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY.</h2>

<p>For a party on this day, the room should be decorated
with flags, hatchets, etc., and red, white, and
blue bunting, so as to add a patriotic air to everything.</p>

<p>A picture of Washington may be cut in many pieces
for a puzzle. The one who succeeds in putting the
picture together in the shortest time receives a prize,
which may be a large picture of Washington.</p>

<p>A cherry tree may be represented by using a branch
of any tree and decorating it with small candy cherries.
If these cannot be obtained, any kind of candy may
be wrapped in red tissue paper and tied to the branch.
The players are blindfolded one at a time, given a
pair of scissors, and requested to "cut off
a cherry."</p>

<p>To add to the fun small paper hatchets may be hidden
around the room for the players to find, as in a peanut
hunt.</p>

<p>The head of a hatchet may be drawn on a sheet which
is tacked to the wall, and the players are given cloth
handles which they are to pin to the sheet while blindfolded.
The one who succeeds in pinning his handle nearest
to the proper place may be awarded a prize.</p>

<a name="178"></a>
<h2>APRIL FIRST.</h2>

<p>For an April Fool's Day gathering, ask each
guest to come prepared to do some sleight of hand
trick. When all are assembled, each one in turn performs
his trick. A vote is taken for the most clever and
a prize is awarded.</p>

<p>Each one present endeavors to fool someone else during
the evening. The one who has not been fooled once
during the whole evening receives a prize; the one
who is fooled the most times is given a prize, too.</p>

<a name="179"></a>
<h2>EASTER EGG RACE.</h2>

<p>Color an even number of eggs, half the number one
color, the other half, another. Place all the eggs
of one color on the floor in a line at intervals of
one foot. At the end of the line put a basket. Form
a similar line, a little distance from the other,
of the remaining eggs. For convenience, we will say
one line is of green eggs, the other of pink.</p>

<p>Choose two players as leaders, who select their sides.
One side chooses the green row, and the other, the
pink. Two, one player from each side, play at a time.</p>

<p>When all is ready the two leaders stand by their respective
rows, each is given a large spoon, and when told to
"go," each one spoons up the eggs, one
at a time, and carries them to the basket at the end
of the line. The one who succeeds in spooning up all
his eggs first wins for his side.</p>

<p>Thus each player in turn works for his side until
all have had a chance and the side whose players were
the most successful is the winning side.</p>

<a name="180"></a>
<h2>SUSPENDED EGGS.</h2>

<p>After an egg hunt, several eggs may be gathered together
and a string or ribbon run through each and hung in
different lengths from a chandelier. Candy eggs and
little baskets of eggs may be suspended, too. Place
a tablecloth or sheet underneath to prevent the carpet
from being spoiled by the downfall.</p>

<p>Each child in turn is blindfolded and given a cane
with which to strike the suspended eggs. Whatever
is knocked down is his. If he fails to knock something
down the first time, he may have another turn.</p>

<a name="181"></a>
<h2>EGG RACE.</h2>

<p>Give each child a tablespoon and a hard-boiled egg.
The children form in line and one is the leader. Each
one holds the spoon with the egg in its bowl at arm's
length and hops on one foot, following wherever the
leader leads them.</p>

<p>The leader may take them up stairs, over stools, and
any place hard to reach on one foot.  To drop the
egg or rest on both feet prevents one from continuing
in the game. She must stay out until the next time
round.</p>

<a name="182"></a>
<h2>ROLLING EGGS.</h2>

<p>Mark on the table, or on the floor, if preferred,
with chalk, four parallel lines, eight or ten feet
long, and four or five inches apart. Thus there are
three narrow spaces. At the end of each space make
a circle, numbering the middle one 10, and the other
two, 5. The middle space is marked 3, and the other
two, 1.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to have each child roll
five eggs, one at a time, down the middle space to
the circles at the ends. If the egg goes into the
middle circle, it counts 10, but if it stops in the
middle space, it counts only 3, and so on, counting
the number of the place where it stops.</p>

<p>Tally is kept for each child, the one scoring the
most points wins the game.</p>

<a name="183"></a>
<h2>BUNNY'S EGG.</h2>

<p>On a sheet draw a rough-sketch of a good-sized rabbit,
the regular Easter bunny, standing on its hind legs,
and holding its paws as if it were carrying an egg.</p>

<p>Stretch the sheet on the wall and tack it firmly in
place. Cut eggs out of different colored cloth to
represent Easter eggs. The eggs should be as large
as the space between the rabbit's paws. In each
egg stick a pin.</p>

<p>Blindfold the children in turn and give each an egg,
which is to be pinned on the sheet, and right in "Bunny's"
arms, if possible.</p>

<p>As the children take their turn, no matter how straight
on the way they were started, "Bunny"
will be surrounded with eggs, until some child pins
the egg in his arms. This child deserves a prize.</p>

<a name="184"></a>
<h2>JULY FOURTH.</h2>

<p>Aside from the enjoyment of firecrackers, etc.,
there are a few games to amuse the children on this
day. If a party has been planned for the Fourth, the
rooms should be appropriately decorated for the occasion.</p>

<p>As soon as all the children arrive choose two leaders,
who in turn select sides. A line is marked on the
floor and the sides stand on each side of this boundary
line. A few feet from the line on each side is placed
an American flag. Any flag can be made to stand up
by placing the end of the stick securely in the hole
of an empty spool. Each leader guards his own flag.</p>

<p>The children endeavor to secure their opponents'
flag. If a leader tags anyone who crosses the boundary
and comes too near the flag, that child is out of
the game. However, if one does succeed in capturing
the other's flag, and carries it over the boundary
into his side, that side is victorious.</p>

<a name="185"></a>
<h2>FLAGS OF ALL NATIONS.</h2>

<p>Flags of all nations are collected and displayed around
the room. Each one is numbered. The guests are given
pencil and paper with numbers down the left hand side.</p>

<p>Opposite each number the guest writes the names of
the country which the flag bearing the corresponding
number stands for. Allow a certain length of time
for guessing, then collect the papers, read the correct
list, and correct the papers. Prizes may be awarded,
but the satisfaction of having guessed the most seems
to be enough reward.</p>

<a name="186"></a>
<h2>OUR FLAG.</h2>

<p>Other games for the Fourth are as follows: Each child
is given a piece of white paper or cardboard 6-1/2
by 3-1/2 inches in size. All sit around a table on
which are red and blue paper and a pile of stars by
each one's place.  Scissors and a bottle of mucilage
are handy.  The children are given a certain length
of time in which to make their flags, putting the
blue field and stars and stripes correctly on their
pieces of cardboard. The one who completes his flag
first deserves a prize.</p>

<p>Suspend a bell in a doorway low enough for the children
to reach. The children stand about ten feet away and
each in turn throws a beanbag, endeavoring to make
the "liberty bell," as it is called, ring.
Those who succeed in making it ring receive little
bells as a reward.</p>

<p>The contents of several boxes of torpedoes may be
emptied and hidden around the room.  The children
hunt for them, and have a jolly time shooting them
off after the hunt is over.</p>

<a name="187"></a>
<h2>HALLOWE'EN.</h2>

<p>A Hallowe'en party is probably the only gathering
where the stiffness and formality entirely disappear.
Every one is in for a good time, and should be dressed
in old clothes ready to try all sorts of experiments.</p>

<p>Decorate the room appropriately with pumpkin jack-o'-lanterns,
greens, weird lights, and strings of peppers, if possible.
Mirrors should be in profusion. Effective lights may
be made from cucumbers by scraping out the inside
and cutting holes in the rind for eyes and nose, and
placing a candle in each.</p>

<p>Persons dressed as ghosts may receive the guests and
usher them into the room where the fun is to be. As
soon as a person enters, the hostess, who is not a
ghost, blindfolds the victim, and those already in
the room take turns shaking hands with him. He has
to guess who each person is. It is marvellous how
many mistakes will be made, even if the guests are
the best of friends.</p>

<a name="188"></a>
<h2>HALLOWE'EN STORIES.</h2>

<p>There are several ways of telling ghastly stories
on Hallowe'en. Have a large ball of different
colored yarn handy and before the midnight hour, turn
out the lights, and ask all the players to sit in a
circle. The hostess, holding the ball of yarn, begins
by telling some weird story, unwinding the yarn as
she proceeds, until she comes to a different color,
and then she tosses the ball to someone in the circle,
and that one must proceed with the story until she
comes to a different color. It is then tossed to another,
and so on, until the ball is unwound and the story
ended.</p>

<p>Another way, more ghastly still, is to give each guest
a saucer in which is a handful of salt and some alcohol.
Each one in turn lights the contents of the saucer
and tells some ghost story, continuing until all the
alcohol is burned, and no longer. The stories may be
lively or sad.</p>

<a name="189"></a>
<h2>HALLOWE'EN FATES.</h2>

<p>For obtaining partners, fill a pumpkin rind with nuts,
which have been opened, had the meat taken out, some
token of the fate placed inside, and glued together
again with a ribbon attached to each. Those drawing
nuts having the same colored ribbon are partners.
The one whose nut has a ring in, is to be married
next; if a coin, he is to be the most wealthy; if
a thimble, a spinster all her life.  The other nuts
may have slips of paper with prophecies written on
them.</p>

<p>A bag filled with nuts may be tied up tightly and
hung in a doorway. One of the players is blindfolded
and given a stick with which he is to hit the bag
as hard as he can, thus breaking it, and scattering
the nuts on the floor. The one who succeeds in gathering
the greatest number of nuts will be the luckiest during
the year.</p>

<p>Fill two large pans with sawdust. Bury in one pan
pieces of paper bearing a rhyme about one's
future, these can be about the ladies for the men
to draw, and in the other pan verses for the ladies
to draw. The papers are folded up tightly. The ladies
and gentlemen take turns putting in their thumbs.
As soon as a verse is found it is read aloud.</p>

<p>Example for the men to draw:</p>

<blockquote>"Medium height, eyes of blue,<br />
Charming girl is awaiting you."</blockquote>

<p>For the ladies:</p>

<blockquote>"Tall and slight, with red hair,<br />
Fond of walking and fresh air."</blockquote>

<a name="190"></a>
<h2>SOME MORE FATES.</h2>

<p>In addition to the regulation "bobbing for apples,"
"floating needles," and throwing the apple
peel over the head, there are many other amusements
of prophecy.</p>

<p>In a doorway a porti&#232;re of apples may be hung. Apples
are strung on strings of various lengths. The tallest
guests endeavor to bite those swinging on the longest
strings stooping in the attempt, while the shorter
ones reach for those above. The one who succeeds in
eating the whole of his apple just by biting it, will
never want for anything.</p>

<p>A horseshoe is hung in a doorway. Each guest is given
three small apples. Each in turn tries to throw the
apples, one at a time, through the horseshoe. If he
succeeds in sending all three through, he will always
be lucky during the coming year.</p>

<p>From the ceiling suspend a large pumpkin, on whose
rind all the letters of the alphabet have been burned
or painted. Twirl this quickly and each guest in turn
tries to stab some letter with a hatpin. The letter
which is pierced is the initial letter of one's
fate.</p>

<p>Another,--swing a wedding ring over a goblet
and repeat the alphabet slowly, the letter said as
the ring touches the glass is the initial of the future
wife or husband, as the case may be.</p>

<p>This same ring may be suspended from the ceiling,
at a convenient distance from the floor.  Whoever
succeeds in running a pencil through it while walking
towards it, without stopping, is the next to be married.</p>

<a name="191"></a>
<h2>WATER CHARM.</h2>

<p>Place three bowls on a table, one containing clear
water, another soapy or muddy water, and the third
one empty.</p>

<p>Blindfold the players one at a time, and lead them
to the bowls, (whose positions are changed each time)
to put their fingers in one of them.</p>

<p>If a player touches the clear water, he will be happily
married; if the soapy water, he will marry a widow;
and if he puts his finger in the empty bowl, he will
never marry.</p>

<p>For knowing the occupation of the future one, there
are several ways. Articles suggestive of different
trades may be buried in flour, and the players in
turn take a spoonful out of the dish and see what
they can find. If not successful the first time, they
may have a second trial.</p>

<p>Another way is to melt lead and then drop in into
cold water, and the form it takes will suggest the
trade of the future husband. Sometimes the forms are
intricate, but if they suggest any trade, that is the
real one. If it flattens out and looks like a book,
an author will be the fate; if in tiny pieces, like
particles of dirt, a farmer will be suggested, and
so on.</p>

<a name="192"></a>
<h2>OVER THE CIDER MUGS.</h2>

<p>By each place at the table place a mug of sweet cider,
a small bunch of matches, two candles, and a slip
of paper with a pencil.</p>

<p>Before the refreshments are served, when all are seated,
the hostess announces that as she counts twenty-five
slowly, each guest is to write a wish on the paper,
light a candle, burn the paper in the light, letting
the ashes fall into the cider, and drink the contents
of the mug, ashes and all. All who succeed in doing
this before twenty-five is counted, will have their
wishes granted.</p>

<p>Later, ask each guest to light both candles, naming
each after a sweetheart, and allow them to burn as
long as they will. The candle which burns longest
shows which one will prove most faithful.</p>

<a name="193"></a>
<h2>SHIPS OF FATE.</h2>

<p>Prepare as many half shells of walnuts as there are
guests. In each fasten a small candle with a drop
of the wax.</p>

<p>Fill a tub with water, and before sailing the boats,
the water should be agitated so as to have it wavy.
Two at a time may sail their boats, lighting the candles
as they are launched. The life of the owner is prophesied
by the seaworthy qualities of his ship.</p>

<p>If the storm overcomes the ship, the one whose it
is, will be wrecked by adversity. The ship sailing
across the tub signifies a long sea voyage, while
those remaining by the side show that the person loves
home better.</p>

<p>If the two ships stay together throughout the trip,
the couple owning them will have a happy marriage.
If they bump together, that signifies a quarrel, and
if they sail in opposite directions, each person will
lead a single life.</p>

<a name="194"></a>
<h2>CAKE WITH CANDLES.</h2>

<p>A large cake with as many different colored candles
on it as there are guests, is passed around, and each
one takes a piece of it, with the candle too, choosing
whatever color they wish.</p>

<p>As the cake passes from one to the other, the hostess
reads the following prophecies, having prepared them
beforehand to suit the company:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Bright and cheery, candle red,<br />
The year is here in which you wed."</p>

<p>"If your candle green should be,<br />
You will find your love at sea."</p>

<p>"Lonely, hopeless, spinster she,<br />
If white candle hers should be."</p>

<p>"Happy he with candle blue,<br />
Thy sweetheart is ever true."</p>

<p>"She who holds a candle yellow,<br />
Marries now a jealous fellow."</p>
</blockquote>

<a name="195"></a>
<h2>HUNT THE SQUIRREL.</h2>

<p>To amuse the children after the Thanksgiving dinner,
ask them all to join hands and form a ring. One is
chosen out and is given a nut which he is to drop
behind some child. As he walks around the outside of
the ring he says:</p>

<blockquote>"Hunt the squirrel in the woods,<br />
I lost him, I found him.<br />
Hunt the squirrel in the woods,<br />
I lost him, I found him.<br />
I won't catch you, and I won't
catch you,<br />
But I will catch you."</blockquote>

<p>As he says the last line, he drops the nut behind
some child. That one must pick it up, and run around
the circle, trying to reach his place before the other
one gets there. If he fails, he is out and the game
continues as before.</p>

<a name="196"></a>
<h2>CHRISTMAS TREE.</h2>

<p>A novel amusement for children at Christmas time is
to trim a Christmas tree when blindfolded. Stand a
small tree at one end of the room, ready to be trimmed.
Have all the ornaments on a table near at hand, ready
to be put on the tree.</p>

<p>Blindfold the children one at a time, lead them to
the table to take their pick. The first thing touched
must be taken, and after turning the child around
three times start him straight toward the tree.</p>

<p>When he reaches the tree, he must wire the ornament,
or whatever he had, in place. Some older person can
be ready to turn the tree around, as it will be trimmed
only on one side, if not. The children can have as
may turns as they wish until the tree is trimmed.</p>

<a name="197"></a>
<h2>CHRISTMAS GUESSES.</h2>

<p>Suspend a large bunch of mistletoe from one of the
chandeliers. The children, one at a time, stand under
the mistletoe, and guess how many berries there are
on it. The berries are counted when all have guessed.
The one coming the nearest receives a prize.</p>

<p>While watching the Christmas tree, after the presents
have been distributed, some one says, "I see
something on the Christmas tree which commences with
T. What is it?" Many guesses are given, the one
who says "Tinsel," has guessed correctly,
and it is his turn to give a guess, which may commence
with P and C.  Pop-corn is easily guessed, and so
on, until everything has been guessed.</p>

<a name="198"></a>
<h2>CHRISTMAS WREATH.</h2>

<p>Suspend a large Christmas wreath in a doorway at a
convenient height from the floor. Prepare in advance
"snowballs," made of cotton batting covered
with white tissue paper.</p>

<p>The players stand about eight feet from the wreath,
and take turns, one at a time. Each is given three
"snowballs," and the one who succeeds
in throwing all three, one at a time, through the wreath,
is given the prize.</p>

<p>To make it more exciting, sides may be chosen, and
each one of the three snowballs numbered, one being
5, the other, 10, and the third, 20. If the ball numbered
5 goes through, it counts 5 for that player's
side. If it does not go through, it is a loss, and
so on. The side scoring the most points is victorious.</p>

<a name="199"></a>
<h2>CHRISTMAS CANDLES.</h2>

<p>A small tree is placed on a table. The candles are
lighted. Blindfold the players, one at a time, turn
around three times, and allow each to take five steps
toward the tree. Then he must blow as hard as he can,
endeavoring to blow out all the lights, if possible.
The one who succeeds in extinguishing the most receives
a prize.</p>

<p>Another amusement is playing "The night before
Christmas" like "Stagecoach." Give
each child the name of some part of Santa Claus'
outfit, the sleigh, the reindeer, etc. The hostess
then reads the well-known story, "The Night
Before Christmas." As she mentions the names,
the players having them, rise, turn around, and sit
down again. When she mentions Santa Claus, all change
places, and she tries to secure a seat. The one left
out continues the story, and so on, until completed.</p>

<a name="200"></a>
<h2>A GAME WITHIN A GAME.</h2>

<p>While the children are waiting on Christmas for their
presents, or dinner, or whenever the time seems to
drag, suggest that each one think up the best game
he knows.</p>

<p>Give each child a pencil and a card on which the game
and the name of the child who thought of it are written.
Each one in turn tells his game and all the children
play it.  When all have had a turn, and each game
has been played, the children look over their lists
and choose the game they liked best. The originator
of the most popular one receives a prize.</p>

<a name="201"></a>
<h2>TOSS THE GOODIES.</h2>

<p>The children form a square, each one holding the sides
of an old tablecloth or piece of sheeting. In the
center of this is placed a pile of nuts, candies,
raisins, fruits, and all sorts of goodies. When a
signal is given, the children all together toss the
cloth up and down, singing:</p>

<blockquote>"Toss the goodies up and down,<br />
Up and down, up and down,<br />
Toss the goodies up and down,<br />
Goodies for you and me."</blockquote>

<p>When the last line is sung, an extra large toss is
made and thus all the goodies fly to all parts of
the room. The children then all scramble around picking
them up and having a jolly time.</p>

<a name="202"></a>
<h2>SNOWBALLS.</h2>

<p>A pretty idea for concealing Christmas presents for
the children is to make a lot of snowballs out of
white tissue paper and cotton batting, and concerting
the gifts inside.</p>

<p>Pile all these snowballs under the tree, and when
the time comes for distributing them, the mother,
or some older person tosses them, one at a time, to
the children, who are standing at distance eagerly
waiting for them.</p>

<p>As the children catch them they step out of line to
leave room for others until all have received one.
Then all the balls are opened and the presents disclosed.</p>

<a name="203"></a>
<h2>DECKING SANTA CLAUS.</h2>

<p>Santa, who has been invited to the party, after being
introduced to all the children, sits at the end of
the room.</p>

<p>The children are blindfolded one at a time, and after
being turned around three or four times, are told
to walk up to him, and place on his head their own
caps, which they had received in bonbons just before.</p>

<p>The child who succeeds in decking Santa Claus with
his own cap may receive a little prize. </p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
