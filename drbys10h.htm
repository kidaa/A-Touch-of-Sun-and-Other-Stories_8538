<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">I</span>t</span> was the fourth day of July of the year
1776.  There was great excitement in all
of the colonies of <span class="name.state">America</span> at that time, for on
this day the representatives of the people, gathered together in the city of <span class="name.city"><span class="name.city">Philadelphia</span></span>, were
to decide whether the Declaration of Independence, already drawn up, should be adopted
and signed.  In <span class="name.city"><span class="name.city">Philadelphia</span></span>, as may well be
supposed, the excitement was so intense that
the people suspended business.  They thronged
the streets, walking up and down, talking excitedly, and waiting, waiting for the decision
to be made, the determination that would mean
so much to them.</p>

<p>The people talked and gesticulated, and there
was considerable arguing, some contending that
the Declaration of Independence would be
adopted and signed, others that it would not.</p>



<p>&#8220;Look, here it is almost evening,&#8221; contended
one of these latter, &#8220;and nothing has been done
yet.  If they were going to adopt the Declaration it would have been done before this.  The
delay means that it will not be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are taking their time to it, that is all,&#8221;
replied the others.  &#8220;It is a most serious matter
and not to be taken up hastily and without due
thought.  They will adopt and sign the Declaration of Independence before the day is gone,
see if they don't!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>, two patriot youths,
brothers, from about three miles over in New
Jersey, who had come to the city to hear the
news, listening eagerly, were thrilled by the
excitement and interest shown on every side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope they will adopt the Declaration of
Independence, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;I'm sure they
will, aren't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they will, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  I hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah, they won't do nothin' uv the kind, <span class="name.char">Dick
Dare</span>!&#8221; cried a sneering voice at their side, and
turning, the Dare youths saw <span class="name.char">Zeke Boggs</span> and
<span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span>, the sons of two Tory neighbors,
standing there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uv course they won't,&#8221; added <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span>.
&#8220;They don't darst.  They know that ef they do,
they'll git into trouble with King George.  They
won't ring no old Liberty Bell to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they just will!&#8221; cried <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>, who
was an excitable, impulsive youth.  &#8220;They'll
ring it pretty soon, <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span>, and they aren't
afraid of your old king, not a bit of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What's thet!  Don't ye dare speak disrespectfully uv the king!&#8221; snarled <span class="name.char">Zeke Boggs</span>,
making a threatening motion with his fist.  &#8220;Ef
ye do, why et'll be the worse fur ye, that's all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>, who was the elder of the
brothers, a handsome, manly youth of eighteen
years, seized <span class="name.char">Zeke</span> by the wrist, and pushed him
back, at the same time saying quietly, yet
firmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, <span class="name.char">Zeke</span>.  Don't go making any
threats.  You and <span class="name.char">Lem</span> go about your business,
and don't interfere with <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We'll go where we please,&#8221; snarled <span class="name.char">Zeke</span>,
who was a vicious youth of about <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> age, as
was <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span> also.  &#8220;An' we'll stay heer ef
we want to, too, <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>, an' ye can't he'p
yerself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's all right,&#8221; calmly; &#8220;you can stay here,
I suppose, if you want to, but you will have to
behave yourselves and attend to your own business.  If you try to interfere with <span class="name.char">Tom</span>
and I, or to bully us, you will wish you hadn't
stayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is thet so?&#8221; sneeringly.  &#8220;Whut'll ye do,
<span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>, hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, whut'll ye do?&#8221; cried <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span>, pushing forward and facing <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> confronted him quickly, and met his
angry glare unflinchingly.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> was only sixteen years of age, but he was well-built and
athletic for his age, and was moreover as brave
as a lion, though somewhat quick-tempered and
impulsive.  He put out his left hand and,
placing it against <span class="name.char">Lem's</span> chest, pushed him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span>,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Just you
stand back.  One at a time talking with <span class="name.char">Dick</span> is
enough.  You talk to me, if you want to talk to
anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span> was a hot-tempered youth also,
and suddenly his rage flared to the surface.  He
didn't relish being pushed back by <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, and
quick as a flash, he gave the patriot youth a
smart slap on the cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;That thet, an' l'arn to keep yer han's offen
people!&#8221; he snarled.</p>



<p>The blow was with the flat of the hand, and
while it smarted, it did not hurt much to speak
of, but it was sufficient to start impulsive <span class="name.char">Tom
Dare</span> into action, and quick as a flash out shot
his fist.  It caught <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span> between the eyes
and knocked him down flat on his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, see how you like that!&#8221; exclaimed
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>, his eyes flashing.  &#8220;I guess that next
time you'll think once or twice before you slap
me in the face!&#8221;</p>

<p>With an angry exclamation, <span class="name.char">Zeke Boggs</span>
struck at <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>, but that youth was on his
guard, and he warded the blow off, and striking
out himself, landed a blow on <span class="name.char">Zeke's</span> jaw, downing
him as neatly as had been the case with
Hicks.</p>

<p>Instantly a crowd gathered, many eagerly
asking what the trouble was about.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> explained that the two youths who had
been floored were Tories, and the sympathies
of the crowd were at once with <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,
more especially when they learned that the Tory
boys had picked the quarrel with the patriots.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did just right in knocking them down!&#8221;
was the cry, and so hostile were the looks,
actions and words of the crowd, that <span class="name.char">Zeke</span> and
<span class="name.char">Lem</span> on scrambling to their feet, did not renew
the fight.  They shook their fists at <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, however, and muttered threats, as they
moved away through the crowd declaring that
they would get even with <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>The patriot youths received the congratulations and commendations of the people in their
vicinity with becoming modesty, and a little
later moved on up the street.</p>

<p>They walked about for an hour or more, after
that, and then took up their station as near the
old State House as they could.  There was such
an immense crowd there that it was impossible
to get within half a block of the building.  In
the steeple of the State House was a bell, and
the old bell-ringer sat beside it, waiting for the
moment when his son, stationed below, should
give him word that the Declaration had
been adopted, when he would ring the bell.  He
had been stationed there since morning, waiting, waiting, and as the day wore away and
still the word to ring came not, he shook his
head and muttered that they would never reach
a favorable conclusion.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken, for when evening was
almost at hand, his son came rushing out of the
State House and called up eagerly and excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;They've done it, father!  They've adopted
and signed the Declaration of Independence!
Ring the bell!  Ring it, father!  Ring the bell!
Ring it—quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a glad cry, the old man leaped up, forgetting his rheumatism in his excitement and
delight, and seizing the great iron clapper,
swung it back and forth against the sides of the
great brass bell, thus causing it to do what by
a strange coincidence the inscription on its side
said it was to do, viz.:  &#8220;Proclaim liberty
throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants
thereof.&#8221;</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 1.2em;">Waylaid on the Road</h2>



<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">A</span>s</span> the deep tones of the old bell died away
on the evening air a great shout of delight went up from the people on the streets.
They leaped and danced for joy.  They tossed
their hats in the air.  They shouted and sang.
Many wept for joy.  It was an exciting, a thrilling manifestation.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span> were not a whit behind
any in their expressions of delight.  They
shouted for joy, and then in the excess of their
happiness they threw their arms around each
other in a bearlike hug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, I'm so glad!&#8221; cried <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;I never
was so happy in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  This is the most joyous hour
of my life!  How delighted father will be when
we go home and tell him that it is settled, that
the Declaration of Independence is a real and
determined fact!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It will please him more than anything else in
the world, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then lifting up his voice the patriot youth
cried out loudly, his voice ringing clear as the
notes of a bugle:</p>

<p>&#8220;Down with the king!  Long live Liberty!
Long live <span class="name.char">Washington</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The excitement was even greater after that,
and instantly the cry was taken up on every
hand.  Thousands shouted aloud, in a thrilling,
triumphant roar:  &#8220;Down with the king!  Long
live Liberty!  Long live <span class="name.char">Washington</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>People leaped and danced, and shouted till
they were hoarse.  They were like crazy people,
but with them it was pure joy because of the
thought that they were to be free, to be their
own masters, independent of a tyrannical king.
They had reason to be joyous and happy.</p>

<p>It was certainly a great day for the American
people–without doubt the greatest in the history
of the greatest country on the face of the Globe.</p>

<p>After awhile, when the people had calmed
down to a considerable extent and were beginning to disperse to their homes, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom
Dare</span> set their faces homeward.  They were
soon at the river, and crossing on the ferry,
walked swiftly along the road.  They were
eager to get back and tell their father the glad,
the glorious news.</p>

<p>Part of the way the road led through a heavy
growth of timber, and as <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> were
making their way past this point, talking enthusiastically of what they had seen in the city,
and never thinking that danger might lurk
near, they were suddenly set upon by four
youths of about their own age–no others, in
fact, than <span class="name.char">Zeke Boggs</span>, <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span> and two other
Tory <span title="sympathizers">sympathisers</span> of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;We told ye we'd git even with ye!&#8221; hissed
<span class="name.char">Zeke Boggs</span>, as they hurled themselves upon
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;Ye thought ye was mighty
smart, there in <span class="name.city">Phillydelphy</span>, with ever'buddy
on yer side an' ag'in us, but heer its different
an' we'll beat ye till ye'll wish ye had never been
born!  Go fur 'em, fellers!&#8221; this last to his
companions.</p>

<p>The two patriot youths, although taken by
surprise, and outnumbered two to one, were yet
not dismayed, for they were brave lads, and
they fought the Tory youths with all their
might, so fiercely, in fact, that they held their
own remarkably well.  They knocked down
each of the four young Tories, and gave them a
thumping that they would likely remember for
some time.  Of course, they got hit a number of
times by the youths, but they did not mind it,
the smart of the blows only serving to make
them settle down to their work with increased
vim and determination, and the result was that
the Tory ruffians presently got enough of it, and
suddenly ceasing the attack and dashing in
among the trees at the roadside, disappeared
from view, leaving <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span> masters
of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew, that was warm work, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>!&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>, wiping his perspiring face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, so it was, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,&#8221; replied his brother.
&#8220;But I believe that we made it warmer for <span class="name.char">Zeke</span>
and his gang than they did for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think we did,&#8221; with a chuckle.  &#8220;Say,
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, they are better runners than fighters,
aren't they!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they are, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  They did some lively
sprinting, just now, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they won't be likely to attack us
again, soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hardly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> now resumed their journey
homeward, and reached there about half an
hour later.  It was still light enough to see their father
at work in the backyard, as they entered
the front gate.  They ran around the house at
the top of their speed, to halt a few moments
later in front of their father.</p>

<p>&#8220;They did it, father!&#8221; exclaimed <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, pantingly.  &#8220;They adopted and signed the Declaration of Independence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say you so, my son?&#8221; exclaimed <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>
joyously.  &#8220;Well, heaven be praised!  I am glad,
my sons; yes, very, very glad!  It means much
to everybody, and to young people like yourselves more than to older ones, for you have
practically the whole of your lives before you,
while we older people have already lived the
greater portion of the time allotted to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was wonderful, the interest and excitement shown by the people in <span class="name.city">Philadelphia</span>,
father!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;They were wild with delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt of it, my son.  And they had
reason to be delighted.  It is a great thing to
feel free and independent.  I feel wonderfully
relieved already.  I feel as if shackles had suddenly been stricken from my limbs, and I have
no doubt that is the way the majority of the
people look at the matter, so why should they
not feel joyous?&#8221;</p>

<p>The three then entered the house, <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>
having finished his work for the evening, and
<span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span> greeted her sons affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Declaration of Independence has been
adopted, wife,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>, joyously.  &#8220;The
die is cast.  There will be war now, undoubtedly,
and it will result in the independence of the
people of <span class="name.state">America</span>.  It cannot result otherwise,
for the people will fight to the death.  In the
words of <span class="name.char">Patrick Henry</span>, it will be with them,
&#8216;Give me liberty, or give me death!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad, <span class="name.char">Henry</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>.  &#8220;I am
glad, and almost sorry, as well, for–I am
afraid it will take you from me.  You will want
to enter the army, I am afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I must do so, wife,&#8221; earnestly.  &#8220;Every
man should step to the front and shoulder a
musket and fight for liberty.  Yes, I must go to
the war, mother.  I must join the Continental
Army at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared it,&#8221; sighed the woman.  &#8220;But, I
shall try to be brave and bear up well, for I
know that it is the right thing for you to do.
I would not want you to stay at home, when you
were needed at the front to help fight the minions of King George.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like my own true-hearted wife!&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>.  &#8220;I knew you would look at the
matter that way, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment there came a knock on the
back-door, and when <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span> opened it, she
saw a neighbor, <span class="name.char">Abe Boggs</span>, the father of <span class="name.char">Zeke</span>,
standing there.  This man was an avowed Tory,
who was vehement in his declarations of allegiance to the king, and who had been heard
often to viciously proclaim that all who were
not in favor of the king, were traitors and that
they ought to be hung.  Knowing this, and instinctively disliking the man because she knew
he was vicious and bad, <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare's</span> heart sank
when she saw who was standing there.</p>

<p>The fact was, that the Dares lived right in
the midst of a Tory neighborhood; that is the
six or seven nearest neighbors were adherents
of the king, and they neighbored among themselves, and would not have anything to do with
the Dares.  This did not bother the patriot
family, however, for they did not like the Tory
families anyway.  <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span> often met one or
more of the men, when going about his work,
however, and frequently he had arguments with
them.  As he was a brave man, and frank-spoken as he was brave, he always told the
Tories just what he thought of their king, and
thus he had angered them many times, and
they had learned to hate him.  Only his fearlessness, and the fact that he was known to be a
dangerous man to interfere with, had saved him
from rough treatment at the hands of the
Tories.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evenin', <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>,&#8221; said Boggs, ducking his head.  &#8220;Tell yer husban' to come out
here; we'd like to see 'im.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span> glanced out into the yard, and her
heart gave a leap, and then sank as she saw
several of their Tory neighbors sanding in a
group a few yards from the house.  She noted,
with a feeling of fear gripping her heart, that
two or three of them had rifles in their hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;W-what do you want, <span class="name.char">Mr. Boggs</span>?&#8221; she
asked, her voice trembling.  &#8220;My husband is
here, but–but–we were just going to eat
supper, and—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Supper can wait a few minutes, wife,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>.  &#8220;I'll see what neighbor Boggs wants.
Won't you come in, <span class="name.char">Abe</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we wanter see ye out here, Dare&#8221; replied the Tory.  &#8220;Come out uv doors.  We won't
keep ye but a minnet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, husband, be careful!&#8221; whispered <span class="name.char">Mrs.
Dare</span> in her husband's ear as he passed her.
&#8220;Don't anger them.  They have weapons in
their hands, and—&#8221;  With a smile and a reassuring glance <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span> passed on out, closing
the door behind him.  He had no fear whatever
of his Tory neighbors, and would have scoffed
at the idea of their trying to do him injury.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> were washing their faces and
hands and combing their hair, and did not know
anything about the coming of the Tories until
they entered the room where their mother was,
and then <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span> had been out in the yard
perhaps five minutes.  During this time <span class="name.char">Mrs.
Dare</span> had been on the anxious seat, so to speak.
She had been listening eagerly and anxiously,
fearing she might hear rifle-shots, or the sound
of a struggle, but no such sounds had come to
her hearing.  Still, she was not feeling very
much reassured when the boys entered the
room, and she told them about the coming of
<span class="name.char">Abe Boggs</span> and some more of the neighbors,
and how they had called <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span> out, on the
plea of wishing to speak to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He's been out there quite a while,&#8221; <span class="name.char">Mrs.
Dare</span> finished; &#8220;and I'm beginning to feel uneasy.  I wish you would go out and tell father
to come in, that supper is getting cold, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, mother,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and he
hastened to the door.  The truth was, that a
feeling of uneasiness had taken hold upon him
when he heard what his mother had to say about
the Tories, and, remembering the trouble he and
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> had had with <span class="name.char">Zeke Boggs</span> and his cronies
that afternoon in <span class="name.city">Philadelphia</span> and on the road
home, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was led to fear that the Tories
had called his father out of doors with evil
intent.</p>

<p>He opened the door and stepped quickly out,
and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, who had also been assailed with fears
for his father's safety, was close at his heels.
They looked all around, but to their surprise,
and to their alarm as well, there was no one in
sight.  Neither their father nor the Tories
could be seen anywhere.  It was so dark that the
youths could not see any very great distance
with distinctness, but they were confident that
there was nobody in the back yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;They're around in the front yard, likely,
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, but his tone lacked positiveness.  It was evident that he had fears that such
was not really the case.</p>

<p>The two hastened around the house, accompanied by their mother, who had followed them
to the door and had, like her sons, noted that
there was nobody to be seen.  And when they
reached the front yard, they saw it was the
same there:  Not a soul was in the front yard.
The Tories, and <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span> as well, had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, where can they be?&#8221; cried <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>,
almost at the weeping point.  &#8220;What have they
done with your father?  Oh, I am afraid they
have wrought him injury of some kind, sons!&#8221;</p>

<p>The youths were alarmed, but they pretended
that such was not the case, in order to reassure their mother.  They said that their father
was all right.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone with them, to see about something,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;You go back in the house,
mother, and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and I will go over to <span class="name.char">Mr.
Boggs</span> and see what has become of father.
Likely he is there.  You go in and stay with
Mary.  We won't be gone long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>; &#8220;but
hurry, for I shall be anxious till you get back
with your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>She entered the house, and <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>
hastened over to the Boggs home, which was
less than a quarter mile distant.  <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>
was not there, and <span class="name.char">Mrs. Boggs</span> said she did not
know where her husband was, that he had left
the house an hour or more before, saying he did
not know when he would be back.  Thanking
her for the information, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> hastened
to the homes of several of the neighboring
Tories in succession, and made inquiries regarding <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>, but with the same result as at the
Boggs home.  In none of the homes visited
were any of the men of the house, and the
women did not know where the men were.</p>

<p>Greatly worried now, but hoping they would
find their father at home when they got there,
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> hastened back, and as they approached the house, they caught sight of something white on the door.  When they reached
the door, they found it was a piece of paper, and
on taking this into the house discovered it was
a rudely scrawled note, signed by <span class="name.char">Abe Boggs</span>
and six of his Tory neighbors.  The note read
as follows:</p>

<p class="letter" style="margin-left: 2em;margin-top: .5em;margin-bottom: .25em">&#8220;To <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span> and rebel sons, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>:</p>

<p class="letter" style="margin-left: 2em;margin-top: .25em;margin-bottom: .5em">&#8220;We hev took <span class="name.char">Henry Dare</span> prisner.  He<br style="display: block" />

and <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>, hev a care!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, husband is a prisoner in the hands of the
<span class="name.nationality"><span class="name.nationality">British</span></span>!&#8221; wailed <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>.  &#8220;Oh, this is terrible, boys!  What shall we do?  Oh, what shall
we do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't be frightened, mother,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
soothingly.  &#8220;I don't think father is in any
danger.  He is a prisoner, true, but the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
don't kill prisoners, and sooner or later father
will escape–or be rescued.  That will be work
for <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and I, mother!&#8221; his eyes lighting up.
&#8220;We will make it our object in life to rescue
father and get him back home here, with you,
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor woman was not greatly comforted,
however, and she shook her head, at the same
time saying, in a hopeless tone of voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;What could you do, you are only a couple of
boys?  You could not possibly rescue father.
It is useless to think of such a thing.  Oh, I
greatly fear I shall never see my husband again
in this world!  Oh, those terrible, cowardly
Tories!&#8221;  The good woman gave way to an
outburst of uncontrollable grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you shall see father again, mother,&#8221; declared <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, decidedly.  &#8220;Don't worry.  He is
safe from personal harm, and sooner or later
we will succeed in getting him located and will
rescue him.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and I will make that our object in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, mother,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span> eagerly.  &#8220;We'll
join the patriot army, if need be, to further our
ends, and while fighting for Liberty and Independence, and aiding our country in that
manner, we will at the same time be on the lookout to find father and rescue him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that is what we will do,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.
&#8220;Father would have joined the patriot army if
he had not been captured and taken away by the
Tories, and now that he is not able to do that,
we will do it in his stead.  I know it is what
father would wish us to do, and as <span class="name.char">Tom</span> says, it
will give us a better chance to find and rescue
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my sons, my sons!  How can I spare
you, too?&#8221; murmured <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>.  &#8220;How can I
let you leave me, now that I have lost your dear
father!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be only temporary, mother.  You can
see, when you give the matter more thought,
that it is the best thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, darling,&#8221; acquiesced <span class="name.char">Mrs.
Dare</span>, &#8220;but it is hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>Throwing their arms about their mother's
neck, the youths kissed her, and presently she
grew more calm.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 1.2em;"><span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span> Brings Important News</h2>



<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">&#8220;O</span>h</span>, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, is it true that you and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> are
going to enter the army and fight for
liberty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is true, Elsie.  Aren't you glad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-yes, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Elsie Foster</span>, hesitatingly.  &#8220;I'm glad you are to be a soldier, but I–well, you might get killed you know, and–and–&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you care, Elsie?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Elsie Foster</span> was the daughter of <span class="name.char">Robert
Foster</span>, the nearest neighbor of the Dares.  <span class="name.char">Mr.
Foster</span> was a king's man, but he was different
from the other Tories of the neighborhood, in
that he was an honest, honorable man, and was
a friend of the Dares.  He had had nothing to
do with the capture of <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>, and was outspoken in his denunciation of his Tory neighbors for the deed they had committed.</p>



<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> had gone over to the Foster home to
borrow something for his mother, and had met
Elsie out in the yard, and the girl had greeted
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> as above.  The truth was that <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and
Elsie were great friends.  They were school-mates, and whenever there was anything going
on in the neighborhood, such as spelling schools,
skating parties, etc., <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was Elsie's companion.  Elsie was seventeen, and she had a
brother, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, he being her twin, and a sister,
Lucy, aged fifteen.  The three young folks of
the Dare family and the three of the Foster
family often got together of evenings and had a
pleasant time, but now that <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> were
going away to the war, it would break into this
arrangement.</p>

<p>When <span class="name.char">Dick</span> asked Elsie if she would care if he
should get killed in battle, she blushed and
looked confused at first, and then she looked
him frankly in the eyes and said, softly.  &#8220;You
know I would, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm glad to know that, Elsie,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
earnestly.</p>

<p>At this moment <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span> came running up.
He was a manly-looking youth, and was lively
and jolly as a rule.  But now he was very sober-looking, for he realized that <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, whose father
had been captured by the Tories only the day
before, was in no mood for jollity.  There was
an eager expression on <span class="name.char">Ben's</span> face, however,
and after greeting <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really going to join the Continental
army, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, you and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, say, I'm going to go with you,&#8221; declared <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>!&#8221; exclaimed Elsie.  &#8220;What will
father say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father's all right, sis.  He is a king's man,
everybody knows that, but he is reasonable, and
lets other people think as they like.  He knows
that I'm a patriot, and he won't object.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick's</span> face lighted up, for he liked <span class="name.char">Ben</span> very
much, and the idea of having him along was a
pleasing one.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be fine, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;But I
wouldn't want you to do anything contrary to
the wishes of your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be all right,&#8221; <span class="name.char">Ben</span> assured him.
&#8220;He won't care, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness, what will Mary do if you go
away?&#8221; said Elsie.  <span class="name.char">Ben</span> seemed to think as
much of Mary Dare as <span class="name.char">Dick</span> did of Elsie, and he
flushed slightly at his sister's words, and then
retorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess she'll do about the same thing that
you will when <span class="name.char">Dick</span> goes–go up into the attic
and have a good cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're a mean brother,&#8221; said Elsie in pretended anger, lifting her hand as if to slap him,
&#8220;and if it wasn't that I will likely soon lose you,
I would box your ears soundly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked awhile, and then <span class="name.char">Dick</span> attended to
the errand that had brought him there and went
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we will have company when we go
to war, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>&#8221; he said to his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; with an interested ear.  &#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't mean it, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.  He just told me he intends to accompany us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But–his father's a Tory!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but he is a reasonable man, and <span class="name.char">Ben</span>
says that he will not object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that will be fine.  I'd like to have <span class="name.char">Ben</span>
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I.  And I guess he'll go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope he will.  He's such a lively, jolly fellow that he is good company, and will help keep
us from getting homesick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, that we will be kept too busy
to get homesick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think there will be lots of fighting,
then?  You feel certain that there will be war?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;War has really existed for more than a year,
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  You know the battle of Lexington was
fought April the nineteenth of last year, and
that was the first battle of the Revolution.  And
since that there has been more or less skirmishing between the &#8216;Minute Men&#8217; of New England
and the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, the most important of all these
being the battle of Bunker Hill, which took place
on the seventeenth day of June of last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our soldiers defeated the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> there,
didn't they, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they got all the better of the battle, but
their ammunition gave out and they had to retreat.  Still, it was equivalent to a victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's what I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and then <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>–who
was appointed commander-in-chief of the army
by the Second Continental Congress, at Philadelphia in May of last year, and who went to
<span class="name.city">Boston</span> and took charge of the army on July
third–kept the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> penned up in <span class="name.city">Boston</span> till
about the middle of last March, when he fortified <span class="name.city">Dorchester Heights</span>, overlooking <span class="name.city">Boston</span>,
the work being performed in one night, and
next morning the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, seeing what had been
done and realizing that they would be at the
mercy of the patriot army if they remained in
<span class="name.city">Boston</span>, hurriedly boarded the ships of the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> fleet, then in the harbor, and sailed to
Halifax, Nova Scotia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> and his patriot
troops went down and took possession of
<span class="name.city">Boston</span>!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  But <span class="name.char">General Howe</span>, the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
commander-in-chief, did not keep his troops
long in Halifax, but sailed to New York, where
he was soon joined by the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> fleet under
his brother, <span class="name.char">Admiral Howe</span>, and by <span class="name.char">General
Clinton</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> and his patriot
army came to New York and took possession of
that city,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he's there now, and that is where
we are going, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>!  Say, I'm glad of it.  I want
to join the army, and fight the redcoats.  I want
to fight for liberty and independence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I.  And we will, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When will we go, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a few days, likely.  We have to get things
in shape so that mother and sister Mary can get
along without us, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but that won't take long.  Most of the
work for the summer is done, and all there will
be to do on the farm is to wait for the crops to
ripen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True.  Well, we'll go in a few days, now,
likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't be in too big a hurry to go, sons,&#8221;
said <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span> sadly, when they were discussing the matter, that evening at supper.  &#8220;Think
how lonesome Mary and I will be when you are
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Mrs. Foster</span> and the girls will come over
often,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;They will keep you cheered
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will help,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;But we will
be lonely, just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might try to be cheerful, mother,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;<span class="name.char">Dick</span> and I won't want to think of you
as being lonely.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I will get along all right, sons,&#8221; said the
brave woman, forcing a smile.  She wanted to
have the boys go away feeling that she was in
good spirits.</p>

<p>They had just finished eating supper, when
<span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span> came in.  There was an eager,
excited look on his face, and he said earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a plot on foot against <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,
and I came right over to let you know about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A plot!&#8221; exclaimed <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>, her face
paling and her voice trembling.  &#8220;By whom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Tories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; breathed the woman, a look of anxiety
on her face.  &#8220;This is terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't worry, mother,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;We
know of it, now, and can prepare for them.  It
will not be as if we were to be taken by surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don't be afraid, <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.
&#8220;We'll make the Tories wish they had attended
to their own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you learn about it, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>?&#8221; asked
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father found it out this afternoon.  You
know, he's a king's man, and they weren't as
careful as they might have been, and he heard
them talking about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are their plans?&#8221; asked <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are going to come here to-night at
about midnight and break in, take you and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>
out and tie you to trees and whip you–at least,
that is their intention.  They won't succeed,
though, you may be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed they will not!&#8221; smiled <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;There
will be some sadder and wiser Tories before the
night is ended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sore afraid, son!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>.
&#8220;There will be a dozen or more of the Tories,
and what can you and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> do against so
many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll come over and help <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, <span class="name.char">Mrs.
Dare</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.  &#8220;As soon as father told me
about the plan, I made up my mind that I would
come here to-night and help fight the
Tories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you are all right, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, slapping his friend on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good of you, old fellow,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, seizing <span class="name.char">Ben's</span> hand and shaking it
heartily.  &#8220;We thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; said Mary, who saw that <span class="name.char">Ben's</span>
eyes were on her, as if he wished to hear what
she thought about it.  &#8220;It is indeed good of you,
<span class="name.char">Ben</span>, to volunteer to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that's all right,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, a pleased
look in his eyes.  &#8220;I tell you we will make it
lively for those Tories when they come sneaking
around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We'll do our best to give them a warm reception, at any rate,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll be over in an hour or so,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, &#8220;and
I'll bring a musket and a pistol along.  But how
about <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span> and Mary?  Hadn't they better
come over to our house until after the attack
has been made?  The folks told me to ask you to
come, <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span> and Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would be best,&#8221; agreed <span class="name.char">Mrs.
Dare</span>.  &#8220;But still, I hate to go away and leave
you boys here.  You might be reckless, when
if I were to stay you would be more careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't think that, mother,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;We
are going to go to war soon, and you can't be
with us then, and if you and Mary stayed
here, you might get hit with a stray bullet.
There is no use of your taking the risk.  We'll
be as careful with you away as if you were
here; and we will be in a position to fight
with more freedom and effect if you are not
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  If that is the case,
we will go over to <span class="name.char">Mr. Foster's</span>.   But we will return after the attack has been made, for we
wouldn't want any of the neighbors to see us
coming away from there in the morning, as that
would cause them to suspect that <span class="name.char">Mr. Foster</span>
had warned us, and might cause him trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, mother.  That will be all right.  You
and Mary can come home after we have driven
the Tories away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We'll go over to <span class="name.char">Mr. Foster's</span> as soon as it is
dark,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>.</p>

<p>Shortly after dark, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, accompanied by his
mother and Mary, went over to the Foster
home, and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> returned with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you're here, eh?&#8221; greeted <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;That's
fine.  I guess when those cowardly Tories put in
an appearance, they will get something that
they are not looking for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's what they will,&#8221; nodded <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.  &#8220;At
any rate, I hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish <span class="name.char">Zeke</span> and <span class="name.char">Lem</span> would be in the party,&#8221;
said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, grinning.  &#8220;I'd like to give them another thrashing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you thrash them, before?&#8221; queried
<span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;In <span class="name.city">Philadelphia</span>, yesterday.  Didn't <span class="name.char">Dick</span> tell
you about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you tell me now,&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>Then <span class="name.char">Tom</span> did so, detailing the encounter on
the streets of <span class="name.city">Philadelphia</span>, and when he had
heard all, <span class="name.char">Ben</span> said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!  I'm glad you thrashed them.&#8221;</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 1.2em;">A Night Attack</h2>



<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">T</span>hey're</span> coming, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>!&#8221; whispered <span class="name.char">Ben
Foster</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I hear footsteps,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;But,&#8221;
after listening a few moments, &#8220;there is only
one person coming.  Perhaps it isn't the Tories
after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that's their game–to make you think
there is only one.  He walks boldly, so you can
hear him, while the others creep up.  It is the
Tory gang, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely you are right.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now nearly midnight, and so it was
time for the Tories to put in their appearance,
if they were to make the attack that night, as
<span class="name.char">Mr. Foster</span> had heard them say they would do.</p>

<p>Closer sounded the footsteps, and then they
ceased and there came a knock on the door.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> did not answer, as he did not want the
fellow to suspect that the inmates of the house
were awake and on the alert.  The youths, gripping tightly their rifles and muskets, waited.
Their hearts were beating more rapidly than
was their wont, but it is safe to say that no
feeling of fear had place in their hearts.  Only
expectation, and eagerness to get at the Tories
dominated them.</p>

<p>After a brief period, the knock on the door
was repeated.  Then <span class="name.char">Dick</span> spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; he called out.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend,&#8221; was the reply, in a hoarse,
evidently disguised voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn't matter.  I have news, important news for you, <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no news for me that I don't know
already,&#8221; retorted the youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;  There was a quick suspicion in the voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that I know you are a Tory, and that
you have a number of companions, and intend
to try to get hold of my brother and myself and
tie us up and whip us.  I don't feel like permitting that, so you had better go away, if you
value your skins, for if you try to bother us, we
will surely defend ourselves and do harm to
you–if we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently the man realized it was useless to
carry the deception further, for he cried out,
sneeringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, will you indeed, <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>?  Well, let
me tell you something, my bold young rebel:
When we get through with you, you will not be
in a position to harm anybody.  We are going
to take you out and whip you soundly, as should
be done with all such traitors to the king as
you two are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you fair warning,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
sternly; &#8220;if you attempt to injure myself and
brother, you will get badly hurt.  Go about
you business and leave us alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we'll go about our business and leave
you alone, of course we will–but it will be after
we have tied you up to one of the trees here in
your own yard!  Open the door, or we'll break
it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wasting breath,&#8221; in a voice of contempt.  &#8220;We would be very foolish if we opened
the door, would we not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn't matter; we'll break the door down
in a jiffy, anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you do, you'll be very sorry.  Remember,
I gave you fair warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!  Boys' threats don't scare us worth a
cent.  We'll have the door down and you two
rebel brats out of there very quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we'll have some of you Tory hounds
lying dead on the grass of our own yard very
soon, too.  Mind what I tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>A sneering laugh was the only reply.  They
had no idea the boys would really shoot at them.</p>

<p>There was the sound of receding footsteps,
followed by the murmur of voices, and then a
few minutes later there sounded the trampling
of many feet, and crash! something struck the
door, causing it to creak and groan under the
impact.</p>

<p>&#8220;They've found a log, and will better the door
down,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;Be ready, boys and as
soon as the door falls, fire through the opening.
They have brought this upon themselves, and if
we injure a few of them, it will be their own
fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We're ready, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we'll fire when you give the word,&#8221;
from <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, boys.  Level your weapons, and be
ready, and when I say &#8216;Fire&#8217;, pull trigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, we will!&#8221; came the reply.</p>

<p>The next moment there sounded the trampling of feet once more, and crash! the end of the
log struck the door.  This time the impact was
so great the door could not withstand it, and
down it came with a thud.  At least a dozen
forms could be seen through the opening, outlined against the horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; cried <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, his voice ringing out
loudly and clearly.</p>

<p>The youths obeyed the command, pulling trigger instantly, and the crash that followed was
deafening, and seemed almost sufficient in volume to raise the roof.</p>

<p>It was an effective volley, too, for two or
three of the Tories were hit by bullets, as was
evidenced by the yells and screams of pain and
rage that they gave utterance to.  They fell
back, in dismay, the log dropping to the ground
with a thud.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span>, instinctively realizing that the Tories
were stricken with a feeling of dismay, not to
say terror, because of their reception, cried,
&#8220;Charge them, boys!  At them!  Give it to the
scoundrels!&#8221;</p>



<p>With a yell that must have added to the
dismay of the enemy, the youths dashed out
through the doorway and attacked the Tories,
laying about them with the butts of their rifles
and muskets, and discharging their pistols.</p>

<p>Thud, thud, thud!  Thus sounded the impact
of the butts of the weapons with the heads,
arms and bodies of the ruffians, and with each
thud sounded a yell of pain and rage from the
recipient of the blow.  Then, suddenly the
Tories took refuge in flight, running from the
scene as swiftly as possible, and fairly falling
over the fence in their haste to get away.  They
were quickly out of sight, and the affair was at
an end.  The three youths had put their enemies to rout, and without having sustained any
injury whatever.</p>

<p>They were well pleased, and although they
had not killed any of the Tories outright, yet the
youths were sure they had wounded several, for
they had heard the ruffians give utterance to
cries of pain, and too, they saw blood on the
ground in several places.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> now hastened to the Foster home
and reported the victory over the Tories, and
was congratulated by all there, even <span class="name.char">Mr. Foster</span>,
the avowed king's man, seeming very well
pleased for he was an honest, honorable man,
and not at all in sympathy with the night-marauding tactics of his Tory neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span> and Mary accompanied <span class="name.char">Dick</span> home,
and the good woman thanked <span class="name.char">Ben</span> for coming
and helping her sons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that's all right,&#8221; smiled <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.  &#8220;I was
glad to come.  I wanted a chance at those
cowardly Tories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we thrashed them soundly, too,
mother,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think there is any danger that they
will return?&#8221; queried <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>, somewhat
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think so, mother,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.
&#8220;They've had all the fighting they want, for one
night, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>.  &#8220;But I'll
stay here, <span class="name.char">Mrs. Dare</span>, and if they come, we will
be able to drive them away again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Tories did not return.  They had, as
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> said, evidently seen all the fighting they
wanted, for one night.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span>, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, and <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span> began getting
ready to go to New York, that day, to join the
patriot army under <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>.  They
would be ready in a day or two, as there was
not a great deal to do.</p>

<p>Next day, however, <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span> had news for
his friends.  He came over, an eager look in his
eyes, and told the brothers that <span class="name.char">Zeke Boggs</span> had
just told him that he and <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span> were going
over to <span class="name.place">Long Island</span> and join the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
army.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says that they don't intend to let us get
ahead of them, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; finished <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.  &#8220;They
hope to fight against us in some of the battles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess they will get the chance,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they'll get the worst of the fighting,
too,&#8221; declared <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;That they will!&#8221; coincided <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two things that I hope to do,
when in the patriot army,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;One
is, to find where my father is imprisoned
and free him, and the other to meet <span class="name.char">Zeke
Boggs</span> and <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span> in battle and defeat
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, his eyes shining.
&#8220;We must find father as soon as possible, and
rescue him from the hands of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.  I
think we can do so, don't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I surely think so, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you'll be certain to find out where he is,
and before very long, then you can rescue him,&#8221;
proposed <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after that we can thrash <span class="name.char">Zeke</span> and <span class="name.char">Lem</span>
with a good heart,&#8221; suggested <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think <span class="name.char">Zeke</span> and <span class="name.char">Lem</span> will make very
good soldiers,&#8221; remarked <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they'll run, the very first time they
get into a battle,&#8221; concluded <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

now that the people of the Colonies had declared
for Independence, sat at his desk, looking over
some papers.  He now glanced up at the orderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the young man, orderly?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says his name is Richard Dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never heard of him,&#8221; with a shake
of the head.  &#8220;Did he state his business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, your excellency.  I asked him, but he
said he preferred seeing you and stating his
business direct.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Washington</span> was thoughtful for a few moments, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a young man, you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your excellency; or rather, I should
perhaps have said youth.  I doubt if he is more
than eighteen or nineteen years of age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H'm,&#8221; murmured the commander-in-chief;
&#8220;I am pretty busy, but will see him briefly.
Show him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your excellency,&#8221; and the orderly withdrew.</p>

<p>He was back again in a few moments, however, and ushered in a handsome, manly-looking
youth, at the same time announcing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Richard Dare, your excellency.&#8221;  Then he
withdrew, leaving the two alone.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Washington</span> glanced up as his visitor
was announced, and when his eyes took in the
handsome face, the fine physique and perfect
poise of the youth, he gave a slight start and
eyed him keenly and somewhat searchingly,
with considerable interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Richard Dare?&#8221; the commander-in-chief remarked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, your excellency,&#8221; saluting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, <span class="name.char">Mr. Dare</span>.  Now if you will be so
kind as to state your business as briefly as possible, I will hear you.  I am quite busy, as you
may well suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me for taking up your time, sir,&#8221;
said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, &#8220;but I wished to see you in person,
as I have come to make you an offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed?  What kind of an offer, my
young friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you, sir:  I and two friends of
about my own age have come to New York
from our homes in the western part of New
Jersey.  We arrived here only this morning,
and I, as their spokesman, have come to offer
our services to you, sir.  We are ardent patriots
and desirous of fighting in our country, for
the freedom and independence of our people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Washington</span>, looking at
the youth with renewed interest.  &#8220;Bravely
spoken!  Your desire is a commendable one,
and certainly I shall be glad to accept of your
offer, if your parents are willing that you shall
enter the army.  You are mere youths, as it
were, and I would not want to take advantage
of your offer unless it were satisfactory to
your parents.  They have knowledge of you
project?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, your excellency.  We have done
this with the knowledge and approval of our
parents.  My father, however, was captured in
his own dooryard, less than two weeks ago, by a
gang of Tories, and I and my brother <span class="name.char">Tom</span> decided to join your army, to take father's place,
as he had intended to join, and also with the
hope of finding and rescuing him.  One of our
friends, when he heard that we were going to
do this, came and told us that he wanted to
come, too, and here we are.  I hope you will
accept us, sir, and give us a place in your
army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be pleased to do so, <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>,&#8221; was
the hearty reply.  &#8220;From this moment you are
a member of the Continental Army, as are your
companions also.  I thank you, Dare, for your
interest in the welfare of our country, and pray
extend to your companions my thanks, and tell
them that I shall expect to hear a good report
from them when it comes to actual conflict with
the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they will give a good account of
themselves, your excellency,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, quietly
but modestly.  &#8220;I am sure they will fight hard
for freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt about it, my boy.  Well, the
matter is settled, then.  Here, take this order
and present it to <span class="name.char">Colonel Morgan</span>, who will
find room for you in his regiment, now in process of formation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief hastily wrote the
order and handed it to <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, who took it and
saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, your excellency,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I will
do as you have commanded.  My companions will
be delighted when I make my report to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, saluting again, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> left the presence
of the great man, and was quickly back with
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, who were quartered in a building
only about a block distant.</p>

<p>They greeted him eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221;
cried <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, I saw him,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he say?&#8221; queried <span class="name.char">Ben
Foster</span>.  &#8220;Did he accept our offer of our
services?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;He seemed to be
pleased, and said that he hopes to hear a good
report concerning us when we come in actual
conflict with the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he will be satisfied on that score,&#8221;
said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, a grim look on his face.  &#8220;I think we
will be as good fighters as any of them, when
we get started, eh, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>,&#8221; nodded <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, his eager
eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get ready and come with me, boys,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, beginning to gather up his belongings,
which were not many, as the youths had not
brought very much luggage with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221; queried <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are to report to <span class="name.char">Colonel Morgan</span>, and
will be assigned to his regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.  &#8220;Then we will be genuine
soldiers, eh, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that will be fine!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;I'm
ready.  Lead the way to <span class="name.char">Colonel Morgan's</span>
quarters, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later the youths set out.  They
found <span class="name.char">Colonel Morgan</span> and <span class="name.char">Dick</span> gave him the
note from the commander-in-chief, whereupon
they were assigned to their new quarters, their
names having been enrolled on the membership
list of the regiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we are soldiers, sure enough!&#8221; murmured <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>, his eyes shining.  &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, patriot soldiers, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, quietly.  There was an air of satisfaction on his face
also.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will be ready to take part in the first
battle that takes place,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.  &#8220;Say, that'll
be fine.  I am eager to be in a battle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;I want to fight for
Independence and the freedom of the <span class="name.nationality">American</span>
people.  And, too, I want to fight and rescue our
father, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  We won't forget that part
of our work!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 1.2em;">Chosen for Dangerous Work</h2>



<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">D</span>ick</span>, <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> made friends rapidly,
and were soon well acquainted with the
majority of the members of the company to
which they had been assigned, and with many
of the members of other companies that were
quartered in the same building and near at
hand.</p>

<p>They had been in New York about a week,
and were feeling quite at home.  One afternoon,
as they were sitting in the big front room, talking to some of the soldiers, the door opened and
an orderly from headquarters was seen standing on the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anyone here by the name of Dare?&#8221;
he asked.  &#8220;<span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>, I believe it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am he,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, advancing.  &#8220;What is
wanted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wanted at headquarters.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, at once.  The commander-in-chief
orders you to report.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go right along with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.  Such were his instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> put on his hat and took his departure in
the orderly's company, after telling <span class="name.char">Ben</span> and
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> that he would probably be back soon.</p>

<p>They arrived quickly at headquarters, and
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> was ushered into the private room occupied by the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> saluted and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You sent for me, your excellency?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Dare.  Be seated,&#8221; and he pointed to a
chair near his desk.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> took the seat and then looked at the
commander-in-chief inquiringly.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Washington</span> did not say anything for
a few moments, but eyed <span class="name.char">Dick</span> keenly and
searchingly.  It was evident that he was appraising the boy's value carefully, and it seemed
that the result was satisfactory, for he gave a
sigh as of relief, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you, Dare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen.  That is young.  You are a mere
youth, but somehow I believe you are the one
to do what I wish done.  I have a mind to try
you, anyway.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; pausing and looking impressively at the youth, &#8220;if I were to ask you to
undertake something that was exceedingly
dangerous, something that might easily result
in your death if you made a false step, what
would you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would say, your excellency, that if you
had confidence enough in me to think I
might succeed, I would be only too glad to try.
You have only to command and I will obey,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like a true Son of Liberty!&#8221; exclaimed the commander-in-chief.  &#8220;That is
what I expected to hear you say, however.  I
believe you are a brave, sensible youth, and that
it is possible you may succeed in the undertaking which I have in mind, even though
several grown men have already failed.  You
had better think well before you consent to attempt this task, however, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  It is one
fraught with such danger that I would not
think of ordering you to attempt it, considering
your age.  But if, on the other hand, after
knowing what the work is, you still wish to go
ahead, I shall be delighted to avail myself of
your services.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be glad to attempt the work, sir.
Pray state the case.  What is the nature of the
work you wish me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is spy-work!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick's</span> heart leapt with joy.  Spy-work!
This, of all things was what he felt that he
would most like to do.  As a spy he would have
to venture into the enemy's territory, would
have to even penetrate to their midst and secure
information as to their plans and, too, he might
thus find and rescue his father.  It was fine to
think of, and the sparkle in his eyes must have
told the commander-in-chief that the youth was
pleased, for he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be favorably impressed, rather
than otherwise, my boy.  You think you will
like spy-work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your excellency,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;I
think I shall like it, better than anything else.
I shall be glad to attempt any work in that line
that you wish.  Just tell me where you wish me
to go and what you want me to do, and I will do
my best to make a success of the work, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  I will do so.  You know,
perhaps, that the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> army is located on the
southwest shore of <span class="name.place">Long Island</span>, near York Bay,
and the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> fleet lies just outside the Narrows and off York Bay.  The <span class="name.nationality">British</span> outnumber us considerably, I think, but just how
much I do not know.  And this is one thing that
I wish to learn.  I want to learn the numerical
strength of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, and also I wish to find
out, if such a thing is possible, the intentions
of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> commander-in-chief.  This is a
big undertaking, my boy, and as I have told
you, several of my best men have already tried
to accomplish this and failed, so you can see the
magnitude of the task that confronts you.  It
will be no disgrace if you should fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may fail, sir,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, modestly; &#8220;I may
not succeed in securing the information you
desire, but I will make the attempt, and I will
say this, that if such a thing as securing the
information is possible, I will do it.  I will do
my very best, sir, you may rest assured of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  I feel confident that if you fail
it will be only after you have made every effort
to succeed.  Well, it is settled, then?  You will
attempt his spy-work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your excellency.  When shall I start?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This evening.  I will give you a letter of introduction to <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>, who is in command of teh patriot force on <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>,
and he will give you all the information and
assistance in his power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.  At what hour shall I report
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be here at six, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  I will have the letter
for you, and then you will go down to the East
River in company with one of my orderlies,
and a boatman will take you across to the Long
Island side.  It is not far from there to the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span>, where you will locate <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will report here at six, your excellency,&#8221;
said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and then saluting, he took his departure.</p>

<p>When he returned to his quarters and told
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> that <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> had
selected him to go over onto <span class="name.place">Long Island</span> and
do some spying, the youths were surprised, but
were delighted as well, for they
felt that it was an honor to <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>



<p>&#8220;That will be fine,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>.  &#8220;I believe you will make a good spy, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could go with you,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, looking wistfully at his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be best that I go alone, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;One can do spy-work better than two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I vould lige dot sby vork,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Fritz
Schmockenburg</span>, a fat, <span class="name.nationality">Dutch</span> soldier, gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a foine spoy yez would be afther makin',
<span class="name.char">Fritz</span>,&#8221; chuckled <span class="name.char">Tim Murphy</span>, a merry Irish
patriot.  &#8220;Yez would be caught the first thing,
and the only thing thot would kape thim from
hangin' yez would be because they wouldn't
have inny rope sthout enough to hould your
weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221; queried <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;This evening at six.&#8221;</p>

<p>The youths discussed the matter at considerable length, and were glad that <span class="name.char">Dick</span> had been
selected for such important work, though they
were somewhat fearful for his safety.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and
<span class="name.char">Ben</span> cautioned him to be careful, and he was the
recipient of advice from others, all well-meant,
but of course not likely to be of much use to
him, as he would have to govern his actions
mainly by existing circumstances, after he was
on the ground and at work.</p>

<p>Shortly before six he bade <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, and
his comrades good-bye and made his way to
headquarters, where he was given the letter of
introduction by the commander-in-chief, and
also a few kindly words of encouragement.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> will give you all the information and help in his power,&#8221; <span class="name.char">General
Washington</span> said.  &#8220;Go, now, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, my boy, and
may you be successful is my prayer.  Good-bye,
and heaven bless you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> hand, and then with a good-bye and a salute, the youth took his departure.</p>

<p>An orderly accompanied him to the dock and
summoned a boatman, and then <span class="name.char">Dick</span> got in and
was ferried across the East River.  Alighting
on the <span class="name.place">Long Island</span> shore, he set out in the
direction of <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>, reaching there
shortly after dark.</p>

that he was a friend, was told to advance
and give the countersign.</p>

<p>He approached the sentinel, and when near
him, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a patriot, but do not know the countersign.  I wish to see <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you and why do you wish to see the
general?&#8221; the sentinel asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Dare, and I am a messenger
from <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>.  I have a letter of
introduction to <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.  I'll summon the officer of the
guard and he'll conduct you to the general.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did so, and the officer asked <span class="name.char">Dick</span> a few
questions, seemed satisfied, and conducted him
to the quarters occupied by <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> saluted on entering the presence of the
general, and drawing the letter from his pocket,
handed it to <span class="name.char">Putnam</span>, who took it an read the
contents, after which he gave <span class="name.char">Dick</span> a keen,
searching and somewhat wondering glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Richard Dare?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;H'm.  The commander-in-chief says here
that you are going down to the enemy's territory to try to do some spying.  You are rather
young, it seems to me, to be going such work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time will cure that,&#8221; smiled <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes–if you live,&#8221; grimly.  &#8220;This is very
dangerous business you are entering upon, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> said, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?  Well, it is a fact, and I have my
doubts regarding your ability to do anything,
but since the commander-in-chief has seen fit to
try you and has sent you to me for the purpose
of having me give you what information I possess regarding the location of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, I
will do what I can to assist you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general then gave <span class="name.char">Dick</span> all the information that he thought would be of value to
him, and the youth listened attentively.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Putnam</span> when he had finished,
&#8220;do you think you can find the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> without
any trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I can find the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, sir,&#8221; was the
reply; &#8220;but I don't know about the trouble part.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim general chuckled.  He seemed to
like the dry humor of the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you'll do, Dare,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I'm beginning to think the commander-in-chief
showed good judgment in sending you, after all.
But, I might have known that such was the case,
for he is a man who seldom makes mistakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he hasn't made a mistake in this
instance, sir,&#8221; modestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he hasn't.  It is possible that a boy
like you may be better able to penetrate to the
enemy's lines and secure information than a
man, for the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> will not be so likely to
suspect you of being a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> said, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The position is well taken, I feel confident.
Well, Dare, be careful, take care of yourself
and secure all the information possible regarding the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do my best, General.  Well, I must be
going.&#8221;</p>



<p>The general shook hands with <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and
wished him good luck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't let the redcoats get you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won't get me, if I can help it,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Good-bye, <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> did not start just then, however, for the
very good reason that while he had been engaged in conversation with <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>, a
storm that had been threatening  that afternoon
and evening, broke upon them, the wind blew a
gale and the rain poured down in torrents, the
lightning was incessant and the roar of the
thunder terrific.  It was indeed a severe storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not think of starting out to-night,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>. &#8220;You could not
find your way anywhere, and would simply get
soaked to the skin, or perhaps struck by lightning.  I will give you a bed, and you will remain here till morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless that will be best,&#8221; agreed <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
though he disliked the delay.  Still, he felt that
it would do no good to go in such a storm, for as
the general had said, he could not find his way
to the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment, or accomplish anything if he did find it.</p>



<p>So he remained on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span> that night,
only to find it still raining the next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not want to start out in the daytime, anyhow,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>; &#8220;so it
does not matter.  You will stay till evening,
and then if it has ceased raining, you can start
on your expedition.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was still raining hard, when evening came,
however, and <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> said it would be
foolish to make the start in the storm.  So <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
remained all that night, and all next day.  The
rain had ceased soon after sunrise and the sun
shone brightly that day, drying the ground
pretty thoroughly, by evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make the start, this evening, Dare,&#8221;
said the general.  &#8220;I don't suppose the delay in
getting away from here will make any difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not, sir,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>After dark that evening, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> took his departure, and as soon as he was past the sentinels, he struck out southward.  The <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
army was at that time encamped near the
Flatlands, about two miles from the bay and
about two miles south of Flatbush.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> walked onward at a moderate pace.
There was no hurry, and besides, by hurrying
he might run right into a party of redcoats, and
this would be bad, as it would likely result in
his capture.</p>

<p>It were better to make haste slowly.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
realized this, and he decided to take his time
and exercise his every care.  Caution was a necessary adjunct of a spy.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> was eager to succeed.  Several men had
failed, and had doubtless been captured, and if
he could accomplish his object it would be a big
feather in his cap.  He was intensely patriotic,
anyway, and this made him extremely desirous
of succeeding in securing the information regarding the plans of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.</p>

<p>He reached the wooded heights about halfway
between the village of Bedford and Flatbush
after a walk of an hour or so, and having
climbed the hill, he paused on the summit and
listened intently for some time.  It was his
thought that perhaps a party of <span class="name.nationality">British</span> might
be located here, and he did not want to run into
their midst, if such were the case.</p>

<p>He heard sounds, but only such as are usually to be heard in the woods at night–the chirping of crickets, the buzzing of the wings of
insects, and the call of nightbirds.  He heard
nothing that would indicate the presence of
human beings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess there are no redcoats in these
woods,&#8221; he murmured after listening a while.
&#8220;The <span class="name.nationality">British</span> haven't advanced this far yet,
likely.  I'll go ahead, but will be exceedingly
careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved forward slowly, and cautiously
made his way down the south slope of the
wooded hill.  He paused every few moments and
listened.  He was not going to take any chances
of discovery and capture, if he could avoid it by
exercising care.</p>

<p>Somehow <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> heart thrilled with pleasure,
even though he were on a perilous undertaking.
He was working for <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>, trying to do something that would be of benefit to
the great Cause of Liberty, and this made him
experience a feeling of happiness.  The danger
did not have any effect on him, save to, if
anything, add to the zest.  He was a brave
youth, though not a foolhardy one, and the
danger made the work all the more interesting
and exhilarating.</p>

<p>On he went down the slope, slowly and
cautiously.  He had to practically feel his way,
for in under the trees it was very dark and he
could not see to pick a path.  This made it slow
work, but he had all night for his task, if he
wished so much time, and so he did not
worry because he could not proceed at a swift
pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Slow but sure,&#8217; is a good motto,&#8221; he told
himself.  &#8220;There will be times, doubtless, when
it will pay me to move swiftly, but this is not
one of the times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly <span class="name.char">Dick</span> paused and stood stock still, his
every nerve tense, his every sense on the alert.
He thought that he had heard the sound of voices!</p>

<p>He listened intently, and presently his heart
gave a leap.  Yes, he had not been mistaken.
Over to the right, and not very far distant, he
had heard someone talking.  At least two men were
there, engaged in conversation, their voices being pitched low.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> strained his eyes, but could not catch
sight of the speakers.  He could only judge of
their location and distance from him by the
sound of their voices, and he judged that they
were perhaps a dozen yards from him.  This
was rather close, if they were <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers,
as he had no doubt they were, and he decided
that the best thing for him to do was to get
away from their vicinity as quickly as possible.
It would be well to be silent about it, too, for if
they should discover his presence, they would
doubtless make a great outcry and try to capture him.</p>

<p>He began edging away, toward the left.
Every once in awhile he paused to listen.  The
voices could still be heard, but not so plainly
as at first.  He was gradually getting farther
and farther away from the speakers, and would
have been successful in escaping from the vicinity without his presence having been discovered,
but for an accident.  He struck his foot against
a good-sized stone, which was lying right on the
edge of a rather steep slope, and the rock, becoming dislodged, went tumbling and plunging
downward through the underbrush, making
what seemed to be a great noise, coming as it
did in the midst of the night stillness.  It
sounded as loud as thunder in <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I've done it!&#8221; he murmured, in some
dismay.  &#8220;That will rouse them sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was right, for instantly there came the
challenge, loud and clear:</p>



<p>&#8220;Halt!  Who comes there?&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be no doubt regarding the matter,
now; the men <span class="name.char">Dick</span> had heard talking were
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers doing picket duty.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick's</span> first impulse was to take to his heels
and run at the top of his speed, but his second
thought was that perhaps if he were to stand
perfectly still, the redcoats would come to the
conclusion that there was no one in the vicinity
save themselves, and would go ahead with their
conversation after a few minutes of listening.
But it did not work out that way.  After a few
moments of silence there came the command, in
a stern voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?  Answer, or I will fire!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> did not like the idea of being fired at,
even in the darkness.  He knew the soldier could
not see to take aim, but a chance shot might be
as successful as one that was aimed.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> did
not care to take the chance, anyway, and he
quickly, but very cautiously shifted his position and got a tree between himself and the
redcoats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, he won't be able to hit me, even if he
does fire,&#8221; thought the youth with a feeling of
relief.  &#8220;Now if he will just make up his mind
that there is no one here and resume the conversation with his comrade, I shall be able to slip
away and escape, doubtless.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the redcoats were evidently not satisfied
to let the matter go thus.  &#8220;Let's investigate,
comrade,&#8221; <span class="name.char">Dick</span> heard a voice say.  And then
he heard another in reply:  &#8220;All right.  If there
is anybody round here, we will either run him
down or frighten him out of his boots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's what we will, comrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I feel confident there is somebody near
here.  What else would make the noise that we
heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know, comrade.  I think it likely that
somebody is about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am positive, sure of it as can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, come on, then.  Let's search all around.
We ought to be able to lay him by the heels, for
we can hear him if he tries to run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True.  Come, comrade.  We'll quickly have
the fellow, if he's here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then <span class="name.char">Dick</span> heard the trampling of feet, which
sounded closer and closer, and he realized that
he must get away from there at once, or the
redcoats would be upon him.</p>

<p>Having so decided, he lost not time, but
moved away as cautiously as possible.  He
went a bit faster than he should have done, to
maintain a noiseless movement, however, for he
stepped on a fallen branch, which broke with a
cracking sound, and the very next step he
stumbled over a log, and fell into a brushpile,
making considerable noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;A spy!&#8221; he heard one of the redcoats cry.
&#8220;There's somebody there, sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; cried the other soldier, loudly.
&#8220;Stop, or I'll fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>But <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, fearing to remain, as he would almost certainly be found and captured, leaped to
his feet and took to his heels, running as fast as
he dared; to run too fast, would have been to
break his head against a tree, more than likely.</p>

<p>The <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers heard him, evidently, for
one cried, excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes!  I hear him running!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried the other, &#8220;but I'll put a stop to
his running, or know the reason why.  Here
goes to wing the rebel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next instant the loud crack of a musket
rang upon the still night air.  At the same instant <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span> fell sprawling upon his face on
the ground, and lay still.</p>

<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">O</span>n</span> the afternoon of the second day after
the departure of <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span> from patriot
headquarters in New York, <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span> appeared there, and to the orderly at the door
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to see <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you do, eh?&#8221; was the query.  The orderly
could not imagine what business this sixteen-year-old boy could have with the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.  Show me to his presence, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The orderly looked at the eager, bright face
of the boy with more of interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>!&#8221; in surprise.  &#8220;Why, there was
a young fellow here a couple of days ago whose
name was Dare–<span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>, I believe it was.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; quietly; &#8220;he is my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, your brother!  Are you a member of the
patriot army, also?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.  I'm in <span class="name.char">Colonel Morgan's</span> regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The orderly stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;the Dares seem to be
pretty well represented in the Continental
Army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.  Our father was captured by Tories,
and <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and I made up our minds that we
would join the patriot army and do all we could
to bring about the defeat of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> and
Tories, and if possible rescue our father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that is the right spirit, certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you show me to the presence of the
commander-in-chief, sir?&#8221; questioned <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,
eagerly.  &#8220;I am very desirous of seeing him,&#8221; he
added, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;I will speak
to the commander-in-chief, and if he is willing,
I will conduct you to his presence.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> accompanied the orderly along the hall,
pausing presently when told to do so.  The
orderly said he would be back in a few moments,
and disappeared in a room at one side.  He
quickly returned and said that <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> would see the youth.</p>

<p>The next moment he ushered <span class="name.char">Tom</span> into the
presence of the commander-in-chief, announcing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Master <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general looked up from some papers he
was examining, and gave <span class="name.char">Tom</span> a keen, searching
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Master <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your excellency,&#8221; saluting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother to <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good.  What can I do for you, my
boy?&#8221;  The great man's air and tone were
kindly, and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, encouraged, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to ask a favor, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the favor?  Be brief, as my time is
of value, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.  I have come to ask that you
let me go over onto <span class="name.place">Long Island</span>, the same as
you have done with <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Washington</span> looked at the boy in
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you want to do that?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be with <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, sir, or near him, all
the time, if possible.  I promised my mother
that I would stay at <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> side and fight side
by side with him, and if I stay here, when he
is over on <span class="name.place">Long Island</span>, I won't be keeping my
word, sir.  Something might happen to <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.
He might get into trouble with the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, and
if I was near at hand, I could render him assistance,
and if he were captured, I might be
able to rescue him.  I hope you will let me go,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief looked thoughtfully
at the boy.  There was a look of admiration in
his eyes, and to himself he said:  &#8220;A brave
pair of lads are those two Dares, I feel certain.&#8221;
Aloud he said, after a few moments:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know whether to grant your request
or not, my boy.  I have sent <span class="name.char">Dick</span> over to Long
Island on a spying expedition, and if you were
to go also and join him, it might hamper him in
his work.  At the same time, I dislike to refuse your request, since you made your mother
the promise that you would stay by your
brother's side. Still, you can hardly hope to be
always together.  War is cruel, and one can not
always do as one would like, or be where one
would wish to be.  We must all go where we
think we can be of the most benefit to the
Cause, and do that which will be most beneficial.  Do you think you could do <span class="name.char">Dick</span> any good,
if I were to let you go, my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it possible, sir.  He is going into
great danger, as I understand it, and I might
render him very valuable assistance.  At any
rate, if you will let me go, I will promise that
at least I will not in any way interfere with
his work or do anything to cause him to fail in
the task he has before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good.  Then I will grant your request.
Go, my boy; but be careful.  I will give you a
note to <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>, on <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>,
and he will tell you which way to go to find
your brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.  You are very kind, and I
will try to do nothing to cause you to regret
that you let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is right.&#8221;  The commander-in-chief
wrote a brief note, addressed it to <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> and handed it to <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;There.  Now go, my boy, and may you succeed in joining your brother and benefit to him in his work.  Good-bye,&#8221; and he gave
the boy's hand a friendly grasp.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good-bye, your excellency,&#8221; and saluting,
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> took his departure.</p>

<p>He hastened down to the East River dock and
got a boatman to take him across to the east
shore, after which he made his way as quickly
as possible to the patriot quarters on <span class="name.city">Brooklyn
Heights</span>.</p>

<p>When he presented himself before <span class="name.char">General
Putnam</span>, and handed over the note, the officer,
after a perusal of the few words written there,
looked at the boy in some surprise and with no
little interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another one,&#8221; he said, with something like a
grim smile.  &#8220;The Dares certainly seem to be in
evidence to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Dick</span> was here, then, sir?&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has he been gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, about an hour, I should judge.  He had to remain
here until this evening on account of
the storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please direct me how to go in order to overtake him, <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do so as nearly as possible, my boy.&#8221;
Then the general gave <span class="name.char">Tom</span> all the directions
possible, and the boy said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.  I will try to join my brother
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better keep your eyes open, Master
Dare,&#8221; cautioned <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.  &#8220;You are
going where redcoats are thicker than mosquitoes, and that is saying a good deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll look out for them, sir,&#8221; with a smile.
&#8220;Good-bye, and thank you, <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's all right.  You are welcome.  Good-bye and good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> took his departure, and as soon as he
was out of the patriot encampment, he hastened
away in the direction that he had been told
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> had undoubtedly gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps by hurrying I may be able to overtake <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; was his thought.</p>

<p>He walked swiftly, at times running, and
came to the wooded hills much quicker than
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> had done.  He climbed the hill quickly,
and was soon making his way down the other
side.  He had gone only a few steps when he
heard the report of the musket-shot, sounding
close at hand and almost in front of him.</p>

<p>Instantly <span class="name.char">Tom</span> was greatly excited.  The
thought came to him at once that a redcoat had
fired that shot and that it had been fired at
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and with wildly-beating heart he ran forward, at the same time drawing a pistol from
his belt.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> was excited, but not at all
frightened.  His only fear was that perhaps
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> had been wounded or killed by the bullet
from the musket, and he was eager to get a shot
at the person who had just done the shooting.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard voices, and paused, listening intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if I got the rebel?&#8221; he heard one
say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely you did,&#8221; replied another voice.  &#8220;I
don't hear the sound of running feet any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Served the rascal right if I put a bullet
through him,&#8221; said the first voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.  That is what ought to happen to all
rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> heard these words, and his heart sank,
and then a feeling of anger blazed up in his
heart.  What if <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was killed, as these soldiers surmised.  It was terrible to contemplate,
and acting on the spur of the moment, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>
leveled his pistol, pointing in the direction
from which the voices sounded, and pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>Crack! went the pistol, and a howl of pain,
rage and surprise commingled went up on the
night air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh—ow!—ouch!  I'm shot!&#8221; cried one
of the voices.  &#8220;There are other rebels at hand,
comrade!  Perhaps we're surrounded!&#8221;</p>

<p>This gave <span class="name.char">Tom</span> an idea, and he at once acted
upon it.  If he could make the redcoats think
there were a number of patriot soldiers around,
they might be put to flight, and then he could
look for <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and learn whether he were injured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys!&#8221; he yelled loudly.  &#8220;Charge
the scoundrelly redcoats!  Kill them!  At them,
I say!&#8221;  And then, drawing his other pistol, he
fired another shot.</p>

<p>He had no way of knowing whether this bullet hit either of the redcoats, but he had
evidence that it was effective in one way, for
he heard the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers going tearing
down the slope, through the underbrush at a
great rate.  They had undoubtedly been seized
with a panic and taken to their heels.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> waited till he could no longer hear any
sounds of the fleeing redcoats, and then he called
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Dick</span>!  Oh, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">A</span>lmost</span> at once came the reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Tom</span>!  Oh, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  I'll be right with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hastened in the direction from which
<span class="name.char">Dick's</span> voice sounded, and a few minutes later
was at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world brought you here, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>?&#8221;
queried <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;I was never so surprised in
my life as when I heard your voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll tell you why I come, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  After
you left your quarters in New York, I got to
thinking, and I remembered what I had told
mother–that I would go to war with you and
fight side by side with you, you know, and I
thought of how I had let you go away on a
dangerous spying expedition alone, and I decided to follow you.  I went and asked permission of <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> to come over here,
and he gave it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He was willing for you to come, then, was
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.  He held back a little at first, but when
I told him about having promised mother I
would stick by you, he then said I might come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it has been all right, so far.  You got
here just in time to frighten those redcoats
away, but I don't believe that two can do spy-work successfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don't need to both actually do the spy-work, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  You can do that, and I'll stay
back and wait and watch, and then if anything
should happen to you, I would perhaps be able
to render you some assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True.  Well, now that you are here, you may
as well stay with me.  We'll go on down in the
neighborhood of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment together, and then you can hunt at hiding-place
and I will go ahead and see what I can do in the
way of spying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  That will suit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were not hit by the bullet from the redcoat's musket, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221; somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  At the very moment he fired I
tripped over a vine and fell headlong to the
ground.  I was still lying there when I heard
you fire your pistol, and then I heard you yell,
&#8216;Come on, boys&#8217;, and recognized your voice; but
I was sorely puzzled.  I didn't know what to
think.  I almost thought I must have dreamed
it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hit one of the rascals, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; he chuckled.
&#8220;I'll warrant you he did not think it was a
dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely no,&#8221; with an answering chuckle.
&#8220;Well, let's move.&#8221;</p>

<p>They set out down the slope, moving at a
fair pace, pausing occasionally to listen.  All
was quiet, however.  The redcoat pickets had
evidently retreated to the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment.</p>

<p>When <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> emerged from the timber, at the foot of the slope, they were able to
go at a faster pace, and they set out in the direction in which they believed the enemy's camp to
be.  They walked onward about half an hour,
and then came upon a little clump of trees.
Feeling certain that they must be in the vicinity
of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment, they went in among
the trees and stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait here a few minutes, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.
&#8220;I'm going to climb a tree and see if I can see
the campfires of the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> climbed a tree on the south side of the
clump, and looked toward the south.  He was
rewarded by seeing the twinkling lights of
the <span title="camp-fires">campfires</span>, seemingly at no very great
distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the encampment, sure enough,&#8221; he
murmured.  &#8220;Well, now, the question is, How
am I to get into the camp and secure information regarding the plans of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a poser.  It certainly seemed like a
hopeless task, but <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span> was not a youth to
be easily discouraged.  He had come here to spy
on the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> and learn their plans, and he
would do so, if such a thing were possible.</p>

<p>He climbed down and told his brother that he
had seen the campfires of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;But, what are you going
to do next, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?  How are you going to get
into their encampment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I decided on my course, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,&#8221; he said, &#8220;before I started out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to enter the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment
boldly and tell them that I want to join the
army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness!  That will be dangerous, brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but one can't do spy-work without encountering danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that.  Do you think that you can
succeed, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm going to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they take  you into the army–a boy like
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">General Washington</span> did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> army may be different.  They may
think that they don't need help badly enough
for them to accept boys as recruits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, even if that is the case, I will succeed
in entering the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's so.  That part will be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to approach the encampment?  Now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I don't see any use of waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better stay right here or in this
vicinity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.  When do you think you will be
back?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don't know.  Possibly to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm to wait till you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I'll get hungry before to-morrow
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to a farmhouse in the morning and get
some food.  There must be farmhouses near.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's so.  I can do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I may as well be going.  Good-bye,
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>; and–be careful, brother!
If anything should happen to you, it would
break mother's heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll be careful, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  You had better keep
your eyes open, too, for the redcoats may come
prowling around here to-morrow, and you must
not let them capture you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll not let them get me, brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then <span class="name.char">Dick</span> took his departure.  He had some
time since decided upon his course, and as soon
as he was a short distance away from the clump
of trees, he set out at a brisk walk, and made no
effort at concealment.  He did not care, now,
if he were halted by a <span class="name.nationality">British</span> picket or sentinel.</p>

<p>He walked swiftly onward, and about twenty
minutes later was hailed:</p>



<p>&#8220;Halt!  Who comes there?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick's</span> heart leaped, and he felt that he was
soon to be submitted to an ordeal, but he did
not hesitate, and answered firmly and promptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Advance, friend, and give the countersign,&#8221;
was the command.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> advanced till within a few yards of the
sentinel, whose form he could make out, it being
outlined against the light background made by
the campfires.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; ordered the sentinel.  &#8220;Give the
countersign before you come any further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know the countersign,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
quietly.  &#8220;But I am a friend, and I wish to see
the commander in charge of this army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph.  What do you want to see him
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to offer my services to fight for the
king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you do, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a loyal king's man, then, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would I be anxious to join the king's army
if I were not?&#8221; questioned <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  He had decided that there could be no harm in deceiving
the enemy.  In spy-work it would be absolutely
necessary to use this means.  His conscience
did not reproach him in the least, for he felt
that he was making the pretense of being a
king's adherent in a good cause–that of
Liberty.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; the soldier asked.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> had decided that it would be best to give
a fictitious name, so he gave the first one that
came into his mind:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Harry Fuller</span>,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Harry Fuller</span>, eh?  Well, <span class="name.char">Harry Fuller</span>, since
you are a loyal king's man and wish to join his
army, I will see that you have the opportunity.
I'll summon the officer of the guard and he
will conduct you to the commander of the
force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn't the full army, then?&#8221; queried
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;One division of it,&#8221; was the curt reply.
&#8220;There's enough of it here for you to join, I
guess, if you really mean business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentinel summoned the officer of the
guard, explained matters to him, and then the
officer conducted <span class="name.char">Dick</span> into the encampment,
and to a tent near its center.  This was occupied
by <span class="name.char">General Percy</span>, and the officer of the guard
entered and exchanged a few words with the
general, who was writing at a little, portable
desk, by the light of a candle, and then he
emerged and said to <span class="name.char">Dick</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;The general will see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he ushered the youth into the tent, at
the same time announcing:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Harry Fuller</span>, <span class="name.char">General Percy</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <span class="name.nationality">British</span> general looked up, eyed <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
sharply for a few moments, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <span class="name.char">Harry Fuller</span>, so you wish to join the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> army and fight for the king, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> had met the searching gaze of the
officer unflinchingly, and now he answered
promptly and firmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; such is my wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph.  How old are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather young, but no matter.  You can hold
a musket and shoot as good as a man, without
doubt, so should make a good soldier.  I accept
your offer, and will assign you to Colonel Harker's regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he scribbled a brief note, handed it to
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> and said:  &#8220;Give that to the colonel.  He
will take care of you.&#8221;  Lifting his voice, he
called out:  &#8220;Orderly!&#8221;</p>

<p>An orderly entered at once, and saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conduct this young man to Colonel Harker.
That is all.  Good-night, young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and followed
the orderly from the tent and to the point
where Harker's regiment was stationed, and
to that officer he handed the note from the general.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, a new recruit,&#8221; said the colonel, when
he had read the note.  &#8220;Very well, <span class="name.char">Harry Fuller</span>,
you are a member of Company H.  That is it,
yonder.  Take your place there.&#8221;  He pointed to
the company in question, and <span class="name.char">Dick</span> saluted and
joined the company, taking a seat with the
soldiers of Company H, some of whom greeted
him with nods, and many looking at him
with a slight show of curiosity, but saying
nothing.  One or two said:  &#8220;How are you, comrade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm all right, I guess,&#8221; <span class="name.char">Dick</span> replied to these,
smiling.</p>

<p>The soldiers smoked and talked, and <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
sat quietly there and listened.  He had an eager
interest in all that was said, for he wished to
learn all he possibly could.  That indeed was
what he had come there for.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> felt that he had been fortunate in getting within the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> lines so easily.  And, too,
he was lucky to have been accepted as a soldier.
He naturally had feared that his youth would be
against him, and that he would be refused on
that account.  But such had not been the case,
his youth had not counted against him, and he
was now in the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> camp, playing the part
of a <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldier.</p>

<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">D</span>ick</span> Dare had accomplished what had
seemed to be the most difficult part of the
task that he had come here to accomplish, viz.:
Gotten within the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> lines, had become, in
fact, a member of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> army.</p>

<p>So far so good.  Now to secure information
that would be of value to <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>
and a benefit to the great Cause of Liberty.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's your name?&#8221; asked one of the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Harry Fuller</span>,&#8221; <span class="name.char">Dick</span> replied</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, about ten miles from here,&#8221; replied the youth</p>

<p>&#8220;Parents living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you have joined the king's army and
are going to help make it hot for the rebels, hey&#8221;
with a chuckle.  &#8220;Good for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, &#8220;I am eager to get a chance
to strike blows against the rebels.  How soon do
you think that will happen?  When are we likely
to get into a battle with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard telling, young man.  That's for the
generals to say.  What their plans may be is
more than I can say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard it rumored in our part of the
country that he <span class="name.nationality">British</span> will make an attack on
the rebels soon.  That's the reason I came here
to-night.  I thought maybe the attack might be
made to-morrow, and if I didn't get here to-night, I would not arrive in time for the fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might be ordered to move against the
rebels to-morrow, for all I know,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;And then again we might be left sitting here a
week or a month.  I haven't any idea when the
move will be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it will be soon,&#8221; declared <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, with a
view to keeping up the pretense of being imbued
with an intense desire to get at the rebels.</p>

<p>&#8220;You'll get a chance to do all the fighting you
care for, one of these days, young fellow,&#8221; said
another soldier.  &#8220;Don't worry on that score.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not worrying about it, sir,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you will fight when the time
comes?&#8221; half-sneered another, rather evil-featured fellow, leering at <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;I'd be willing to wager that you'll do more running than
fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might lose your money if you wagered
it that way,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, quietly, gazing steadily
at the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might, but I don't think I would,&#8221; with a
harsh laugh.  &#8220;I don't think much of the
bravery of the <span class="name.nationality">Americans</span>, whether rebels or
king's men.  They are not the kind that make
good soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think that you are,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, sonny!&#8221; fiercely.  &#8220;I've been tried
in the fire, do you hear?  I'm a veteran, and
have seen service in the fields of Europe, India
and Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be great at blowing your own
horn, at any rate,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, quietly.  And
several of the other soldiers sitting near snickered,
which seemed to anger the other very much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to insult me?&#8221; he cried, glancing
fiercely at <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; coolly.  &#8220;I was simply stating a
fact, that is all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you had better be careful, that's all I
have got to say!&#8221; snarled the redcoat, viciously.
&#8220;If you weren't a boy, I would give you a
thumping for what you have already said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't let my youth hinder you,&#8221; retorted
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;I will say this, that I think you will find
the people of <span class="name.state">America</span> as brave as those of your
country or any other, and I think, too, that they
will make as brave and effective soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's right, youngster, hold up for your
own people,&#8221; said one of the soldiers approvingly.  &#8220;The boy's all right, Coggins,&#8221; to the ill-natured soldier.  &#8220;You had no business talking
as you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; sneered Coggins.  &#8220;I meant what I
said, but as the young fellow is not yet out of
his teens, I'll pay no attention to his words.  It
wouldn't look well for me to thrash a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might find that you had your hands
full if you tried it,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, coldly.  He had
taken a dislike to the boastful redcoat, and as
he was a brave youth, and also had always
found himself a match for any man he had ever
engaged in a physical struggle with, he had no
fear of this fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;There's good nerve, for you!&#8221; remarked a
soldier, admiringly.  &#8220;How do you like it, Coggins?&#8221;  It was evident that this particular soldier, Coggins, was not very well liked by his
comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I'm a fool, to get myself
laughed at for engaging in a fight with a green
country boy?&#8221; growled Coggins.  &#8220;I'll do no
such thing.&#8221;  Rising, he walked away with a
swagger, but he gave <span class="name.char">Dick</span> a look of hatred as
he did so.</p>

<p>A number of the soldiers grinned, and two or
three chuckled aloud, and unless Coggins was
deaf, he must have heard them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you really have fought him?&#8221; queried
a soldier, looking at <span class="name.char">Dick</span> keenly, when Coggins
was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he attacked me, I should have protected myself,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you couldn't have done much against
him.  You're only a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know about that.  I am pretty strong
and am also rather active, and I have wrestled
with a number of grown men, and never found
one yet that I couldn't down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you might have held your own with
Coggins, but I doubt it a little.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Better be a bit careful how you ruffle him,
young man,&#8221; said another soldier.  &#8220;He's a
vicious chap when his anger is aroused, and he
would not hesitate to do you serious injury.  He
gave you a look I noticed that was not exactly
friendly, as he left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed that, too,&#8221; smiled <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;But I do
not fear him.  I shall not try to anger him, but
if he annoys me, I will take my own part,
that is certain.  I won't let him run over
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's right, of course,&#8221; approvingly.  &#8220;But
don't get into trouble with him if you can avoid
it without discredit to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won't, sir, and thank you for your friendly
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You're welcome.  I don't like Coggins myself, and I don't care who knows it.  He knows
it, all right, I guess,&#8221; with a short laugh.  The
fact was, though of course <span class="name.char">Dick</span> knew nothing
of it, that this soldier, whose name was Ferguson, and the other, Coggins, were enemies, having had an encounter once, in which Ferguson
had gotten rather the best of it, though the
fight did not go to a finish, it having been
stopped by order of the colonel.</p>



<p>Soon the soldiers stretching themselves on blankets and going to sleep.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
was given a blanket, and he also lay down,
being quite tired by this time, and was soon
asleep.</p>

<p>The fact that he was in the encampment of
the enemy did not have any effect on <span class="name.char">Dick's</span>
nerves at all.  He was a brave and matter-of-fact youth, and felt the boldest plan was the
safest, and so he was enabled to act with as
much <span class="foreign" style="font-style: italic">sang froid</span> as if he were really an adherent
of the king and sincere in his desire to fight for
him.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> ate breakfast with the rest of the soldiers of his company, then he looked about them,
and over the encampment, with interest.  It was
very interesting indeed to the boy patriot spy
and he was eager to see all that there was to be
seen.</p>

<p>He noted that this was in itself quite an encampment, but realized that it was only one
portion of the whole.  He wished to get the
other divisions located, and desired also to learn
how many soldiers there were in the entire
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> army.  He asked questions, carefully, in
such a manner as not to create suspicion, and
gradually became possessed of considerable information that he felt must be reliable, since
there could be no occasion for those who gave
him the information to deceive him, they believing him to be loyal to the king and a soldier
the same as they were.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock Company H. was ordered
to proceed to the beach for the purpose of
allowing the soldiers to bathe, and they set
out at once, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> accompanying them, of
course.  On the way they passed another division of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> army, and <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was informed by a companion that it was the main
body.</p>

<p>When they neared the beach, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> caught
sight of several old hulks of vessels at anchor
near the shore, and he inquired what they
were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old hulks of dismantled ships,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;We use them for prisons for those of the
rebel army that we capture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any rebels in there now?&#8221; queried
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, making his tone as careless as possible,
though having his father in mind, his heart was
throbbing with eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there are a number in there–fifteen or
twenty, I should judge.  They are in the hulk
farthest to the north.  Among them are three
or four rebel spies who will likely be shot or
hanged sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick's</span> heart thrilled as he heard this news.
Perhaps he might be able to rescue all those
poor, suffering patriot prisoners!  He made up
his mind that he would try, at any rate.  And
again the thought struck him that his father
might be imprisoned there.  He at once decided
that he would visit the prison ship and rescue
the prisoners, if possible.</p>

<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="name.char"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">D</span>ick</span> Dare</span> eyed the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> fleet with interest.  It lay in the roadstead, just off
York Bay, and the sight of the warships was
indeed alluring.  He asked questions about the
fleet, being careful to inquire as if actuated
merely by curiosity, and he also managed to
secure information as to the number of soldiers
in the army on shore.  He was told that the
army, as a whole, had about twenty-four thousand men in its ranks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew, that outnumbers our army considerably!&#8221; thought <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;Well, no matter, when it
comes to battle, I'll wager that we will give
the redcoats all they can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Company H. had finished bathing, the
soldiers marched back to the encampment, and
other companies were met on their way to the
beach to take their turn in the water.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> was on the alert for information all the
rest of that day.  He did not learn much more,
for he found that there was no intention of attacking the patriot force on <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>
very soon, exactly the point on which <span class="name.char">General
Washington</span> wished to be informed.  He became
convinced that it would be useless to remain
longer in the hope of securing further information, as no date for an attack had been decided
upon.</p>

<p>He turned his attention therefore to the
problem of how if possible to rescue the
patriot spies and soldiers that were in the old
hulk used for a prison.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must rescue them!&#8221; was his thought.  &#8220;I will
rescue them!&#8221; he decided, and he began figuring
on the matter in earnest and laying his plans.</p>

<p>About half-past one o'clock in the afternoon,
however, he was given a shock:  He saw half
a dozen <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers approaching the encampment from the north, and in their midst
was–his brother <span class="name.char">Tom</span>!</p>

<p>&#8220;They've captured <span class="name.char">Tom</span>!&#8221; he exclaimed
mentally, in dismay.  &#8220;Goodness, that is bad!
I wonder how it happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a simple matter.  The half dozen
redcoats had been up in the hills nearby the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span>, where <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> had had the adventure the night before, when in passing the
clump of trees, some one of them happened to
catch a glimpse of <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, who was seated under
a tree, eating some food that he had procured t
a farmhouse early that morning.  The soldiers
had advanced, and their sudden appearance had
startled <span class="name.char">Tom</span> to such an extent that when they
asked who he was and what he was doing there,
he stammered and was unable to make a satisfactory reply offhand, with the result that the
redcoats seized him and made him a prisoner,
their idea being that even though he were a boy
he might be a &#8220;rebel&#8221; spy.</p>

<p>As may well be supposed, when <span class="name.char">Dick</span> saw the
redcoats approaching with his brother a prisoner in their midst, his heart sank.  He had
been figuring on getting his brother to help him
in rescuing the patriot spies and soldiers, and
here was <span class="name.char">Tom</span> in the enemy's hands, a prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll have to begin by rescuing <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, I guess,&#8221;
was <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> thought.</p>

<p>The soldiers entered the encampment, with
the youth in their midst, and conducted him to
where in front of his tent the general was sitting on a camp-stool.  The officer looked up as
the party approached, and he eyed the prisoner
in some surprise.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> had drawn near as the soldiers entered
the camp, and had managed to catch <span class="name.char">Tom's</span> eye
and give him a warning look.  He hoped that
his brother would be very careful, and not let it
be seen that they were known to each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom have you there?&#8221; queried <span class="name.char">General
Percy</span>, as the party came to a halt in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We found this youngster over yonder in that
bit of woods, <span class="name.char">General Percy</span>,&#8221; said one of the
soldiers.  &#8220;He was sitting there, eating a lunch,
and when we appeared and asked him who he
was and where he came from, he seemed frightened and could make no satisfactory answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn't frightened, any such thing!&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>, his eyes flashing.  &#8220;I am not frightened
even now, sir.   I was surprised, for they came
upon me so suddenly, and the leaped at me as
if I were a desperado, and naturally I may have
seemed a bit confused in my answers to their
questions.  But I wasn't frightened, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something like a grim smile appeared for an
instant on the general's face, as he looked at the
bright face of the boy.</p>



<p>&#8220;So you were not afraid, eh?&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Well, if you are not a rebel spy or an enemy
to the king, there is no reason that you should be
afraid.  What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>, sir.&#8221;  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> had given his real
name to the soldiers, but had wished afterward
that he had given a fictitious one.  Now he
could do nothing other than give his own name.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>, eh?  Well, Master <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>,
where do you live?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy hesitated an instant, and then said:
&#8220;I live over in New Jersey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, in New Jersey?  Well, what are you
doing over here on <span class="name.place">Long Island</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to see the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> army, sir, and so
I came over here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed?  Why did you wish to see the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just out of curiosity, sir.  I have never before seen an army, and I wanted to see one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Percy</span> eyed the boy searchingly for a
few moments, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me you have come good ways
to satisfy a feeling of curiosity.  Your action
is a little bit unusual.  You appear to have an
inquiring mind.&#8221;  There was something in his
tone that <span class="name.char">Tom</span> did not just like.  It had a
threatening sound.  However, he kept a bold
face, and said as calmly as possible:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said the general after a few moments, &#8220;that you have so much curiosity,
you would like to see all that you possibly can.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> still did not fancy the general's tone and
air, but he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;True, sir.  So I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.  Such being the case, I have no
doubt that you would like to see the interior of
one of the old hulks down at the bay, that we
use as prisons for rebel spies and other prisoners.  I am going to send you down there, my
boy, and I hope you will like the looks of things
there, for you will probably be there some time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> started and turned slightly pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you are not going to make me a
prisoner there, sir!&#8221; he exclaimed in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I am going to do, Master
<span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>!&#8221; was the reply in a stern tone.
&#8220;The fact is, I believe you are a rebel spy.  Your
explanation of your presence here, when your
home is over in New Jersey is not satisfactory
at all.  I am certain that you have an ulterior
motive in coming, and the only motive that I
can think of is that you came to engage in spy-work.  Take him to the prison at once, men,&#8221;
this last to the soldiers.</p>

<p>Poor <span class="name.char">Tom</span>!  He knew it would be hopeless to
expostulate.  He felt that he was doomed to become an inmate of one of the prison-ships, and
as he thought it would be useless he said not a
word, but accompanied the soldiers without
making any show of resistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him past the other encampments and
let him see the whole army,&#8221; called <span class="name.char">General
Percy</span> after them.  &#8220;When one has as much
curiosity as he seems to be possessed of, it
should be satisfied.&#8221;  This was sarcasm and
intended to hurt <span class="name.char">Tom's</span> feelings and humiliate
him, but instead it only aroused a feeling of
resentment in his breast, and almost before he
realized what he was saying, he exclaimed aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;I'd like to kick him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, the general?&#8221; queried one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, boldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You'd better not let him hear you say anything like that, sonny!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Say, comrades,&#8221; remarked another, maliciously, &#8220;let's go back and tell the general what
he said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, let's not,&#8221; said another.  &#8220;The general
would whip out his sword and cut the boy's head
off.  Come on; it will be punishment sufficient
to be incarcerated in the old prison-ship, even
if he is a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you're right about that, comrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it was me,&#8221; spoke up another, &#8220;I believe
I'd rather have my head cut off and be done
with it, than to be imprisoned in that old hulk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you're about right,&#8221; agreed the first
speaker.  &#8220;I certainly would hate to have to
change places with you, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> decided that the prison-ship must be a
terrible place, and he was destined to soon find
that such was really the case.</p>

<p>They passed the main encampment of the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span>, as they went to the beach, and the
patriot youth thought that the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> would be
hard to defeat, with such a strong army.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be fifteen or twenty thousand
soldiers there&#8221; was his estimate.</p>

<p>Soon the little party was at the beach, and
getting into the old row-boat, the soldiers rowed
out to the hulk furthest north, and assisted <span class="name.char">Tom</span>
to the deck. Here they found a <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldier
on guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got there, comrades?&#8221; this
soldier asked, looking at <span class="name.char">Tom</span> in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another prisoner, Hawkins.  He is only a
boy, but the general is of the opinion that he is
a rebel spy, so down he goes into the hold with
the rest of the rebels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; down with him.  But I wouldn't
think the rebels would send out such a young
one to do spy-work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the general thinks he's a spy, and that
settles it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly does so far as I am concerned.
Down with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hatch was opened, and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> was assisted
down the ladder to the bottom of the hold, and
then leaving him there, with his hands still tied
together behind his back, the soldiers mounted
the ladder and put the hatch in place, leaving
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> in complete darkness.</p>

<p>As he realized his situation, a shudder went
over the youth's form.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't like this!&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">D</span>ick</span> Dare had been afraid that <span class="name.char">General
Percy</span> might connect him with <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, and
suspect that they were in the neighborhood together, but such a thought evidently did not
come to the commander, for happily he seemed
to dismiss the matter from his mind when the
soldiers departed with the boy.  He again
busied himself with some writing.</p>

<p>When <span class="name.char">Dick</span> noted this, he breathed a sigh of
relief.  It would have been bad indeed had he
been then suspected and made a prisoner, the
same as had been the case with <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  With
them both in the old prison-hulk, escape would
have been difficult, in fact well-nigh impossible,
but with <span class="name.char">Dick</span> free to work from the outside, it
was different.  The youth believed that he
might be able to rescue his brother and the
other prisoners in the prison-ship, and he was
fully decided to make the attempt that very
night.</p>

<p>The afternoon dragged slowly along.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
could hardly wait for nightfall, for he was eager
to get to work.  He thought the afternoon never
would end.</p>

<p>But it did, at last, and after he had eaten
supper, he began mentally reviewing the task
that lay before him.  The first thing to do
would be to get away from the encampment,
and he decided to do this at once.  He had laid
his plans, and going to the colonel, he asked
permission to take a walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not used to camplife, sir,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;and I feel the need of a little exercise.  If not
contrary to the rules, I would like to take a
walk of a mile or so in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it will be all right,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;Go ahead, but don't stay too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won't, sir.  Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> walked boldly out of the encampment,
and in order to disarm suspicion, in case his
action should occasion comment, he went toward the east.  To have started north might
have aroused suspicion that he was heading
for New York.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where away, comrade?&#8221; queried the sentinel
at the east side of the encampment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, out for a little walk for exercise,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right<span title=",">.</span>  The Countersign is &#8216;The King Rules&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;I'll not forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked slowly on, as if merely taking a
leisurely stroll, but as soon as he was out of
sight of the sentinel and others, he changed to a
swift pace, and turning, headed toward the
prison-ships in the bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for business!&#8221; he murmured, grimly.
&#8220;I'll have the patriot prisoners out of that old
hulk before many hours, or I'll know the reason
why!&#8221;</p>

<p>He hastened onward, but paused frequently
and listened intently.  He did not want to meet any
force of <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers then for it would have
been awkward work explaining his presence.</p>

<p>He was fortunate, however, in that he did not
encounter any redcoats, and in considerably
less than an hour he was at the shore, near
where the prison-ships were anchored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the next thing is to get aboard the
hulk,&#8221; was <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> thought.</p>



<p>This would be difficult, for the reason that
there was a sentinel on the deck.  To reach the
hulk and climb aboard without being seen by
this sentinel was a task that would be hard to
accomplish.  But <span class="name.char">Dick</span> did not hesitate.  He was
brave, and eager to rescue his brother and the
other patriot spies and soldiers, and so he located an old boat, got in, and then pulled slowly and
carefully toward the prison-ship, which could
be faintly seen looming up a couple of hundred
yards distant on the water.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> felt that the chances were that the
sentinel would have his attention directed toward the shore, and so he made a half-circuit
and approached from the other side.  He rowed
slowly and cautiously, making scarcely any
noise at all, and was successful in reaching the
hulk without having been discovered.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> had
rightly guessed that the sentinel was at the
other side, doubtless keeping a lookout shoreward.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> felt around in the boat, and found a
rope-ladder, with hooks on one end, and with
the aid of a boathook, he managed to get the
hooks caught over the ship's rail.  This accomplished, he stood there and listened intently.
He feared he might have been heard by the
sentinel.</p>

<p>Such did not seem to be the case, however,
for all was quiet aboard, and presently the
youth began making his way slowly and
cautiously up the ladder.  He kept on till his
head was even with the top of the rail, and then
he gazed about, trying to locate the sentinel.
It was so dark, however, that he could not see
the redcoat, and feeling that the coast was
reasonably clear, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> climbed on up, and over
the rail, and a moment later stood on the deck.</p>

<p>So far all was well.  He had escaped from the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment, had reached the prison-hulk, and was on board.  Now to overpower
the sentinel and rescue the prisoners.</p>

<p>The youth paused only long enough to tie the
boat's painter to the rail, and then he slowly
and cautiously made his way along the deck,
going toward the bow.  He reached the end of
the cabin, moved quietly around it, and then
started in the other direction.  He went with
still greater caution now, for he realized that at
any moment he might come upon the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> sentinel.</p>



<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> knew that there were two soldiers on
board all the time, and that they took turns at
standing guard, so one would be on deck and
the other would likely be in the cabin asleep.
To capture the one guard, without making a
noise that would be heard by the other would be
a difficult matter, but <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was not the kind
of youth to be dismayed by difficulties.
Their presence only made him the more determined.</p>

<p>He advanced carefully, and suddenly he
caught sight of a shadowy form a few feet
ahead of him.  It was the sentinel, undoubtedly, and luckily for <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, the redcoat's back was
partially toward him, and the soldier was gazing in almost the opposite direction from that
in which <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was approaching.</p>

<p>The youth, after a keen survey of the form,
decided that the redcoat's back was toward him,
and so advanced a couple of steps, as silently as
a shadow.  He was now close upon the man, and
reaching out suddenly, he grasped the fellow by
the throat with both hands, and raising his
knee quickly, struck the soldier in the small of
the back, and threw him with a twisting motion
to the deck; then dropping upon the fallen man,
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> compressed his windpipe, gripping it with
all his might.</p>

<p>Although but eighteen years of age, <span class="name.char">Dick
Dare</span> was stronger than the majority of men.  He
was naturally powerful, and his life on the farm
had been such as to develop his strength and
endurance, and so it happened that he was
easily more than a match for the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldier.
The fact that this fellow had been taken completely by surprise worked to his disadvantage,
too, and although he struggled hard, he was unable to do anything, and the gripping fingers,
compressing his windpipe like bands of steel,
gradually weakened him, for he was unable to
get his breath.  Neither could he cry out, and
the result was that in about three minutes from
the time <span class="name.char">Dick</span> had seized the redcoat, the fellow
was lying unconsciously on the deck–choked into
insensibility.</p>

<p>Feeling confident the sentinel would remain
unconscious some time, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> left the form lying
there, and entered the cabin in search of the
other soldier.  A snore sounding from a stateroom at one side guided the youth, so he entered
the compartment, and seizing this redcoat by
the throat, as he had the other, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> quickly
choked him into limp insensibility.  This accomplished, he went out on deck, dragged the
other redcoat into the cabin, and into the stateroom.  Closing the door, he locked them in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think they will be able to get out of
there, even if they regain consciousness before
I get to the prisoners,&#8221; thought <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>Then he went out on deck again and hunted
around till he found the hatchway.  Removing
the covering, he looked down into the hold, but
could see nothing, the darkness there being
even greater than on the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, down there!&#8221; he called.  &#8220;Are you
there, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Dick</span>!  Oh, is it really you?&#8221; came the reply,
in the excited voice of <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is I,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;How many are
there with you, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>?  Is father there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, father isn't here.  Come down and
free us, quick!&#8221; eagerly.  &#8220;There are twelve of
us here, it is a terrible place,–slimy and foul-smelling, and there are rats, insects and worms,
ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Climb up the ladder,&#8221; instructed <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.
&#8220;Surely you are not bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our hands are tied.  That's what I meant
by telling you to come down and free us, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll be with you in moment, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> hastened down the ladder, and was soon
standing beside <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, who had scrambled to his
feet.  He quickly cut the rope binding his
brother's wrists, and then asked where the
other prisoners were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; replied a hoarse voice.  &#8220;We are
right at hand, <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>, and glad to welcome
you.  Your brother has told us about you, and
we have been hoping you would succeed in freeing us, though we feared you might not be able
to do so.  But you seem to have succeeded,
thank God!  I am <span class="name.char">Joseph Boswick</span>,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;one of the spies sent down here by
<span class="name.char">General Washington</span> to secure information regarding the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.  There are three more
spies, and seven patriot soldiers and all of us
are eager to get out of this terrible hole, as you
may well believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can easily believe it, <span class="name.char">Mr. Boswick</span>, and I'll
have your hands free in a jiffy, and then you can
climb the ladder to the deck, and we will go
ashore in the boat.  The two <span class="name.nationality">British</span> guards are
insensible, and locked in a stateroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a wonder, Dare!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Boswick</span>,
admiration in his tone.  &#8220;Well, cut our bonds
quickly and we'll try to get out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was speedily done, and a few minutes
later the entire party was on the deck.  To
climb down into the boat was a simple matter,
but it had only just been accomplished when
there came the noise of oars in rowlocks, from
the other side of the hulk, followed by the sound
of voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some redcoats have come off to the ship,
from the shore!&#8221; whispered <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, to <span class="name.char">Boswick</span>.
&#8220;We must get away from here in a hurry, for
your escape will be discovered very quickly!&#8221;</p>

<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">W</span>e</span> had better get to the shore at once,&#8221;
was the reply.  &#8220;This boat is so heavily loaded that it would be dangerous to try to
go to New York in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it is old and leaky, anyway.  We'll
go ashore and then head for <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> turned the oars and rowed cautiously toward the island.  The boat moved very slowly,
for it was deep in the water, and rapid progress
was impossible.</p>

<p>The shore was reached presently, however,
and at the same instant there came out of the
darkness excited yells from the direction of the
prison-ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;They've discovered your escape,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.
&#8220;Get ashore, men, as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rescued patriots leaped ashore as fast
as they could, and then with <span class="name.char">Dick</span> in the lead,
they set out northward.</p>



<p>&#8220;By keeping over pretty close to the water, I
think we shall be able to keep clear of the redcoats,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely,&#8221; agreed <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;We mustn't let them
capture us now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll never go back to that terrible prison-pen alive!&#8221; declared <span class="name.char">Boswick</span>.  &#8220;I would much
rather die fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We'll get to the <span class="name.city">Heights</span> and then over to
New York in safety,&#8221; assured <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>The excited voices of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> who had
discovered the escape of the prisoners could be
heard for some time, but gradually grew
fainter, until at last no sound could be heard.
The little party kept steadily onward, and
managed to get past the left end of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
army and an hour or so later arrived at the
patriot encampment on <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>.</p>

<p>They paused there only long enough to rest a
bit and apprise the officer in command of their
escape from the prison-ship, then they went
down to the shore and were taken across to the
New York side in boats.</p>

<p>They went direct to patriot headquarters, and
were quickly ushered into the presence of the
commander-in-chief.  When he saw <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>, and also <span class="name.char">Boswick</span> and the other spies and
the patriot soldiers that had been prisoners, his
face lighted up with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely have succeeded well, Dare!&#8221;
he exclaimed.  &#8220;You have rescued the
patriot prisoners from the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> prison-ship,
and I hope you have as well secured some important information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have secured some information, your excellency,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;And I am pleased because I was able to free the patriots from the
prison-ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>–wonderfully
well.  I congratulate you, my boy.&#8221;  Then he
shook hands with <span class="name.char">Boswick</span> and the other spies
and the soldiers and asked them about their
experience in the prison-ship.  According to
their words, the prison-ship was a terrible
place, the bottom of the hold being water-soaked and slimy, and infested by myriads of
insects and worms, which crawled  over the
prisoners' bodies, stinging and biting them
and almost driving them wild.  There were
large and vicious rats also.  The prisoners
were thin and gaunt, and it was evident that
they had suffered indeed.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have had a very unpleasant experience,
men,&#8221; said the commander-in-chief; &#8220;but now
you are free and will soon be your old selves
again.  Go to your quarters, get some food and
then rest up and regain your lost strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldiers obeyed, all going save <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, who
remained at the command of <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>.  When the others had gone, he turned inquiringly at <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you learn, my boy?&#8221; he queried.
&#8220;Have you secured any information of value?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven't secured a great deal of information, your excellency,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;I
learned the numerical strength of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
army, for one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is important.  What is the number?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sober, thoughtful look settled over the face
of the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is about five thousand more than I
figured on,&#8221; he murmured.  &#8220;Well, I am glad
to have knowledge of their strength, even
though it is greater than I had expected it to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I learned also, that an attack on <span class="name.city">Brooklyn
Heights</span>, while a probability at some future
time, is not contemplated at an early date.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That is important also, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  Well, did you
learn anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing else, sir.  But, if you desire it, I
will go back over onto <span class="name.place">Long Island</span> and will
keep watch on the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> and do my best to
learn of any intended move early enough to get
the news to you, so that you will have time to
make a move that will check the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will wait a few days, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and then I
may send you again.  I congratulate you on the
success of your first attempt at spying.  You
did well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, exceedingly well, and I shall
doubtless make use of you frequently in the
future, if you care to undertake the work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to do so, your excellency.
My only wish is to do all in my power to aid the
people of <span class="name.state">America</span> to secure their independence,
and if I can be of value by doing spy-work, then
I shall take pleasure in doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the right spirit, my boy, and I shall
call upon you whenever I have work that I
think you can do better than an older man
could do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he dismissed <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, who saluted and
withdrew, going to his quarters.</p>

<p>He found <span class="name.char">Tom</span> there, engaged in telling the
story of his and <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> adventures over on
<span class="name.place">Long Island</span>, and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> and the other soldiers
were listening eagerly, their eyes shining.  They
greeted <span class="name.char">Dick</span> joyously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I wish I had been with you two fellows,
old man,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>.  &#8220;You have got the
bulge on the rest of us, and that isn't fair.
You have already encountered the redcoats and
had adventures with them, while the rest of us
have had to stay cooped up here in the city.&#8221;
<span class="name.char">Ben</span> pretended to be vexed with <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,
but it was only pretense.</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys will get all the adventure you
want, one of these days, I think,&#8221; smiled <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.
&#8220;There is going to be a battle over on Long
Island sooner or later, and then you will get
all the fighting you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurroo!&#8221; cried <span class="name.char">Tim Murphy</span>, &#8220;shure an'
thot is phwat we are afther wantin', Oi dunno.
It's all av us wull foight to the last gasp, sure
an' we wull.&#8221;</p>

<span class="name.char">Fritz Schmockenburg</span>.  &#8220;Ve are nod avraid uf

<p>&#8220;How soon will the battle take place, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221;
queried <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>.</p>



<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that I cannot say, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;But it will come soon enough, without doubt,
for the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> have twenty-five thousand soldiers, while we have not more than eighteen
thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is pretty big odds,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, with a
shake of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; agreed <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;But the patriots
will give a good account of themselves when
the time comes, I feel certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah, ve vill gif ein goot accound mit mysellufs,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Fritz</span>, the <span class="name.nationality">Dutch</span> soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just listen to thot, wull yez?&#8221; remarked
<span class="name.char">Tim</span>, scathingly.  &#8220;Shure an' there is agotism
fur yez!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope all of us will always give a
good account of ourselves,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, quietly.
&#8220;And I believe we will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We'll try to, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, earnestly.</p>

<p>A few days later <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> again
summoned <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and told him to go over on
<span class="name.place">Long Island</span> and see if he could learn anything
regarding the intentions of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to be very careful, this time,
however, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; he cautioned; &#8220;for you are
known to many of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, and if they
should see you, they would capture you, and
that would be bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, sir,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;I will be very careful.  I will not let them capture me, if I can
help myself.&#8221;  Then, after receiving his instructions, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> saluted and withdrew.</p>

<p>After supper he set out, and crossing the
East River, made his way in the direction of
the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment, which was about five
miles distant, to the southward.  He did not
need to go to <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span> to see <span class="name.char">General
Putnam</span>, for the reason that he now knew more
about the location of the enemy than <span class="name.char">Putnam</span>
did.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> did not walk rapidly, for he felt that it
were better to proceed with caution, for if he
went too swiftly he could not exercise much
care, and the result might be unpleasant, as
there was danger that he might run into a party
of <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.  By going slowly he could avoid this
danger.</p>

<p>Two hours from the time he crossed the East
River, he was in the vicinity of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment, and he moved slowly around it,
trying to figure out some way to get where he
could secure information, but to no avail.  He
could not devise any means of doing this.  To
enter the lines was out of the question, for
there would likely be some of the soldiers who
would recognize him as the youth who had
joined the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> army a few days before and
then deserted.  Doubtless the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> were
aware of the fact, also, that the same youth
had set the prisoners free from the prison-ship.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> remained near the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment
till after midnight, but could do nothing to
further the purpose for which he had come, and
so he retired to a clump of trees situated about
a quarter of a mile from the edge of the encampment, and hunting up a place under some
bushes, lay down and went to sleep.</p>

<p>He slept soundly till morning, and then got
up and took a survey of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment.  The sun was just rising, and everything
was quiet in the camp.  The soldiers were still
asleep, with the exception of the sentinels, who
could be seen slowly pacing their beats.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> had nothing to eat, but did not let that
bother him.  He was prepared to go without
food all day, if by so doing he would have a
better chance of securing information regarding
the enemy.  He watched till the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers
got up and ate their breakfast, and then as he
saw small groups moving about, some coming
almost to the clump of trees, he decided that it
would be best to climb up into a tree and conceal himself amid the leaves, and selecting a
tree with very heavy foliage, he climbed well
up into it.  Here he took up as comfortable a
position as possible, watching the enemy and
awaiting developments.</p>

<p>All was quiet till noon, and then as he saw the
soldiers eating their dinners, he was assailed
by a feeling of hunger.  He resolutely dismissed
the thought of food, however, and stuck to his
position.  He was determined to stay till evening, at any rate, and then if he had not secured
any information, he would go to a farmhouse
which he saw about a mile distant, to the eastward, and get something to eat, after which he
would return to his post.  He was determined
to remain in the vicinity of the army till he
learned something of value in the way of news
regarding the intentions of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, if it took
him a week.</p>

<p>He climbed down out of the tree presently
and walked about, in the thicket, stretching in
legs and feeling much better afterward, for
his position had been a cramped one at the
best.</p>

<p>When the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers began moving
around again, after dinner, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> climbed up
into the tree once more, for some of the redcoats might visit the clump of trees at any time.
A party of four of the soldiers did enter the
thicket an hour or so later, and throwing themselves down in the shade, talked and laughed
for some time, but although <span class="name.char">Dick</span> listened with
intense eagerness, no words were spoken that
gave him any information.  If the soldiers knew
of any intended move on the part of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
army, they did not mention the fact in their
conversation, which was made up of idle talk,
of the kind as such men would naturally indulge in.</p>

<p>When they left and returned to the encampment <span class="name.char">Dick</span> drew a breath of relief, for he felt
that every minute they remained in the clump
of trees he was in danger of discovery.  He
might make a noise, in shifting his position, and
be heard, or he might have to sneeze, or cough.
And if he were to be discovered, it would go
hard with him, for he would undoubtedly be
deemed a spy.</p>

<p>After the redcoats returned to the encampment, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> descended to the ground and walked
about a while, being careful to keep the most
of the thicket between himself and the enemy.
After half an hour on the ground, he again
climbed up into the tree.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> began to think the day was to be barren
of results, as evening drew near; but a little
while before sundown he caught sight of a
couple of soldiers approaching the clump of
trees.  As the two drew near, he got a fair view
of their faces, and he had all he could do to
keep from uttering an exclamation, for–the two approaching <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers were no
others than <span class="name.char">Zeke Boggs</span> and <span class="name.char">Lem Hicks</span>, <span class="name.char">Dick's</span>
enemies, the Tory youths from over in New
Jersey!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is a surprise!&#8221; thought <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.
&#8220;But I remember now, that <span class="name.char">Ben</span> said <span class="name.char">Zeke</span> told
him he and <span class="name.char">Lem</span> were going to join the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
army and be <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers, that they were
not going to let <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, and myself get ahead
of them.  I wonder what they would say if they
knew I was so near them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="name.char">Zeke</span> and <span class="name.char">Lem</span>, dressed in the uniform of
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers, entered the clump of timber
and seated themselves on the moss under the
tree next to that <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was in.  They had no
suspicion that there was anyone other than
themselves present, and talked freely of their
plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do ye like army life, anyhow, <span class="name.char">Zeke</span>?&#8221;
asked <span class="name.char">Lem</span>, as they lolled on the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pretty well, <span class="name.char">Lem</span>,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;How
do ye like et?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, only so-so, <span class="name.char">Zeke</span>.  They're too strict ter
suit me.  I don't like ter hev ter come an' go
just ez sumbuddy tells me, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don't.  But when er feller enters the
army, that's jest whut he hez ter do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thet's so.  Well, I guess I'll git used
ter et.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll be glad when we git inter a bettle with
the rebels, <span class="name.char">Lem</span>, won't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so.&#8221;  The tone was not very
decided or enthusiastic.  &#8220;I hope thet ef we do
git inter a battle, we'll meet up with <span class="name.char">Dick</span> an'
<span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span> an' <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I.  I'd like ter giv' 'em a thrashin' in
a battle.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So would I.  An' I guess thet we'll hev a
chance to fight the rebels afore so very long, fur
I heerd our colonel tell another officer thet et
hez be'n decided ter make an attack on <span class="name.city">Brooklyn
Heights</span> the <span title="1776-08-24">twenty-fourth</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard 'im say thet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> made mental note of this date.  He had
learned something of value, and from the lips
of his enemies, <span class="name.char">Zeke</span> and <span class="name.char">Lem</span>.  How angry they
would be if they knew they had done <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>
a kindness!  &#8220;Thank you, <span class="name.char">Zeke</span> and <span class="name.char">Lem</span>,&#8221; he murmured.  &#8220;You are very kind, and have done me
quite a favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two Tory youths remained there half an
hour or so, and then returned to the encampment.  Their conversation had held nothing
further of interest to <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, but what he had
learned was sufficient.  He had learned when
the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> intended to make the attack, and
that was just what he had come over there to
try to learn.  Now he was eager to get back
to New York and tell the commander-in-chief
the news.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dark, he set out for New
York, and reached there a couple of hours later.
He went at once to headquarters, where he told
<span class="name.char">General Washington</span> what he had learned.</p>

<p>The commander-in-chief complimented <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
on his success in securing the information, and
next morning he sent three thousand troops
over to reinforce <span class="name.char">General Putnam's</span> force on
<span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>.  To the delight of <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>
and <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, <span class="name.char">Colonel Morgan's</span> regiment was among
those sent, and the youths would thus be able
to take part in the battle.</p>

<p>When the <span title="1776-08-24">24th</span> arrived, however, the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
did not make the expected attack, and about
mid-day <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> came over to the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span> and conferred with <span class="name.char">Putnam</span>, and <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
was asked his opinion regarding the non-appearance of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't understand it, sir,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;I
heard the two Tory youths say that an attack
would be made on the <span title="1776-08-24">twenty-fourth</span>.  Perhaps
the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> have learned that you were expecting them, and have postponed the attack on that
account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is possible,&#8221; agreed <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>.  &#8220;Well, the only thing to do, now, is to
keep constantly on the lookout and be ready all
the time to repulse an attack.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That is the proper course, your excellency,&#8221;
said <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.</p>

<p>So it was decided to remain in readiness, and
to keep out double the usual number of
sentinels, so as to avoid being taken by surprise.</p>

<p>This course was adopted, and the patriots
kept in readiness for instant battle, and waited
with what patience they could muster, pestered
as they were by the hot weather and myriads
of mosquitoes, for the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> to make an
attack.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 1.2em;">The Haunted House</h2>



<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">L</span>ife</span> in the patriot camp often grew irksome
to the volunteers of <span class="name.char">Washington's</span> army.
All were eager to meet their red-coat foes, and
prove their mettle in a real battle.  Thus far
the troops gathered in New York, had been
forced to content themselves with occasional
skirmishes with the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> outposts, which
little affairs only served to increase their eagerness to &#8220;have it out&#8221; with the invaders.</p>

<p>To make the long days of waiting pass more
pleasantly, frequent excursions were made into
the surrounding country in search of adventures and to pick up whatever delicacies in
the way of fruit and fowl that the outlying
farms afforded.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> appointed himself a committee of one to supply the company to which
he and his friends belonged.  He had exhausted
most of the well-known haunts about camp,
and was in the habit of going off on long
tramps to find the coveted fruit.</p>

<p>One evening toward dusk <span class="name.char">Tom</span> was sauntering along a quiet country road hunting for
apples.  In the course of his wanderings he
came upon a well laden tree standing on the
grounds of a neglected estate.  Far back
amongst the trees was the deserted mansion-house, looking desolate and forbidding in the
rays of the sinking sun.</p>

<p>About this old place many stories clung of
mystery and violent death.  From the time of
its erection by a runaway nobleman the families who had unfortunately occupied it had
either left in extreme haste and terror for some
far removed section of the country, or had met
with foul play at the hands of a band of Gypsies, who appeared in the neighborhood only
when a new occupant moved into the fated
homestead.  The last family that had lived
there had suddenly left the house one night.
Two grown up sons, however, returned and
told the inquisitive farmers that although their
folks had been frightened away, they proposed
to remain until they had solved the mystery of
the place.  This perhaps they did the next
night, but they both paid for their curiosity
with their lives, for the neighbors found their
bodies suspended from the upper floor over the
Main Stairway.  Since this last fatality, the
house had been deserted, its bad name growing
with each recounting of its dark history.</p>

<p>A little youngster scarce four years old, was
playing under the tree.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> helped himself
to some apples as was his wont, and speaking
cheerily to the boy, learned that his name was
&#8220;Jackie.&#8221;  A stick of candy from <span class="name.char">Tom's</span> pocket
was greedily accepted by Jackie.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> was
feeling blue that day thinking of his father
from whom had come no word, of his mother
and sister, and his old home.  He wandered on
unobservant of the fact that it was growing
dark, and that a storm was fast approaching.
He was suddenly called to a sense of his surroundings by hearing a cry behind him, and
turning back saw that little Jackie was dogging his footsteps.</p>

<p>The youngster was tired out now, and
wanted &#8220;home and mother,&#8221; so <span class="name.char">Tom</span> spoke a
soothing word or two and they commenced to
retrace their footsteps.  He noted now that the
storm was soon to break, and Jackie was too
tired to hurry, so he gathered the little fellow
into his strong arms, and made fast time for
home.</p>



<p>By the time they had reached the apple tree
it was quite dark.  Large drops of rain, the
roar of thunder, and the glare of lightning told
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> that he was none too soon.  He ran
through the unkempt garden, and was quickly
at the door.  A sinister looking place it was
even in daylight, and now revealed by an occasional lightning flash, the house seemed but a
wreck of former stateliness.  Not a light was
visible within, and to <span class="name.char">Tom's</span> loud and hurried
rappings on the door, there was no response.</p>

<p>A flash of lightning however, showed <span class="name.char">Tom</span>
that the door was unlatched, and with the rain
now descending in torrents, he hesitated no
longer, but stepped within.  There was a rush
of wind, a rattle of shutters, a deafening peal
of thunder as if close at hand, and with a crash
the great door suddenly closed.</p>

<p>It did not take <span class="name.char">Tom</span> long to determine that
he and his little charge were alone in a deserted
mansion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this your home, Jackie?&#8221; inquired <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>The little fellow whom <span class="name.char">Tom</span> had placed upon
the floor was thoroughly terrified, and could
only grasp his answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the haunted house, let me go home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Jackie, don't be afraid, but
where is your home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Meantime <span class="name.char">Tom</span> had turned about and was
searching for the handle of the great door.
There was none.  It had been broken off, and
this means of egress was unavailable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let's see if we can find a window,&#8221; suggested <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, but Jackie clung closer to his rescuer and began to cry wildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a ghost, it's coming,&#8221; shrieked the
little fellow.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Tom</span> looked along the depth of the long hall,
and at first saw nothing, then at the next flash
of lightning he was startled to see two green
and glaring eyes fixed upon him.  No thought
of such a thing as a ghost entered his mind,
he was far too sensible for that, and had no
fear of spirits.  If they were good spirits, he
argued, of course they would not hurt, if they
were bad, he might hurt them.  He was for
advancing at once to investigate, but his little
charge clung to him in desperate terror.</p>

<p>Then there came another crash of thunder,
and at the same instant a noise as of an overturned table, and the rattle of pans and pots
upon the floor.  But the eyes, they were gone–no, they were close upon the floor, and
coming toward them.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> could not deny
that he felt a creeping feeling, and poor Jackie,
always observant of the goings on, was simply
overcome with fright, and buried his head in
<span class="name.char">Tom's</span> side to shut out the dreaded sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Jackie, let's get out of here,&#8221; encouraged <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, and having observed a window
in the room to the left, he once more took up
his charge and made for it.</p>

<p>Halfway to his objective point, however, he
was startled for a moment to see revealed by a
lantern the whiskered face of a man on the
other side of the window.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> stopped short
an instant, but not so Jackie, who struggled
from his protector's embrace calling out,
&#8220;There's papa!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a brief interval Jackie was in his parent's
arms, and as they lived next door to the deserted mansion, <span class="name.char">Tom</span> was soon being thanked
time and again for the rescue of the little runaway.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is the house really haunted?&#8221; asked
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>, and then without waiting for a reply
he answered his own question &#8220;but of course
I know it is not.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the laughing response, &#8220;but it
has been unoccupied except by cats, and in
some way has gotten that name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then the eyes we saw–?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite likely a stray cat, but still it would
not be wondered at if your nerves got on edge.
You are a brave boy, <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>, and I know I
shall hear of brave deeds of yours in the
future.&#8221;</p>

<p>The storm had moderated, and <span class="name.char">Tom</span> now
had to hasten back to camp where he was
welcomed for he had for distribution a large
bag of apples, given him by Jackie's father.</p>

<p>That evening about the camp-fire <span class="name.char">Tom</span> recounted his adventures to his friends, and a trip
was planned for the next day to explore the
secrets of the old house.</p>

<p>The following morning, after drill and the
camp duties had been performed, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> set out for the scene of the previous
day's excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't believe half of these &#8216;haunted house&#8217;
stories,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, &#8220;ever since–,&#8221; and here he
stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ever since you thought we had a real
ghost, and suggested leaving the poor spirit to
its own reflection while you and the rest of us
made for home,&#8221; broke in <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221; questioned <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, about a year ago,&#8221; <span class="name.char">Dick</span> responded,
&#8220;four of us spent a night in a house with a
&#8216;haunted&#8217; reputation, and after numerous fake
alarms, caused by the wind shaking the windows or banging the shutters, we at last got
track of the real disturber, who happened along
the very night we were on watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; questioned <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, eagerly,
while <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, remembering his temporary terror
on that night, grew suspiciously red in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;None other than a marauding cat,&#8221; <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
replied, &#8220;whose head had stuck in a can it was
drinking from, and who knocked the unwelcome helmet on the floor in an effort to disengage it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had now reached the old mansion,
and a trip through its ruined rooms failed to
reveal anything unusual, so after gathering
another supply of apples, the three returned to
camp.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 1.2em;"><span class="name.char">Dick</span> Again Does Spy-Work</h2>



<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">A</span>s</span> the days and weeks dragged slowly past
and the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> did not make an attack
on the patriot force on <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>, <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> became somewhat impatient.
He was puzzled by the action, or rather lack
of action of the enemy, and was desirous of
learning what it meant.</p>

<p>There was only one way that this could be
done–by sending a spy to venture among the
enemy and spy upon them, and as <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>
had done good work for him on two former
occasions, the commander-in-chief decided to
try him again.  He had been on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>,
conferring with <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>, on the afternoon of August 20th, and presently he summoned an orderly and told him to tell <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>
to come to headquarters.</p>



<p>The orderly saluted and went in search of the
youth, whom he found in company with his
brother <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, and <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span> and two or three
other soldiers, talking listlessly and wondering
when the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> would make an attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>, you are wanted at headquarters,&#8221; said the orderly.  &#8220;The commander-in-chief sent me to inform you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> leaped up with alacrity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll go at once,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he is wanting you to do some more
spy-work, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; suggested <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so.  I would like to get away from
camp and circulate around awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and get captured again,&#8221; grinned <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.
&#8220;You are not cut out for spy-work, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  You
are too impulsive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don't know about that,&#8221; demurred
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;I'd like to try spying, on my own hook,
once, like <span class="name.char">Dick</span> does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think either of us would be as successful as <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; remarked <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is phwat Oi think,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tim Murphy</span>,
the Irish soldier.  &#8220;Av inywan, now, could come
innywhere near bein' as good at spyin' as <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
phwy <span class="name.char">Fritz</span> here,&#8221; he continued with a grin,
&#8220;would be the mon, Oi'm thinkin'.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Fritz Schmockenburg</span>, the <span class="name.nationality">Dutch</span> soldier,
grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet me dot I vould mage ein better sby as
vot your vould, <span class="name.char">Tim Murphies</span>,&#8221; he said placidly.</p>

<p>And then ensued a good-natured dispute between the two, who, although they <span title="quarreled">quarrelled</span>
frequently, and to one who did not understand
them would seem to be very angry at each other
and enemies in fact, were the best of friends.
And <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> egged the two on, for they
liked to hear them talk, it affording something
in the way of amusement to pass away the time,
which was beginning to hang heavy on their
hands, camp-life being rather dull and trying,
especially to youths like them, who had always been used to an active life in the open
fields.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> had gone to headquarters, and on reaching there, he was given a cordial greeting by
<span class="name.char">Generals Washington</span> and <span class="name.char">Putnam</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sent for me, your excellency?&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, after saluting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;I think that I
shall again call you into requisition.  How
wold you like to again venture out toward the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> lines in search of information?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick's</span> face lighted up eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like it first rate, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so, and that is the reason I sent
for you.  Well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, the fact is, that we are
beginning to grow weary of this state of affairs,
and would like to learn what is detaining the
enemy and causing them to hold back from making an attack.  And we wish to learn, if possible, if an attack is intended soon, and if so, on
what date.  You wish to try your hand at the
work of learning this, my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to make the attempt to secure
the information you wish, <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>,&#8221; was the prompt and earnest reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  Then the matter is settled.  You will leave this evening, as soon as
darkness has come, and will visit the special
spot in the vicinity of the enemy's camp, and
learn all that you possibly can.  There is no
need of my giving you other than these general
instructions, for you have had sufficient experience as a spy to know how to go about it yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your excellency.  I will leave as soon
as it is dark, and will do my best
to secure some information of value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that you may succeed, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a little further conversation <span class="name.char">Dick</span> took
his departure, and rejoined his comrades, who
looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spy-work again, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221; queried <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Ben</span>,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's what we guessed.  When do you
start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could go with you!&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it will be better for me to go alone,&#8221;
said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;I can do better work alone than if
somebody is with me.  The general selected me
because I have a likely place to hide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would it do to take <span class="name.char">Dootchy</span> wid yez,
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>?&#8221; grinned <span class="name.char">Tim</span>.  &#8220;He thinks he would be a
foine spy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> laughed.  &#8220;I don't know how <span class="name.char">Fritz</span>
would make out in that field of endeavor,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is so big he couldn't get within a mile of
the redcoats without their seeing him,&#8221; commented <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that's the only trouble with <span class="name.char">Fritz</span>,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;He is too big to be a success as a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't said dot I vould be a goot sby, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221;
responded <span class="name.char">Fritz</span>.   &#8220;I said dot I vould be as goot
a sby as vot <span class="name.char">Tim Murphies</span> vould be, see? und
I vill stand me by dot statements, alretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, Oi have not said thot Oi would make a
good spy, <span class="name.char">Dootchy</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tim</span>, &#8220;so you wouldn't
have to be much in thot line to aquil me.  But
whin it comes to foightin', now, it's mesilf belaves Oi have yez bate, <span class="name.char">Fritz</span>, me bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don'd vos know abouid dot, <span class="name.char">Tim</span>,&#8221; was
the reply.  &#8220;I think dot I vill do some fighdin'
myselufs alretty, ven ve get der retgoads at,
yahs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; grinned <span class="name.char">Tim</span>.  &#8220;We wull wait
an see how yez act whin we come face to face
wid the ridcoats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you'll both be brave soldiers, no doubt,&#8221;
said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;But, you won't be any ahead of
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, <span class="name.char">Ben</span> and myself.  We intend to do some
fighting, too, when the time comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi'm bettin' thot yez presint a bold face to
the inimy,&#8221; nodded <span class="name.char">Tom</span>, who liked the youths
immensely.  &#8220;An' sure, it's meself is wishin'
thot we get a chance at the ridcoats before very
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, <span class="name.char">Tim</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>Soon after supper, that evening, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> made
his preparations for going on the expedition.
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> cautioned him again and again to be careful, and not take too great risks.  &#8220;I won't be
there to help you, and you will have to depend
on yourself,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be careful,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;But I'm
going to find out when the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> intend to
make an attack, that is, if such a thing is possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that you may succeed, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; encouraged <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll do my best,&#8221; and then saying good-bye
to his friends, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> left the works and set out
down the slope, heading in the direction of the
encampment of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.</p>

<p>He walked at a moderate pace, for there was
no occasion for haste.  He had the whole night
before him.</p>

<p>He walked onward an hour or more, and then
stopped in the same little clump of timber which
had before sheltered him.  Climbing a tree, he
looked toward the south, and saw, not very far
distant, the campfires of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.  The
enemy were still occupying their old quarters.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> did not of course dare venture into the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> encampment, for the reason that he
would be recognized and placed under arrest as
a spy at once, for having pretended to join the
force in question only a few weeks before, and
the redcoats would be only too glad to get their
hands on him now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the best thing I can do is to remain
here till morning,&#8221; was <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> thought.  &#8220;Then
I can get a good view of the encampment, and
possibly some soldiers may come here to the
timber during the day, as they did before, to
loll in the shade, and I may again be able to
hear something of interest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> climbed down out of the tree and lay
down under some bushes and was soon sound
asleep.  That was one thing that made <span class="name.char">Dick</span> a
good person for work of this kind.  He did not
get excited, and could lie down and sleep
soundly almost anywhere, and even with the
redcoats in close proximity to him.</p>

<p>He was up with the sun, next morning, and
after eating a portion of the food he had
brought along with him, he felt refreshed, and
turned his attention again toward the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
encampment.  By climbing the tree, he was enabled to get a good view of the camp, and could
see the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers at work cooking their
breakfast over the campfires.</p>

<p>Away in the distance, toward the bay, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
could make out another encampment, and knew
that this was the main force, under <span class="name.char">General
Howe</span> in person.  There was no clump of trees
near that encampment, however, which made it
difficult of approach for spying purposes, which
was the reason he had come to this division of
the army instead.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> remained up in the tree an hour or so,
and then descended and lay down under some
bushes at the edge of the clump of the trees, on the
side next to the encampment, and kept a sharp
lookout in that direction, watching eagerly for
the coming of some of the soldiers.</p>

<p>One, two hours passed, and then <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> patience was rewarded.  He saw a couple of British soldiers have the encampment and come
strolling in the direction of the clump of trees.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> would have liked to remain on the
ground, but feared that he might be discovered
in case he did so, and thinking it better to be
careful, he once more careful a position as possible, feeling
up as comfortable a position as possible, owing
to the fact that the foliage was very thick.</p>

<p>The two <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers came strolling along,
talking and laughing, and presently they entered the clump of trees and sat down under the
very tree that <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was in.  Here they made
themselves as comfortable as possible, and lighting their pipes, smoked and talked lazily.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> listened eagerly, hoping to hear something that would be in the nature of news, and
of value to <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>, but the soldiers kept their conversation in personal channels, which was not of much interest to <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish they would talk about the army, and
what it intends to do,&#8221; was <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> thought.</p>

<p>But the redcoats did not do this.  They talked
of matters of no importance or interest to <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
and after staying an hour or so, they get up and
returned to the encampment.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> was disappointed.  &#8220;I was in hopes that I
would learn something from their conversation,&#8221;
he muttered.  &#8220;Well, perhaps some more soldiers
will visit the clump of trees to-day, and in that
case I may succeed in securing some information.  I hope that such will be the case, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Noon came, and no other soldiers had visited
the clump of trees.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was not discouraged,
however.  He felt that he would likely get a
chance to hear other soldiers talk that afternoon.</p>

<p>He ate the rest of his food, and then sat down
beside a tree and took it easy for a while.  He
knew that the soldiers were busy cooking their
dinners, and that none would likely come to the
timber for quite a while.</p>

<p>As he sat there, gazing idly over toward the
encampment, however, he suddenly heard footsteps behind him, and turned his head quickly,
and saw a <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldier standing within a few
paces of him, musket in hand, eyeing him suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; greeted the redcoat.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> was surprised and somewhat dismayed
as well, but he was a cool youth, and did not let
the fact that he was flustered show on his face.
Instead, he affected a cool and careless air, and
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello.  Good afternoon, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p>The soldier stood there, keeping a keen eye on
the youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is <span class="name.char">Dick Morris</span>.&#8221;  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> gave the
first name that came to his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph.  What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.  Just sitting here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you sitting here?&#8221;  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> believed
the soldier was suspicious of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm resting,&#8221; replied the youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Resting, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come quite a distance.  I walked here
from nearly twenty miles east, and I'm resting
in the shade, before continuing my journey.  No
objection is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph.  Where are you bound for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over on the shore of the bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going there for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To work for a man, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An old fisherman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph.  You seem to be interested in the
army, yonder, judging by the way you were
looking that way when I came up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, quietly.  &#8220;When one
has never seen an army before, it does interest
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The redcoat eyed <span class="name.char">Dick</span> searchingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm almost inclined to believe that you are
not what you make out yourself to be,&#8221; he said,
after a few moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so, sir?&#8221;  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> opened his eyes as if
surprised and puzzled and looked at the soldier
inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because–in these times of war, it is often
the case that anyone like yourself may turn out
to be a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A spy?&#8221; exclaimed <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, assuming a most
astonished expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and you may be a spy for all I know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> shook his head.  &#8220;Oh, no, you've got
another guess,&#8221; he said.  He felt that he was
doing no wrong in denying being a spy, to a
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not so sure of it,&#8221; was the stubborn
reply.  &#8220;I think that I shall have to take you
into camp and see what <span class="name.char">General Percy</span> has to
say about the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick's</span> heart sank.  <span class="name.char">General Percy</span> was the
officer he had seen, a few weeks before, when he
had pretended to join the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> force, and the
officer would recognize him at once, without
doubt.  It would not do to permit himself to be
taken into the camp, a prisoner.  It would result
disastrously, as he would likely be shot as a spy,
for it was known that he had rescued the patriot
prisoners out of the old prison-ship in the bay,
and he would be handled severely.  Even though
only a boy in years, he had proven himself capable of doing a man's work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn't do that, if I were you,&#8221; said
<span class="name.char">Dick</span>, calmly.</p>

<p>The soldier smiled grimly.  &#8220;I suppose you do
not view the matter favorably,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;But, I think it my duty to take you into camp,
for you may be a dangerous spy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> had been doing some swift thinking, and
he had made up his mind that he must not
permit himself to be taken into the encampment a prisoner.  He must manage in some way
to prevent the soldier from accomplishing this.
The only way, so far as he could see, was to engage the soldier in a struggle, and overpower
him, and as the redcoat looked a pretty
husky fellow, this would likely not be an easy
thing to accomplish.  But <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was more than
ordinarily strong, and he was quick and athletic, and a good wrestler, and he believed he
could overpower the soldier.  He felt confident
he could do so, if he could succeed in taking the
redcoat by surprise.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span>, busy thinking, made no reply to the redcoat's last remark, and the soldier, after waiting
a few moments, said sharply:  &#8220;Get up, young
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> rose to his feet, slowly and quietly.  His
actions were such as would cause the redcoat to
think he did not contemplate offering any resistance, and this was done purposely, so as to
throw the redcoat off his guard.  And it worked
that way, for the soldier, with a careless wave
of the hand, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;March along in front of me to the encampment, young fellow.  We'll see what <span class="name.char">General
Percy</span> thinks about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But <span class="name.char">Dick</span> did not march, as ordered to do.
Instead, he suddenly leaped upon the amazed
soldier, and seizing him by the throat, so as to
prevent his crying out, tripped him, throwing
him to the ground heavily, and then, seated
astride the redcoat's body, and holding him
pinned to the earth in spite of his struggles.</p>



<p>The soldier was a pretty strong man, but he
had been taken at a disadvantage and by surprise, and so was not in a position to exercise
his full powers, and the result was, that although only a youth of eighteen years, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
managed to choke the soldier into a state of
insensibility in a very few minutes.</p>

<p>And then, when confident that the redcoat
was unconscious, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> let go his hold, and proceeded to bind the redcoat's hands and feet, and
gag him.  This accomplished, the youth dragged
the soldier into the deepest and thickest clump
of bushes and concealed him there, so that in
case any soldiers came to the timber, later on,
they would not discover his presence.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this task, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> sat down
beside the tree and drew a long breath of relief
and satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that turned out all right, after all,&#8221; he
murmured.  &#8220;But, I thought at first that I
might be taken into camp a prisoner, and that
would have been bad indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> looked toward the encampment keenly,
as he spoke, and noted that all was quiet there,
and that none of the soldiers were as yet evincing any disposition to visit the clump of timber.</p>



<p>At least an hour passed, and then <span class="name.char">Dick</span> saw
a couple of soldiers leave the encampment and
come toward the timber.  As soon as he was
certain they were coming to loll in the shade of
the trees, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> climbed the tree.  From there
he could hear the conversation of the redcoats,
and there was not much chance that they would
discover his presence, the foliage in the tree as
has been noted, being quite thick.</p>

<p>The two soldiers entered the edge of the timber and seated themselves under a tree close to
the one <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was in, and sat there, smoking and
talking, their conversation being mainly personal, as had been the case with the two that
had been there in the forenoon.  But, after a
while they got to talking about the army, and
finally touched upon the very matter that <span class="name.char">Dick</span>
wish to hear discussed.  In a general way
they commented upon the bustle, stir and
preparation that indicated some important
move.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm glad of it,&#8221; remarked one.  &#8220;I am getting tired of being cooped up in camp.  I'd
rather do some marching and fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I.  Well, I think it likely that we
will have fighting to do in a few days, if the
colonel knew what he was talking about, and I
suppose he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had the news from <span class="name.char">General Percy</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.  The general was over to the
main encampment yesterday, you know, and
likely they held a council of war and decided to
make an attack.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> was straining every nerve to hear distinctly.</p>

<p>Just then a groan sounded, from amid the
clump of bushes in which <span class="name.char">Dick</span> had placed the
soldier he had overpowered.  The soldiers heard
it, and looked at each other wonderingly and inquiringly and then gazed keenly toward the
clump of bushes.  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> had heard the groan
also, and his heart sank, for he thought that if
the soldiers found and released the other redcoat, a search might be instituted for him, and
result in his discovery and capture.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean, comrade?&#8221; remarked
one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody groaned,&#8221; was the reply.  &#8220;Let's
take a look in that clump of bushes and see who
is there, and what ails him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They leaped to their feet, and drawing pistols,
strode to the edge of the clump of bushes, and
stooping, pushed their way through between the
bushes.  A few moments later <span class="name.char">Dick</span> heard an
exclamation from the lips of one of the soldiers,
and knew they had discovered the bound redcoat.  The youth had thought of slipping down
out of the tree and trying to make his escape,
but did not do so, for he realized that the
chances were that he would be seen and
either shot or captured.  So he decided to
remain where he was, and risk being discovered.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the three redcoats
emerged from amid the bushes, the two having
freed the redcoat from his bonds.  They paused
underneath the tree <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was in, and the redcoat
explained about his encounter with and capture
by the person he had suspected of being a spy
and had intended to march into the camp, a
prisoner.  To <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> amusement, the redcoat
described him as being a big, ferocious-looking
fellow, a six-footer, and very strong.  Evidently
the soldier did not want his comrades to know
that he had been overpowered and mad a prisoner by a youth of eighteen years, and smaller
than himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the rascally spy isn't still in this
clump of timer, eh?&#8221; remarked one of the soldiers, with a glance around.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not likely,&#8221; was the reply of the one who
had been made a prisoner.  &#8220;Probably he got
away from here as quickly as possible, after
making a prisoner of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Luckily he was not here to listen to what we
were saying,&#8221; remarked one, and he looked significantly at the other who agreed.</p>

<p>Then one suggested that they go into the encampment and make a report of the affair to the
general.  The other two assented to this proposition, and they at once left the clump of trees
and made their way to the encampment.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> was eager, now, to get away from there.</p>

<p>He felt that he had important if not really
definite information and wished to get it to
<span class="name.char">General Washington</span> as quickly as possible.  He
knew that he might succeed in getting away
from the clump of timber without being discovered, but again there was a chance that he would
be seen and captured, and so he decided to wait
till nightfall, when he could slip away in safety,
and without being in any danger of being seen.
True, the redcoats might come and search the
clump of timber, for the spy the soldier had had
the encounter with, but the youth did not believe they would do so, as they would not think
him likely to linger thereabouts after having
had the struggle with the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldier there.</p>

<p>So <span class="name.char">Dick</span> remained in the timber, and the result justified his judgment, for the soldiers did
not come out again to make a search.  Evidently
it was thought that the spy had taken his
departure.</p>

<p>When night came, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> slipped away and
started in the direction of the patriot encampment on <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>.  He reached there
in safety, a couple of hours later, and at once
went to headquarters and made his report, <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> being there, conferring with
<span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.</p>

<p>When <span class="name.char">Dick</span> told them of the unwonted activities in the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> lines they were well pleased,
and said that if an attack were made they would
be able to hold their position on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>, in
spite of the superior numbers of the enemy.</p>

<p>Next day preparations were begun for the
reception of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, and all was done that
could be to make it possible to offer strong and
successful battle to the enemy.  Then the patriots
waited, as patiently as possible for the coming
of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, who might now come at any time.
The days dragged slowly by, however, and it
was not until the morning of the <span title="1776-08-27">27th of
August</span> that the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> advanced to attack.
Seated in their quarters on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
<span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, and the other soldiers were discussing the matter and wishing that the redcoats would do something, when suddenly the
rattle of musketry was heard, coming from
down on the <span class="name.street">Narrows road</span>, near the bay, where
<span class="name.char">General Stirling's</span> division was stationed.</p>

<p>&#8220;To arms!&#8221; at once shouted <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.
&#8220;The <span class="name.nationality">British</span> are beginning the attack!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly all was excitement.  The soldiers
grabbed their muskets and took their places,
ready for battle, and down where <span class="name.char">Stirling's</span>
force was there sounded the rattle of musketry,
as volleys were exchanged.  It was indeed exciting, and <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span>, their eyes shining, could scarcely contain themselves.  They
wanted to be at the front, helping fight the
redcoats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, ask <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> to let us go
down there,&#8221; pleaded <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>.  &#8220;I want to
help fight the redcoats!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do ask him, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; urged <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.  &#8220;I
can't stand staying here, doing nothing, when
there is fighting going on.  Get him to let us
go down there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I'll try,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  &#8220;I would like
it myself.  But, I'm afraid he won't be willing
to let us go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask him, anyway,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; and <span class="name.char">Dick</span> hastened to <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> and made his wish known.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> listened, but shook his head.
&#8220;No, I can't permit you to go down there,&#8221; he
said.  &#8220;You must stay here with your company.
If it should go, of course you would go too.
But I don't think it will leave the works.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> nodded, a disappointed look on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; he said, and turning, started
to rejoin his comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible that I may make use of you
boys as messengers during the battle, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; the
general said.  He had noted the disappointed
look on the youth's face, and doubtless thought
the idea of being used as messengers would
please the boys.</p>

<p>It evidently pleased <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, for he turned a
beaming face toward the general and said:
&#8220;Thank you, <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.  If you have any
messages to send to the commanders of the
other forces, at the front, we will be glad to
take them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  It is likely that I shall
want to send some messages.  You boys hold
yourselves in readiness to take them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will do so, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then <span class="name.char">Dick</span> hastened back to his comrades and
told them the result of the interview.  They
were slightly disappointed because of not being permitted to go and join the troops already engaged in fighting the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, but were
pleased with the idea of being sent to the commanders with orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> will have a lot of
messages to send,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>, his eyes
shining with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 1.2em;">The Battle of <span class="name.place">Long Island</span></h2>



<p class="firstpara" style="text-indent: 0em"><span class="firstword" style="text-transform: uppercase"><span class="firstletter" style="float: left; font-size: 1.75em;">D</span>own</span> on the <span class="name.street">Narrows Road</span>, <span class="name.char">General
Stirling's</span> force was holding its own
against the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.  The patriot soldiers were
steady and calm, and loaded and fired regularly
and with considerable effect, and had fortune
gone well with <span class="name.char">Sullivan's</span> division, the Continental soldiers would probably have won the battle.
But <span class="name.char">General Sullivan</span>, stationed on the hills
south of Bedford, was attacked fiercely in front
by a strong force of <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, and another force
under <span class="name.char">Generals Howe</span> and <span class="name.char">Cornwallis</span>, having
marched around to the north of this position,
by way of the <span class="name.street">Jamaica Road</span>, attacked <span class="name.char">Sullivan</span>
from the rear, and his force, thus caught between two fires, was driven back and forth
among the trees, with disastrous results.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>, watching the battle from
the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>, through his glass, saw that Sullivan was in difficulties and in danger of capture,
and he decided to send a message to <span class="name.char">Stirling</span>,
warning him of this fact, and ordering him to
retreat toward the <span class="name.city">Heights</span> as quickly as possible–for as soon as <span class="name.char">Sullivan's</span> force was overpowered, the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> would sweep on across the
fields and fall upon the rear of <span class="name.char">Stirling's</span> force
and capture it.  So, having written a brief note,
<span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> summoned <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you can find <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>?&#8221;
the general asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, sir,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is over on <span class="name.street">Narrows Road</span>.  You will
know him, because he will be mounted on a
large bay horse.  Get to him as quickly as possible, and hand him this message,&#8221; and he gave
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> the slip of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do so, <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,
firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good.  Now hurry.  Get there as
quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> hastened away, running swiftly, and as
he passed where <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> were stationed,
he called out:  &#8220;I'm taking a message to <span class="name.char">General
Stirling</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; cried <span class="name.char">Ben</span>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Go it,&#8221; from <span class="name.char">Tom</span>.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> vaulted over the breastworks and then
ran down the slope at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm a messenger from <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>,&#8221;
he called to the sentinel, as he approached the
soldier on duty partway down the slope, and
then on he dashed, without slackening speed in
the least.</p>

<p>Soon he was in among the trees and out of
sight of the patriot soldiers on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>.  He
knew the direction to go in order to reach <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>, and he headed in that direction
and kept up his speed.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> heard the firing over to his left, and
knew this was where <span class="name.char">General Sullivan</span> was
having such a hot fight with the enemy.  The
youth would pass within two or three hundred
yards of the left wing of the attacking <span class="name.nationality">British</span>,
and he kept a sharp lookout in that direction,
for he did not want to get shot by any of the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers.</p>

<p>Presently he caught sight of the right wing
of <span class="name.char">Sullivan's</span> force, and saw the patriot soldiers
firing at the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> as rapidly as possible, and
then he saw the redcoats, who were attacking
the patriots from both the front and the rear.</p>



<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> wished that he might be able to help the
patriot soldiers fight the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, but he had
business of his own to attend to, and so he kept
onward, running at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, when he was perhaps
halfway to the point where <span class="name.char">General Stirling's</span>
army was fighting so bravely, he was given a
surprise, and a most unpleasant one–for he
found himself confronted by a force of <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
soldiers, which was making a flank movement,
with the intention, doubtless, of falling upon
<span class="name.char">Sullivan's</span> right wing.  Doubtless another force
was executing a similar movement on the opposite side, to attack <span class="name.char">Sullivan's</span> left wing, and
when this movement was finished, the soldiers
under <span class="name.char">Sullivan</span> would be surrounded.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> halted instantly, on catching sight of
the approaching soldiers.  He had seen them
while still they were a couple of hundred yards
distant, they being easy to see owing to the
brilliant red of their coats, which stood out
plainly between the trees.  He wondered if he
had been seen.  If not, it might be possible to
escape capture by hiding–if a hiding-place
could be found.  If he were to turn to the right
and run in that direction, with the purpose of
getting around the end of this advancing force,
he would be almost certain to be seen and either
shot down or captured.  Evidently, therefore,
the proper thing for him to do was to hide if
he could find a place of concealment.</p>

<p>But could he do this?  He glanced around
him, eagerly and anxiously.  He was determined to get through the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> ranks and
deliver the message to <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>, if such
a thing were possible.  It would never do to
fail in the very first work that he was given to
do in a battle with the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.  No, he must
reach <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>.  <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> had
shown confidence in <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and the youth was
not going to give the general reason to think
his confidence had been misplaced.</p>

<p>But, where could he hide?  While pondering
this matter, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was standing behind a larger
tree, and on glancing around this tree, to see
how close the redcoats were, the youth noted an
interesting fact:  The tree was hollow.  There
was an opening at least two feet high by a
foot and a half wide, at the bottom, but halfway
around to the other side.  In order to enter
this opening, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> would have to take the
chance of being seen by the approaching <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
soldiers.</p>

<p>It seemed to be his only chance, however, for
he could not hope to run around the end of the
force and escape without being shot down, and
to remain where he was would be to be discovered the instant the soldiers came up to him.</p>

<p>This being settled, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> did not hesitate, but
acted at once.  He dropped to the ground, and
lying on his stomach, wriggled his way around
the tree-trunk, much after the fashion of a
huge snake.  He glanced toward the approaching redcoats, and while he could see them
plainly, they being within seventy-five yards of
him, they had not as yet, he felt certain, discovered him.  This gave him courage, and
quickly he reached the opening and crawled
through it and into the hollow within.</p>

<p>Crouching back as far from the opening as
possible, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> waited anxiously for the coming
of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers.  Had they seen him as
he crawled through the opening?  Would he be
hauled out of the hollow tree and made a prisoner?  <span class="name.char">Dick</span> could not say.  All he could do was
to wait and see what would happen.  If the redcoats had seen him, he would certainly be captured, but if they had not, then he stood a
chance of escaping discovery, and when they
passed, he could continue on his way and deliver the message to <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>.  How
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> wished that this might be the case!</p>

<p>THe moments that intervened before the redcoats reached the vicinity of the tree were anxious ones for <span class="name.char">Dick</span>.  He sat there, crouching
back as far as possible from the opening, and
waited, and as he heard the footsteps and
voices of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> soldiers, his heart came up
into his throat.</p>

<p>It was indeed a critical moment.  It was a
situation to try the nerve of the bravest person.</p>

<p>Louder sounded the footsteps, plainer the
voices of the redcoats.  Closer and closer the
soldiers came, and then some of them appeared
opposite the opening.  <span class="name.char">Dick's</span> heart was in his
mouth.  He held his breath and wondered if
some of the redcoats would stop and haul him
out from his hiding-place.  But no, nothing of
the kind occurred.  It was now evident that he
had not been seen as he was entering the hollow
tree, and the redcoats merely walked past, without looking through the opening, and <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was
not discovered.</p>



<p>Eagerly and thankfully he saw the soldiers
pass, and when they had all gone by, and had
gotten perhaps fifty yards beyond, he stuck his
head out through the opening and took a look
after his enemies.  They were walking swiftly
onward, their faces to the front.  Not one was
looking back, and deeming it was safe, <span class="name.char">Dick</span> crawled
out of his hiding-place, and heaving a sigh of
relief, he again set out in the direction of the
point where <span class="name.char">Stirling's</span> force was giving such
valiant battle to the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>.</p>

<p>On <span class="name.char">Dick</span> ran, at top speed, and presently he
emerged upon the <span class="name.street">Narrows Road</span>, and caught
sight of the patriot force, and also of the British.  The battle between these two divisions of
the armies was still going on, and <span class="name.char">Dick</span> quickly
caught sight of <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>, who was seated
on his big bay charger, watching the progress
of the battle.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span> hastened up to the general, and saluting, said:  &#8220;I have message for you, <span class="name.char">General
Stirling</span>, from <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Stirling</span> took the message and quickly read the few words written there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaimed.  &#8220;<span class="name.char">Sullivan</span> is in sore
straits, being attacked from both front and
rear, and I must retreat, or my force will be
treated to the same fate.&#8221;</p>







<p>Then he turned to <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and said:  &#8220;Tel <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> I will begin retreating toward the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span> at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, and then
he moved away, in the direction from which
he had come, while <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span> gave the
order for his force to beat a retreat.  They
obeyed, though reluctantly, for they did not
know that <span class="name.char">Sullivan's</span> force was practically in
the hands of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>, and so could not understand why the order to retreat was given.
They knew there was a strong force of redcoats over to their left hand, however, and
so they kept a sharp lookout in that direction as they fell back.  They were attacked from that side, by a part of the force, and
<span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>, while fighting valiantly, was
surrounded and made a prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">Dick</span>, from quite a distance, saw the capture
of <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>, and he remained where he
was for a little while, until he saw that the
main force under <span class="name.char">Stirling</span> succeeded in getting
past the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> and were coming toward the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span>, which they would undoubtedly succeed
in reaching, and then he turned and hastened
on up to the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>, and made his way to <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I delivered the message to <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>,
sir,&#8221; the youth said, &#8220;and he told me to say to
you that he would begin a retreat at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Putnam</span>.  &#8220;You did
well to deliver the message.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw his force retreating, sir, from down
the slope a ways,&#8221; went on <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, &#8220;and I saw
some of the redcoats make a prisoner of <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you say, my boy?&#8221; exclaimed <span class="name.char">Putnam</span>.
&#8220;That is bad.  Well, it cannot be helped.  But,
I think the major portion of his force will succeed in reaching the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so, <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span>.  The soldiers are coming steadily, and have got past
the main part of the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for the information, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>,&#8221; said the
general, and then the youth rejoined his comrades at the breastworks.  <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> had
many questions to ask, and he told them briefly
the story of his trip with the despatch.</p>

<p>The soldiers of <span class="name.char">Stirling's</span> force reached and
entered the works on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span> by the time
<span class="name.char">Dick</span> had finished his story, and the battle of
<span class="name.place">Long Island</span> was practically ended, the firing
ceasing very soon afterwards.</p>

<p>The <span class="name.nationality">British</span> army now advanced till in front
of <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>, but it did not attempt to
storm the defenses.  Doubtless <span class="name.char">General Howe</span>
remembered Bunker Hill, and felt that a repetition of that experience would be disastrous to
the king's cause.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Washington</span> sent over two thousand
more soldiers, from New York, which made
the force ten thousand strong within the patriot works of <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>, and he was
positive, as was <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> also, that the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span> could be held, that if the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> made
an attack it would be disastrous for them.</p>

<p>The action of <span class="name.char">General Howe</span> showed that he
thought so too, for instead of getting ready to
attack, he stretched his force around the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span>, from the East River on the north to
the East River again, on the south, in a semicircle, and it was plain that his intention was
to establish a siege.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Washington</span> realized at once that it
would not do to stay on <span class="name.place">Brooklyn Heights</span>, under such circumstances, for if the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> fleet
were to come up the East River and cut off the
patriot army's retreat in that direction, the only
result possible would be the surrender of the
Continental army on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>.  As he had no
intention of surrendering, he decided to evacuate the position, and that night all the boats that
could be gathered together were secured and the
patriot army was removed across the river to
New York.  Also all the arms, ammunitions, provisions of every kind, and the heavy artillery,
were ferried over.  Nothing was left, and when
next morning the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> looked up at the works
on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>, they were amazed to see no
signs of life there–for so silently and cautiously had the patriots worked during the night that
the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> had not gotten an inkling of the
movement.  The redcoats pushed up the hill,
and climbed over the works, only to stare
around in dismay.  Nothing was left of the
big army that had been there only the evening
before.</p>

<p>This achievement of <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>,
this wonderful feat of withdrawing an entire
army of ten thousand men, with all the arms,
including heavy artillery, and the ammunitions
and provisions from right under the very nose
of the enemy, and without the enemy even suspecting what was going on, will always be considered one of the greatest triumphs of generalship the world has ever known.  This feat,
when it became known in England, caused some
of the greatest soldiers,  and generals, and over
in Europe as well, to shake their heads and declare that <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> was a commander who would cause the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> a great deal of
trouble.  And after events proved that they
were right in their prophecies.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> must have told <span class="name.char">General
Washington</span> about <span class="name.char">Dick Dare</span> having carried a
message practically through the lines of the
<span class="name.nationality">British</span>, to <span class="name.char">General Stirling</span>, during the battle
of <span class="name.place">Long Island</span>, for the commander-in-chief,
happening to see <span class="name.char">Dick</span> the day after the army
took up quarters in New York, spoke to him
about the matter, and complimented him on
having successfully delivered the message, thus
probably saving <span class="name.char">Stirling's</span> force from capture.</p>

<p>To say that <span class="name.char">Dick</span> was well pleased at receiving words of praise from the lips of the commander-in-chief is stating it mildly.  And when
he told <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> what <span class="name.char">General Washington</span>
had said, they were well pleased also, and declared that the commander-in-chief should have
cause to be satisfied with all three of them many
times before the end of the war, and, as friends
will find, if they read the succeeding volume of
the Dare Boys Series, which will be entitled,
&#8220;The Dare Boys on The Hudson,&#8221; the brothers
kept their word, and performed many, many
wonderful deeds of daring while fighting for
Liberty.</p>

<p>The <span class="name.nationality">British</span> commander-in-chief now put
in a week trying to get the patriot commander-in-chief to agree to peace, he stating that the
king would make certain concessions, but as in
accordance with the Declaration of Independence this was not to be thought of for a moment, the interviews came to naught, and so
the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> commander-in-chief began making
preparations to continue the war.  His next
move, undoubtedly would be to capture New
York City, and <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> knew this
would be an easy matter, so he made preparations to retreat to <span class="name.city">Harlem Heights</span>, on the banks
of the Hudson at the north end of Manhattan
Island, where he would occupy a strategic position.</p>



<p>On the fifteenth of September the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
made the move that was expected.  Warships
from <span class="name.char">Admiral Howe's</span> fleet ascended the Hudson river as far as Bloomingdale, and the East
River as far as Blackwell's Island, and while
they bombarded the north end of the island,
<span class="name.char">General Howe</span> brought his army across from
Brooklyn in boats, and landed at Kipp's Bay,
near what is now the foot of 34th Street.</p>

<p><span class="name.char">General Washington</span> came down from the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span> with two brigades of patriot soldiers,
with the purpose of holding the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> in
check long enough for <span class="name.char">General Putnam</span> to evacuate the lower part of the city with the four
thousand soldiers under him at that point.  This
was accomplished, and when <span class="name.char">Putnam</span> and his
men were safe on the <span class="name.city">Heights</span>, the two brigades retired to the <span class="name.city">Heights</span> also.  The <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
then took possession of New York City, and so the two armies lay, the Continental on the
<span class="name.city">Heights</span> and the <span class="name.nationality">British</span> in the city, confronting
each other, on Manhattan Island.</p>

<p>It was an interesting situation, and especially
so to <span class="name.char">Dick</span> and <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben Foster</span>, who
were now just beginning to feel that they were
soldiers in the patriot army.</p>



<p>One evening, a few days after the <span class="name.nationality">British</span>
took possession of New York and the patriots
took up their station on <span class="name.city">Harlem Heights</span>, the
commander-in-chief of the patriot army made
the soldiers a stirring speech, as they were assembled at the center of the encampment, saying that he expected each and every soldier
to do his full duty, and support the cause of
Liberty with his life if need be.  The speech
made a great impression on <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span>,
and when they went to their quarters, they
were enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll tell you what, boys,&#8221; said <span class="name.char">Tom Dare</span>,
&#8220;it was wonderful, the way <span class="name.char">General Washington</span> talked, wasn't it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <span class="name.char">Tom</span>,&#8221; agreed <span class="name.char">Dick</span>, &#8220;and we'll come up
to his expectations, too, or know the reason
why.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in enthusiastic unison <span class="name.char">Tom</span> and <span class="name.char">Ben</span> exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!  That we will, <span class="name.char">Dick</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the time came, they kept their
word.</p>

End of Project Gutenberg's The Dare Boys of 1776, by Stephen Angus Cox

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DARE BOYS OF 1776 ***

This file should be named drbys10h.htm or drbys10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, drbys11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, drbys10ah.htm

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain

things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
