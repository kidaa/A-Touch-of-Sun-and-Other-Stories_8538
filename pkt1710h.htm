            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <font size="5">I</font>
              stood tip-toe upon a little hill,<br>
              The air was cooling, and so very still.<br>
              That the sweet buds which with a modest pride<br>
              Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,<br>
              Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,<br>
              Had not yet lost those starry diadems<br>
              Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.<br>
              The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,<br>
              And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept<br>
              On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept<br>
              A little noiseless noise among the leaves,<br>
              Born of the very sigh that silence heaves:<br>
              For not the faintest motion could be seen<br>
              Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green.<br>
              There was wide wand'ring for the greediest eye,<br>
              To peer about upon variety;<br>
              Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim,<br>
              And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;<br>
              To picture out the quaint, and curious bending<br>
              Of a fresh woodland alley, never ending;<br>
              Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,<br>
              Guess were the jaunty streams refresh themselves.<br>
              I gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free<br>
              As though the fanning wings of Mercury<br>
              Had played upon my heels: I was light-hearted,<br>
              And many pleasures to my vision started;<br>
              So I straightway began to pluck a posey<br>
              Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A bush of May flowers
              with the bees about them;<br>
              Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;<br>
              And let a lush laburnum oversweep them,<br>
              And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them<br>
              Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets,<br>
              That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A filbert hedge
              with wild briar overtwined,<br>
              And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind<br>
              Upon their summer thrones; there too should be<br>
              The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,<br>
              That with a score of light green brethen shoots &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              From the quaint mossiness of aged roots:<br>
              Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters<br>
              Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters<br>
              The spreading blue bells: it may haply mourn<br>
              That such fair clusters should be rudely torn<br>
              From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly<br>
              By infant hands, left on the path to die.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Open afresh your
              round of starry folds,<br>
              Ye ardent marigolds!<br>
              Dry up the moisture from your golden lids,<br>
              For great Apollo bids<br>
              That in these days your praises should be sung<br>
              On many harps, which he has lately strung;<br>
              And when again your dewiness he kisses,<br>
              Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses:<br>
              So haply when I rove in some far vale,<br>
              His mighty voice may come upon the gale.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here are sweet peas,
              on tip-toe for a flight:<br>
              With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white,<br>
              And taper fulgent catching at all things,<br>
              To bind them all about with tiny rings.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Linger awhile upon
              some bending planks<br>
              That lean against a streamlet's rushy banks,<br>
              And watch intently Nature's gentle doings:<br>
              They will be found softer than ring-dove's cooings.<br>
              How silent comes the water round that bend;<br>
              Not the minutest whisper does it send<br>
              To the o'erhanging sallows: blades of grass<br>
              Slowly across the chequer'd shadows pass.<br>
              Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach<br>
              To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach<br>
              A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds;<br>
              Where swarms of minnows show their little heads,<br>
              Staying their wavy bodies 'gainst the streams,<br>
              To taste the luxury of sunny beams<br>
              Temper'd with coolness. How they ever wrestle<br>
              With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle<br>
              Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand.<br>
              If you but scantily hold out the hand,<br>
              That very instant not one will remain;<br>
              But turn your eye, and they are there again.<br>
              The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,<br>
              And cool themselves among the em'rald tresses;<br>
              The while they cool themselves, they freshness give,<br>
              And moisture, that the bowery green may live:<br>
              So keeping up an interchange of favours,<br>
              Like good men in the truth of their behaviours<br>
              Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop<br>
              From low hung branches; little space they stop;<br>
              But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek;<br>
              Then off at once, as in a wanton freak:<br>
              Or perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings,<br>
              Pausing upon their yellow flutterings.<br>
              Were I in such a place, I sure should pray<br>
              That nought less sweet, might call my thoughts away,<br>
              Than the soft rustle of a maiden's gown<br>
              Fanning away the dandelion's down;<br>
              Than the light music of her nimble toes<br>
              Patting against the sorrel as she goes.<br>
              How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught<br>
              Playing in all her innocence of thought.<br>
              O let me lead her gently o'er the brook,<br>
              Watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look;<br>
              O let me for one moment touch her wrist;<br>
              Let me one moment to her breathing list;<br>
              And as she leaves me may she often turn<br>
              Her fair eyes looking through her locks aub&ugrave;rne.<br>
              What next? A tuft of evening primroses,<br>
              O'er which the mind may hover till it dozes;<br>
              O'er which it well might take a pleasant sleep,<br>
              But that 'tis ever startled by the leap<br>
              Of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting<br>
              Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;<br>
              Or by the moon lifting her silver rim<br>
              Above a cloud, and with a gradual swim<br>
              Coming into the blue with all her light.<br>
              O Maker of sweet poets, dear delight<br>
              Of this fair world, and all its gentle livers;<br>
              Spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,<br>
              Mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,<br>
              Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams,<br>
              Lover of loneliness, and wandering,<br>
              Of upcast eye, and tender pondering!<br>
              Thee must I praise above all other glories<br>
              That smile us on to tell delightful stories.<br>
              For what has made the sage or poet write<br>
              But the fair paradise of Nature's light?<br>
              In the calm grandeur of a sober line,<br>
              We see the waving of the mountain pine;<br>
              And when a tale is beautifully staid,<br>
              We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade:<br>
              When it is moving on luxurious wings,<br>
              The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings:<br>
              Fair dewy roses brush against our faces,<br>
              And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases;<br>
              O'er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar,<br>
              And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire;<br>
              While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles<br>
              Charms us at once away from all our troubles:<br>
              So that we feel uplifted from the world,<br>
              Walking upon the white clouds wreath'd and curl'd.<br>
              So felt he, who first told, how Psyche went<br>
              On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment;<br>
              What Psyche felt, and Love, when their full lips<br>
              First touch'd; what amorous, and fondling nips<br>
              They gave each other's cheeks; with all their sighs,<br>
              And how they kist each other's tremulous eyes:<br>
              The silver lamp,&#8212;the ravishment,&#8212;the wonder&#8212;<br>
              The darkness,&#8212;loneliness,&#8212;the fearful thunder;<br>
              Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,<br>
              To bow for gratitude before Jove's throne.<br>
              So did he feel, who pull'd the boughs aside,<br>
              That we might look into a forest wide,<br>
              To catch a glimpse of Fawns, and Dryades<br>
              Coming with softest rustle through the trees;<br>
              And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,<br>
              Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet:<br>
              Telling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled<br>
              Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.<br>
              Poor nymph,&#8212;poor Pan,&#8212;how he did weep to find,<br>
              Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind<br>
              Along the reedy stream; a half heard strain,<br>
              Full of sweet desolation&#8212;balmy pain.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What first inspired
              a bard of old to sing<br>
              Narcissus pining o'er the untainted spring?<br>
              In some delicious ramble, he had found<br>
              A little space, with boughs all woven round;<br>
              And in the midst of all, a clearer pool<br>
              Than e'er reflected in its pleasant cool,<br>
              The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping<br>
              Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.<br>
              And on the bank a lonely flower he spied,<br>
              A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,<br>
              Drooping its beauty o'er the watery clearness,<br>
              To woo its own sad image into nearness:<br>
              Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;<br>
              But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love.<br>
              So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot,<br>
              Some fainter gleamings o'er his fancy shot;<br>
              Nor was it long ere he had told the tale<br>
              Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo's bale.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Where had he been,
              from whose warm head out-flew<br>
              That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,<br>
              That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,<br>
              Coming ever to bless<br>
              The wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing<br>
              Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing<br>
              From out the middle air, from flowery nests,<br>
              And from the pillowy silkiness that rests<br>
              Full in the speculation of the stars.<br>
              Ah! surely he had burst our mortal bars;<br>
              Into some wond'rous region he had gone,<br>
              To search for thee, divine Endymion!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">He was a Poet, sure
              a lover too,<br>
              Who stood on Latmus' top, what time there blew<br>
              Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below;<br>
              And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow<br>
              A hymn from Dian's temple; while upswelling,<br>
              The incense went to her own starry dwelling.<br>
              But though her face was clear as infant's eyes,<br>
              Though she stood smiling o'er the sacrifice,<br>
              The Poet wept at her so piteous fate,<br>
              Wept that such beauty should be desolate:<br>
              So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,<br>
              And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Queen of the wide
              air; thou most lovely queen<br>
              Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen!<br>
              As thou exceedest all things in thy shine,<br>
              So every tale, does this sweet tale of thine.<br>
              O for three words of honey, that I might<br>
              Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Where distant ships
              do seem to show their keels,<br>
              Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels,<br>
              And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,<br>
              Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize.<br>
              The evening weather was so bright, and clear,<br>
              That men of health were of unusual cheer;<br>
              Stepping like Homer at the trumpet's call,<br>
              Or young Apollo on the pedestal:<br>
              And lovely women were as fair and warm,<br>
              As Venus looking sideways in alarm.<br>
              The breezes were ethereal, and pure,<br>
              And crept through half closed lattices to cure<br>
              The languid sick; it cool'd their fever'd sleep,<br>
              And soothed them into slumbers full and deep.<br>
              Soon they awoke clear eyed: nor burnt with thirsting,<br>
              Nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting:<br>
              And springing up, they met the wond'ring sight<br>
              Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;<br>
              Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,<br>
              And on their placid foreheads part the hair.<br>
              Young men, and maidens at each other gaz'd<br>
              With hands held back, and motionless, amaz'd<br>
              To see the brightness in each others' eyes;<br>
              And so they stood, fill'd with a sweet surprise,<br>
              Until their tongues were loos'd in poesy.<br>
              Therefore no lover did of anguish die:<br>
              But the soft numbers, in that moment spoken,<br>
              Made silken ties, that never may be broken.<br>
              Cynthia! I cannot tell the greater blisses,<br>
              That follow'd thine, and thy dear shepherd's kisses:<br>
              Was there a Poet born?&#8212;but now no more,<br>
              My wand'ring spirit must no further soar.&#8212;</font></p>

              I must tell a tale of chivalry;<br>
              For large white plumes are dancing in mine eye.<br>
              Not like the formal crest of latter days:<br>
              But bending in a thousand graceful ways;<br>
              So graceful, that it seems no mortal hand,<br>
              Or e'en the touch of Archimago's wand,<br>
              Could charm them into such an attitude.<br>
              We must think rather, that in playful mood,<br>
              Some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight,<br>
              To show this wonder of its gentle might.<br>
              Lo! I must tell a tale of chivalry;<br>
              For while I muse, the lance points slantingly<br>
              Athwart the morning air: some lady sweet,<br>
              Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet,<br>
              From the worn top of some old battlement<br>
              Hails it with tears, her stout defender sent:<br>
              And from her own pure self no joy dissembling,<br>
              Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling.<br>
              Sometimes, when the good Knight his rest would take,<br>
              It is reflected, clearly, in a lake,<br>
              With the young ashen boughs, 'gainst which it rests,<br>
              And th' half seen mossiness of linnets' nests.<br>
              Ah! shall I ever tell its cruelty,<br>
              When the fire flashes from a warrior's eye,<br>
              And his tremendous hand is grasping it,<br>
              And his dark brow for very wrath is knit?<br>
              Or when his spirit, with more calm intent,<br>
              Leaps to the honors of a tournament,<br>
              And makes the gazers round about the ring<br>
              Stare at the grandeur of the balancing? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              No, no! this is far off:&#8212;then how shall I<br>
              Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy,<br>
              Which linger yet about lone gothic arches,<br>
              In dark green ivy, and among wild larches?<br>
              How sing the splendour of the revelries,<br>
              When buts of wine are drunk off to the lees?<br>
              And that bright lance, against the fretted wall,<br>
              Beneath the shade of stately banneral,<br>
              Is slung with shining cuirass, sword, and shield?<br>
              Where ye may see a spur in bloody field.<br>
              Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces<br>
              Round the wide hall, and show their happy faces;<br>
              Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens:<br>
              Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens.<br>
              Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry:<br>
              Or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by?<br>
              Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight,<br>
              Rein in the swelling of his ample might?</font></p>

              When I think on thy noble countenance:<br>
              Where never yet was ought more earthly seen<br>
              Than the pure freshness of thy laurels green.<br>
              Therefore, great bard, I not so fearfully<br>
              Call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh<br>
              My daring steps: or if thy tender care,<br>

              That I will follow with due reverence,<br>
              And start with awe at mine own strange pretence.<br>
              Him thou wilt hear; so I will rest in hope<br>
              To see wide plains, fair trees and lawny slope:<br>
              The morn, the eve, the light, the shade, the flowers:<br>
              Clear streams, smooth lakes, and overlooking towers.</font></p>

              Calidore is paddling o'er the lake;<br>
              His healthful spirit eager and awake<br>
              To feel the beauty of a silent eve,<br>
              Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave;<br>
              The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.<br>
              He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky,<br>
              And smiles at the far clearness all around,<br>
              Until his heart is well nigh over wound,<br>
              And turns for calmness to the pleasant green<br>
              Of easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean<br>
              So elegantly o'er the waters' brim<br>
              And show their blossoms trim.<br>
              Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow<br>
              The freaks, and dartings of the black-wing'd swallow,<br>
              Delighting much, to see it half at rest,<br>
              Dip so refreshingly its wings, and breast<br>
              'Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon,<br>

              Comes up with ripple, and with easy float,<br>
              And glides into a bed of water lillies:<br>
              Broad leav'd are they and their white canopies<br>
              Are upward turn'd to catch the heavens' dew.<br>
              Near to a little island's point they grew;<br>
              Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view<br>
              Of this sweet spot of earth. The bowery shore<br>
              Went off in gentle windings to the hoar<br>
              And light blue mountains: but no breathing man<br>
              With a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan<br>
              Nature's clear beauty, could pass lightly by<br>
              Objects that look'd out so invitingly<br>
              On either side. These, gentle Calidore<br>
              Greeted, as he had known them long before.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The sidelong view

              Which the glad setting sun, in gold doth dress;<br>
              Whence ever, and anon the jay outsprings,<br>
              And scales upon the beauty of its wings.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The lonely turret,
              shatter'd, and outworn,<br>
              Stands venerably proud; too proud to mourn<br>
              Its long lost grandeur: fir trees grow around,<br>
              Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The little chapel
              with the cross above<br>
              Upholding wreaths of ivy; the white dove,<br>
              That on the windows spreads his feathers light,<br>
              And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Green tufted islands
              casting their soft shades<br>
              Across the lake; sequester'd leafy glades,<br>
              That through the dimness of their twilight show<br>
              Large dock leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow<br>
              Of the wild cat's eyes, or the silvery stems<br>
              Of delicate birch trees, or long grass which hems<br>
              A little brook. The youth had long been viewing<br>
              These pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing<br>
              The mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught<br>
              A trumpet's silver voice. Ah! it was fraught<br>
              With many joys for him: the warder's ken<br>
              Had found white coursers prancing in the glen:<br>
              Friends very dear to him he soon will see;<br>
              So pushes off his boat most eagerly,<br>
              And soon upon the lake he skims along,<br>
              Deaf to the nightingale's first under-song;<br>
              Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly:<br>
              His spirit flies before him so completely.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And now he turns
              a jutting point of land,<br>
              Whence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand:<br>
              Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches,<br>
              Before the point of his light shallop reaches<br>
              Those marble steps that through the water dip:<br>
              Now over them he goes with hasty trip,<br>
              And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors:<br>
              Anon he leaps along the oaken floors<br>
              Of halls and corridors.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Delicious sounds!
              those little bright-eyed things<br>
              That float about the air on azure wings,<br>
              Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang<br>
              Of clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang,<br>
              Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain,<br>
              Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein;<br>
              While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis<br>
              They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss,<br>
              What gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand!<br>
              How tremblingly their delicate ancles spann'd!<br>
              Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone,<br>
              While whisperings of affection<br>
              Made him delay to let their tender feet<br>
              Come to the earth; with an incline so sweet<br>
              From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent:<br>
              And whether there were tears of languishment,<br>
              Or that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses,<br>
              He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses<br>
              With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye<br>
              All the soft luxury<br>
              That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand,<br>
              Fair as some wonder out of fairy land,<br>
              Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers<br>
              Of whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers:<br>
              And this he fondled with his happy cheek<br>
              As if for joy he would no further seek;<br>
              When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond<br>
              Came to his ear, like something from beyond<br>
              His present being: so he gently drew<br>
              His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new,<br>
              From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending,<br>
              Thank'd heaven that his joy was never ending;<br>
              While 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd<br>
              A hand heaven made to succour the distress'd;<br>
              A hand that from the world's bleak promontory<br>
              Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Amid the pages,
              and the torches' glare,<br>
              There stood a knight, patting the flowing hair<br>
              Of his proud horse's mane: he was withal<br>
              A man of elegance, and stature tall:<br>
              So that the waving of his plumes would be<br>
              High as the berries of a wild ash tree,<br>
              Or as the winged cap of Mercury.<br>
              His armour was so dexterously wrought<br>
              In shape, that sure no living man had thought<br>
              It hard, and heavy steel: but that indeed<br>
              It was some glorious form, some splendid weed,<br>
              In which a spirit new come from the skies<br>
              Might live, and show itself to human eyes.<br>
              'Tis the far-fam'd, the brave Sir Gondibert,<br>
              Said the good man to Calidore alert;<br>
              While the young warrior with a step of grace<br>
              Came up,&#8212;a courtly smile upon his face,<br>
              And mailed hand held out, ready to greet<br>
              The large-eyed wonder, and ambitious heat<br>
              Of the aspiring boy; who as he led<br>
              Those smiling ladies, often turned his head<br>
              To admire the visor arched so gracefully<br>
              Over a knightly brow; while they went by<br>
              The lamps that from the high-roof'd hall were pendent,<br>
              And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Soon in a pleasant
              chamber they are seated;<br>
              The sweet-lipp'd ladies have already greeted<br>
              All the green leaves that round the window clamber,<br>
              To show their purple stars, and bells of amber.<br>
              Sir Gondibert has doff'd his shining steel,<br>
              Gladdening in the free, and airy feel<br>
              Of a light mantle; and while Clerimond<br>
              Is looking round about him with a fond,<br>
              And placid eye, young Calidore is burning<br>
              To hear of knightly deeds, and gallant spurning<br>
              Of all unworthiness; and how the strong of arm<br>
              Kept off dismay, and terror, and alarm<br>
              From lovely woman: while brimful of this,<br>
              He gave each damsel's hand so warm a kiss,<br>
              And had such manly ardour in his eye,<br>
              That each at other look'd half staringly;<br>
              And then their features started into smiles<br>
              Sweet as blue heavens o'er enchanted isles.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Softly the breezes
              from the forest came,<br>
              Softly they blew aside the taper's flame;<br>

              Morning from her orient chamber came,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;And her first footsteps touch'd a verdant hill;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Crowning its lawny crest with amber flame,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Silv'ring the untainted gushes of its rill;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Which, pure from mossy beds, did down distill,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;And after parting beds of simple flowers,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;By many streams a little lake did fill,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Which round its marge reflected woven bowers,<br>
              And, in its middle space, a sky that never lowers.</font></p>

              the king-fisher saw his plumage bright<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose silken fins, and golden scales' light<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Cast upward, through the waves, a ruby glow:<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;There saw the swan his neck of arched snow,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;And oar'd himself along with majesty;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkled his jetty eyes; his feet did show<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the waves like Afric's ebony,<br>
              And on his back a fay reclined voluptuously.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah!

              &nbsp;&nbsp;That in that fairest lake had placed been,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;I could e'en Dido of her grief beguile;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Or rob from aged Lear his bitter teen:<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;For sure so fair a place was never seen,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that ever charm'd romantic eye:<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;It seem'd an emerald in the silver sheen<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bright waters; or as when on high,<br>
              Through clouds of fleecy white, laughs the coerulean sky.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;And
              all around it dipp'd luxuriously<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Slopings of verdure through the glossy tide,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Which, as it were in gentle amity,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Rippled delighted up the flowery side;<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;As if to glean the ruddy tears, it tried,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Which fell profusely from the rose-tree stem!<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Haply it was the workings of its pride,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;In strife to throw upon the shore a gem<br>
              Outvieing all the buds in Flora's diadem.</font></p>

              Till the fond, fixed eyes, forget they stare.<br>
              From such fine pictures, heavens! I cannot dare<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;To turn my admiration, though unpossess'd<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;They be of what is worthy,&#8212;though not drest<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;These lures I straight forget,&#8212;e'en ere I dine,<br>

              My ear is open like a greedy shark,<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;God! she is like a milk-white lamb that bleats<br>
              For man's protection. Surely the All-seeing,<br>

              Of genius, to flap away each sting<br>
              Thrown by the pitiless world. We next could tell<br>
              Of those who in the cause of freedom fell:<br>
              Of our own Alfred, of Helvetian Tell;<br>
              Of him whose name to ev'ry heart's a solace,<br>
              High-minded and unbending William Wallace.<br>
              While to the rugged north our musing turns<br>

              Close to the source, bright, pure, and undefil'd,<br>
              Whence gush the streams of song: in happy hour<br>

              How, from a flower, into a fish of gold<br>
              Apollo chang'd thee; how thou next didst seem<br>
              A black-eyed swan upon the widening stream;<br>
              And when thou first didst in that mirror trace<br>
              The placid features of a human face:<br>
              That thou hast never told thy travels strange.<br>
              And all the wonders of the mazy range<br>
              O'er pebbly crystal, and o'er golden sands;<br>

              Of which, no mortal eye can reach the flowers;<br>
              And 'tis right just, for well Apollo knows<br>
              'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose.<br>
              All that's reveal'd from that far seat of blisses,<br>
              Is, the clear fountains' interchanging kisses.<br>
              As gracefully descending, light and thin,<br>
              Like silver streaks across a dolphin's fin,<br>
              When he upswimmeth from the coral caves.<br>
              And sports with half his tail above the waves.</font></p>

              With forehead to the soothing breezes bare,<br>
              Would he naught see but the dark, silent blue<br>
              With all its diamonds trembling through and through:<br>
              Or the coy moon, when in the waviness<br>
              Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress,<br>
              And staidly paces higher up, and higher,<br>
              Like a sweet nun in holy-day attire?<br>
              Ah, yes! much more would start into his sight&#8212;<br>
              The revelries, and mysteries of night:<br>
              And should I ever see them, I will tell you<br>

              What does he murmur with his latest breath,<br>
              While his proud eye looks through the film of death?<br>
              "What though I leave this dull, and earthly mould,<br>
              Yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold<br>
              With after times.&#8212;The patriot shall feel<br>

              Or, in the senate thunder out my numbers<br>
              To startle princes from their easy slumbers.<br>
              The sage will mingle with each moral theme<br>

              Lays have I left of such a dear delight<br>
              That maids will sing them on their bridal night.<br>
              Gay villagers, upon a morn of May<br>
              When they have tired their gentle limbs, with play,<br>
              And form'd a snowy circle on the grass,<br>
              And plac'd in midst of all that lovely lass<br>
              Who chosen is their queen,&#8212;with her fine head<br>
              Crowned with flowers purple, white, and red:<br>
              For there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing,<br>
              Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying:<br>
              Between her breasts, that never yet felt trouble,<br>
              A bunch of violets full blown, and double,<br>
              Serenely sleep:&#8212;she from a casket takes<br>
              A little book,&#8212;and then a joy awakes<br>
              About each youthful heart,&#8212;with stifled cries,<br>
              And rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes:<br>
              For she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears;<br>
              One that I foster'd in my youthful years:<br>
              The pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep,<br>
              Gush ever and anon with silent creep,<br>
              Lured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest<br>
              Shall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast,<br>
              Be lull'd with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu!<br>
              Thy dales, and hills, are fading from my view:<br>
              Swiftly I mount, upon wide spreading pinions,<br>
              Far from the narrow bounds of thy dominions.<br>
              Full joy I feel, while thus I cleave the air,<br>
              That my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair,<br>
              And warm thy sons!" Ah, my dear friend and brother,<br>
              Could I, at once, my mad ambition smother,<br>
              For tasting joys like these, sure I should be<br>
              Happier, and dearer to society.<br>
              At times, 'tis true, I've felt relief from pain<br>
              When some bright thought has darted through my brain:<br>
              Through all that day I've felt a greater pleasure<br>
              Than if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure.<br>
              As to my sonnets, though none else should heed them,<br>
              I feel delighted, still, that you should read them.<br>
              Of late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment,<br>
              Stretch'd on the grass at my best lov'd employment<br>
              Of scribbling lines for you. These things I thought<br>
              While, in my face, the freshest breeze I caught.<br>
              E'en now I'm pillow'd on a bed of flowers<br>
              That crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers<br>
              Above the ocean-waves. The stalks, and blades,<br>
              Chequer my tablet with their, quivering shades.<br>
              On one side is a field of drooping oats,<br>
              Through which the poppies show their scarlet coats<br>
              So pert and useless, that they bring to mind<br>
              The scarlet coats that pester human-kind.<br>
              And on the other side, outspread, is seen<br>
              Ocean's blue mantle streak'd with purple, and green.<br>
              Now 'tis I see a canvass'd ship, and now<br>
              Mark the bright silver curling round her prow.<br>
              I see the lark down-dropping to his nest.<br>
              And the broad winged sea-gull never at rest;<br>
              For when no more he spreads his feathers free,<br>
              His breast is dancing on the restless sea.<br>
              Now I direct my eyes into the west,<br>
              Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest:<br>
              Why westward turn? 'Twas but to say adieu!<br>
              'Twas but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you!</font></p>

              And with proud breast his own white shadow crowning;<br>
              He slants his neck beneath the waters bright<br>
              So silently, it seems a beam of light<br>
              Come from the galaxy: anon he sports,&#8212;<br>
              With outspread wings the Naiad Zephyr courts,<br>
              Or ruffles all the surface of the lake<br>
              In striving from its crystal face to take<br>
              Some diamond water drops, and them to treasure<br>
              In milky nest, and sip them off at leisure.<br>

              And drop like hours into eternity.<br>
              Just like that bird am I in loss of time,<br>
              Whene'er I venture on the stream of rhyme;<br>
              With shatter'd boat, oar snapt, and canvass rent,<br>
              I slowly sail, scarce knowing my intent;<br>
              Still scooping up the water with my fingers,<br>

            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By this, friend
              Charles, you may full plainly see<br>
              Why I have never penn'd a line to thee:<br>
              Because my thoughts were never free, and clear,<br>
              And little fit to please a classic ear;<br>
              Because my wine was of too poor a savour<br>
              For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour<br>
              Of sparkling Helicon:&#8212;small good it were<br>
              To take him to a desert rude, and bare.<br>
              Who had on Baiae's shore reclin'd at ease,<br>
              While Tasso's page was floating in a breeze<br>
              That gave soft music from Armida's bowers,<br>
              Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers:<br>
              Small good to one who had by Mulla's stream<br>
              Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream;<br>
              Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook,<br>
              And lovely Una in a leafy nook,<br>
              And Archimago leaning o'er his book:<br>
              Who had of all that's sweet tasted, and seen,<br>
              From silv'ry ripple, up to beauty's queen;<br>
              From the sequester'd haunts of gay Titania,<br>
              To the blue dwelling of divine Urania:<br>
              One, who, of late, had ta'en sweet forest walks<br>
              With him who elegantly chats, and talks&#8212;<br>
              The wrong'd Libert as,&#8212;who has told you stories<br>
              Of laurel chaplets, and Apollo's glories;<br>
              Of troops chivalrous prancing; through a city,<br>
              And tearful ladies made for love, and pity:<br>
              With many else which I have never known.<br>
              Thus have I thought; and days on days have flown<br>
              Slowly, or rapidly&#8212;unwilling still<br>
              For you to try my dull, unlearned quill.<br>
              Nor should I now, but that I've known you long;<br>
              That you first taught me all the sweets of song:<br>
              The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, the fine;<br>
              What swell'd with pathos, and what right divine:<br>
              Spenserian vowels that elope with ease,<br>
              And float along like birds o'er summer seas;<br>
              Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness;<br>
              Michael in arms, and more, meek Eve's fair slenderness.<br>
              Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly<br>
              Up to its climax and then dying proudly?<br>
              Who found for me the grandeur of the ode,<br>
              Growing, like Atlas, stronger from its load?<br>
              Who let me taste that more than cordial dram,<br>
              The sharp, the rapier-pointed epigram?<br>
              Shew'd me that epic was of all the king,<br>
              Round, vast, and spanning all like Saturn's ring?<br>
              You too upheld the veil from Clio's beauty,<br>
              And pointed out the patriot's stern duty;<br>
              The might of Alfred, and the shaft of Tell;<br>
              The hand of Brutus, that so grandly fell<br>
              Upon a tyrant's head. Ah! had I never seen,<br>
              Or known your kindness, what might I have been?<br>
              What my enjoyments in my youthful years,<br>
              Bereft of all that now my life endears?<br>
              And can I e'er these benefits forget?<br>
              And can I e'er repay the friendly debt?<br>
              No, doubly no;&#8212;yet should these rhymings please,<br>
              I shall roll on the grass with two-fold ease:<br>
              For I have long time been my fancy feeding<br>
              With hopes that you would one day think the reading<br>
              Of my rough verses not an hour misspent;<br>
              Should it e'er be so, what a rich content!<br>
              Some weeks have pass'd since last I saw the spires<br>
              In lucent Thames reflected:&#8212;warm desires<br>
              To see the sun o'er peep the eastern dimness,<br>
              And morning shadows streaking into slimness<br>
              Across the lawny fields, and pebbly water;<br>
              To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter;<br>
              To feel the air that plays about the hills,<br>
              And sips its freshness from the little rills;<br>
              To see high, golden corn wave in the light<br>
              When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night,<br>
              And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white,<br>
              As though she were reclining in a bed<br>
              Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed.<br>
              No sooner had I stepp'd into these pleasures<br>
              Than I began to think of rhymes and measures:<br>
              The air that floated by me seem'd to say<br>
              "Write! thou wilt never have a better day."<br>
              And so I did. When many lines I'd written,<br>
              Though with their grace I was not oversmitten,<br>
              Yet, as my hand was warm, I thought I'd better<br>
              Trust to my feelings, and write you a letter.<br>
              Such an attempt required an inspiration<br>
              Of a peculiar sort,&#8212;a consummation;&#8212;<br>
              Which, had I felt, these scribblings might have been<br>
              Verses from which the soul would never wean:<br>
              But many days have past since last my heart<br>
              Was warm'd luxuriously by divine Mozart;<br>
              By Arne delighted, or by Handel madden'd;<br>
              Or by the song of Erin pierc'd and sadden'd:<br>
              What time you were before the music sitting,<br>
              And the rich notes to each sensation fitting.<br>
              Since I have walk'd with you through shady lanes<br>
              That freshly terminate in open plains,<br>
              And revel'd in a chat that ceased not<br>
              When at night-fall among your books we got:<br>
              No, nor when supper came, nor after that,&#8212;<br>
              Nor when reluctantly I took my hat;<br>
              No, nor till cordially you shook my hand<br>
              Mid-way between our homes:&#8212;your accents bland<br>
              Still sounded in my ears, when I no more<br>
              Could hear your footsteps touch the grav'ly floor.<br>
              Sometimes I lost them, and then found again;<br>
              You chang'd the footpath for the grassy plain.<br>
              In those still moments I have wish'd you joys<br>
              That well you know to honour:&#8212;"Life's very toys<br>
              With him," said I, "will take a pleasant charm;<br>
              It cannot be that ought will work him harm."<br>
              These thoughts now come o'er me with all their might:&#8212;<br>
              Again I shake your hand,&#8212;friend Charles, good night.</font></p>

              It came. Also imaginings will hover<br>
              Round my fire-side, and haply there discover<br>
              Vistas of solemn beauty, where I'd wander<br>
              In happy silence, like the clear meander<br>

              Along a huge cloud's ridge; and now with sprightly<br>
              Wheel downward come they into fresher skies,<br>
              Tipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes.<br>
              Still downward with capacious whirl they glide,<br>
              And now I see them on a green-hill's side<br>
              In breezy rest among the nodding stalks.<br>
              The charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks<br>
              To the trees and mountains; and there soon appear<br>
              Shapes of delight, of mystery, and fear,<br>
              Passing along before a dusky space<br>
              Made by some mighty oaks: as they would chase<br>
              Some ever-fleeting music on they sweep.<br>
              Lo! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep:<br>
              Some with upholden hand and mouth severe;<br>
              Some with their faces muffled to the ear<br>
              Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,<br>
              Go glad and smilingly, athwart the gloom;<br>
              Some looking back, and some with upward gaze;<br>
              Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways<br>
              Flit onward&#8212;now a lovely wreath of girls<br>
              Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;<br>
              And now broad wings. Most awfully intent<br>
              The driver, of those steeds is forward bent,<br>
              And seems to listen: O that I might know<br>
              All that he writes with such a hurrying glow.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The visions all

              Into the light of heaven, and in their stead<br>
              A sense of real things comes doubly strong,<br>
              And, like a muddy stream, would bear along<br>
              My soul to nothingness: but I will strive<br>
              Against all doublings, and will keep alive<br>
              The thought of that same chariot, and the strange<br>
              Journey it went.</font></p>

              Imagination cannot freely fly<br>
              As she was wont of old? prepare her steeds,<br>
              Paw up against the light, and do strange deeds<br>
              Upon the clouds? Has she not shewn us all?<br>
              From the clear space of ether, to the small<br>
              Breath of new buds unfolding? From the meaning<br>
              Of Jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening<br>
              Of April meadows? Here her altar shone,<br>
              E'en in this isle; and who could paragon<br>
              The fervid choir that lifted up a noise<br>
              Of harmony, to where it aye will poise<br>
              Its mighty self of convoluting sound,<br>
              Huge as a planet, and like that roll round,<br>
              Eternally around a dizzy void?<br>
              Ay, in those days the Muses were nigh cloy'd<br>
              With honors; nor had any other care<br>
              Than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Could all this be
              forgotten? Yes, a schism<br>
              Nurtured by foppery and barbarism,<br>
              Made great Apollo blush for this his land.<br>
              Men were thought wise who could not understand<br>
              His glories: with a puling infant's force<br>
              They sway'd about upon a rocking horse,<br>
              And thought it Pegasus. Ah dismal soul'd!<br>
              The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd<br>
              Its gathering waves&#8212;ye felt it not. The blue<br>
              Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew<br>
              Of summer nights collected still to make<br>
              The morning precious: beauty was awake!<br>
              Why were ye not awake? But ye were dead<br>
              To things ye knew not of,&#8212;were closely wed<br>
              To musty laws lined out with wretched rule<br>
              And compass vile: so that ye taught a school<br>
              Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,<br>
              Till, like the certain wands of Jacob's wit,<br>
              Their verses tallied. Easy was the task:<br>
              A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask<br>
              Of Poesy. Ill-fated, impious race!<br>
              That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face,<br>
              And did not know it,&#8212;no, they went about,<br>
              Holding a poor, decrepid standard out<br>
              Mark'd with most flimsy mottos, and in large<br>
              The name of one Boileau!</font></p>

              Whose congregated majesty so fills<br>
              My boundly reverence, that I cannot trace<br>
              Your hallowed names, in this unholy place,<br>
              So near those common folk; did not their shames<br>
              Affright you? Did our old lamenting Thames<br>
              Delight you? Did ye never cluster round<br>
              Delicious Avon, with a mournful sound,<br>
              And weep? Or did ye wholly bid adieu<br>
              To regions where no more the laurel grew?<br>
              Or did ye stay to give a welcoming<br>
              To some lone spirits who could proudly sing<br>
              Their youth away, and die? 'Twas even so:<br>
              But let me think away those times of woe:<br>
              Now 'tis a fairer season; ye have breathed<br>
              Rich benedictions o'er us; ye have wreathed<br>
              Fresh garlands: for sweet music has been heard<br>
              In many places;&#8212;some has been upstirr'd<br>
              From out its crystal dwelling in a lake,<br>
              By a swan's ebon bill; from a thick brake,<br>
              Nested and quiet in a valley mild,<br>
              Bubbles a pipe; fine sounds are floating wild<br>
              About the earth: happy are ye and glad.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">These things are
              doubtless: yet in truth we've had<br>
              Strange thunders from the potency of song;<br>
              Mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong,<br>
              From majesty: but in clear truth the themes<br>
              Are ugly clubs, the Poets Polyphemes<br>
              Disturbing the grand sea. A drainless shower<br>
              Of light is poesy; 'tis the supreme of power;<br>

              And still she governs with the mildest sway:<br>
              But strength alone though of the Muses born<br>
              Is like a fallen angel: trees uptorn,<br>
              Darkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres<br>
              Delight it; for it feeds upon the burrs,<br>
              And thorns of life; forgetting the great end<br>
              Of poesy, that it should be a friend<br>
              To sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man.</font></p>

              A silent space with ever sprouting green.<br>
              All tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen,<br>
              Creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering,<br>

              Then let us clear away the choaking thorns<br>
              From round its gentle stem; let the young fawns,<br>
              Yeaned in after times, when we are flown,<br>
              Find a fresh sward beneath it, overgrown<br>
              With simple flowers: let there nothing be<br>
              More boisterous than a lover's bended knee;<br>
              Nought more ungentle than the placid look<br>
              Of one who leans upon a closed book;<br>
              Nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes<br>
              Between two hills. All hail delightful hopes!<br>
              As she was wont, th' imagination<br>
              Into most lovely labyrinths will be gone,<br>
              And they shall be accounted poet kings<br>
              Who simply tell the most heart-easing things.<br>

              A noble end, are thirsty every hour.<br>
              What though I am not wealthy in the dower<br>
              Of spanning wisdom; though I do not know<br>
              The shiftings of the mighty winds, that blow<br>
              Hither and thither all the changing thoughts<br>
              Of man: though no great minist'ring reason sorts<br>
              Out the dark mysteries of human souls<br>
              To clear conceiving: yet there ever rolls<br>
              A vast idea before me, and I glean<br>
              Therefrom my liberty; thence too I've seen<br>
              The end and aim of Poesy. 'Tis clear<br>
              As any thing most true; as that the year<br>
              Is made of the four seasons&#8212;manifest<br>
              As a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,<br>
              Lifted to the white clouds. Therefore should I<br>
              Be but the essence of deformity,<br>
              A coward, did my very eye-lids wink<br>
              At speaking out what I have dared to think.<br>
              Ah! rather let me like a madman run<br>
              Over some precipice; let the hot sun<br>
              Melt my Dedalian wings, and drive me down<br>
              Convuls'd and headlong! Stay! an inward frown<br>
              Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile.<br>
              An ocean dim, sprinkled with many an isle,<br>
              Spreads awfully before me. How much toil!<br>
              How many days! what desperate turmoil!<br>
              Ere I can have explored its widenesses.<br>
              Ah, what a task! upon my bended knees,<br>

              E'en now all tumult from my bosom fades:<br>
              I turn full hearted to the friendly aids<br>
              That smooth the path of honour; brotherhood,<br>
              And friendliness the nurse of mutual good.<br>
              The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet<br>
              Into the brain ere one can think upon it;<br>
              The silence when some rhymes are coming out;<br>
              And when they're come, the very pleasant rout:<br>
              The message certain to be done to-morrow.<br>
              'Tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow<br>
              Some precious book from out its snug retreat,<br>

              Scarce can I scribble on; for lovely airs<br>
              Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs;<br>
              Many delights of that glad day recalling,<br>
              When first my senses caught their tender falling.<br>
              And with these airs come forms of elegance<br>
              Stooping their shoulders o'er a horse's prance,<br>
              Careless, and grand&#8212;fingers soft and round<br>
              Parting luxuriant curls;&#8212;and the swift bound<br>
              Of Bacchus from his chariot, when his eye<br>
              Made Ariadne's cheek look blushingly.<br>

              Of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes:<br>
              A linnet starting all about the bushes:<br>
              A butterfly, with golden wings broad parted,<br>
              Nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted<br>
              With over pleasure&#8212;many, many more,<br>

              For what there may be worthy in these rhymes<br>
              I partly owe to him: and thus, the chimes<br>
              Of friendly voices had just given place<br>
              To as sweet a silence, when I 'gan retrace<br>
              The pleasant day, upon a couch at ease.<br>
              It was a poet's house who keeps the keys<br>
              Of pleasure's temple. Round about were hung<br>
              The glorious features of the bards who sung<br>
              In other ages&#8212;cold and sacred busts<br>
              Smiled at each other. Happy he who trusts<br>
              To clear Futurity his darling fame!<br>
              Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim<br>
              At swelling apples with a frisky leap<br>
              And reaching fingers, 'mid a luscious heap<br>
              Of vine leaves. Then there rose to view a fane<br>
              Of liny marble, and thereto a train<br>
              Of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward:<br>
              One, loveliest, holding her white band toward<br>
              The dazzling sun-rise: two sisters sweet<br>
              Bending their graceful figures till they meet<br>
              Over the trippings of a little child:<br>
              And some are hearing, eagerly, the wild<br>
              Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping.<br>
              See, in another picture, nymphs are wiping<br>
              Cherishingly Diana's timorous limbs;&#8212;<br>
              A fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims<br>
              At the bath's edge, and keeps a gentle motion<br>
              With the subsiding crystal: as when ocean<br>
              Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothiness o'er<br>
              Its rocky marge, and balances once more<br>
              The patient weeds; that now unshent by foam<br>
              Feel all about their undulating home.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Sappho's meek head
              was there half smiling down<br>
              At nothing; just as though the earnest frown<br>
              Of over thinking had that moment gone<br>
              From off her brow, and left her all alone.</font></p>

              For over them was seen a free display<br>
              Of out-spread wings, and from between them shone<br>
              The face of Poesy: from off her throne<br>
              She overlook'd things that I scarce could tell.<br>
              The very sense of where I was might well<br>
              Keep Sleep aloof: but more than that there came<br>
              Thought after thought to nourish up the flame<br>
              Within my breast; so that the morning light<br>
              Surprised me even from a sleepless night;<br>
              And up I rose refresh'd, and glad, and gay,<br>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, POEMS 1817 ***

This file should be named pkt1710h.htm or pkt1710h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, pkt1711h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, pkt1710ah.htm


Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or
<a href="http://promo.net.pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05</a> or
<a href="ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04">ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05</a>

Or /etext05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is

          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
