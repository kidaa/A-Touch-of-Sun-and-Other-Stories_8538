\par 
\par We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
\par of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
\par Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
\par even years after the official publication date.
\par 
\par Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
\par midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
\par The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
\par Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
\par preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
\par and editing by those who wish to do so.
\par 
\par Most people start at our sites at:
\par http://gutenberg.net or
\par http://promo.net/pg
\par 
\par These Web sites include award\_winning information about Project
\par Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
\par eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).
\par 
\par Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
\par can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
\par also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
\par indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
\par announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.
\par 
\par http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05 or
\par ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05

\par 
\par Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
\par as it appears in our Newsletters.

\par 
\par Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
\par 
\par We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
\par time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
\par to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
\par searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
\par projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
\par per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
\par million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new eBook
\par files per month, or 500 more eBooks in 2000 for a total of 4000+
\par If they reach just 1\_2% of the world's population then the total
\par should reach over 300 billion eBooks given away by year's end.
\par 
\par The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion eBook
\par Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
\par This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
\par which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
\par 
\par At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one\_third
\par of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 eBooks.  We need
\par funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
\par or increase our production and reach our goals.
\par 
\par The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
\par to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.
\par 
\par As of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people
\par and organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,
\par Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,
\par Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,
\par Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
\par Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
\par Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South
\par Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
\par Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
\par 
\par We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
\par that have responded.
\par 
\par As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
\par will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
\par Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.
\par 
\par In answer to various questions we have received on this:
\par 
\par We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
\par request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
\par you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
\par just ask.
\par 
\par While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
\par not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
\par donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
\par donate.
\par 
\par International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
\par how to make them tax\_deductible, or even if they CAN be made
\par deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
\par ways.
\par 
\par Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

\par Contact us if you want to arrange for a wire transfer or payment
\par method other than by check or money order.
\par 
\par The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been approved by
\par the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN
\par [Employee Identification Number] 64\_622154.  Donations are
\par tax\_deductible to the maximum extent permitted by law.  As fund\_raising
\par requirements for other states are met, additions to this list will be

 the general treasury for it, each year the General Assembly votes for a voluntary donation to the private school, on behalf of the taxpayers of Delaware, out of the treasury.

Although there is a big Air Force base in Dover, the federal government is a relatively minor economic force, so federal pork barrels don't influence Delaware politics much.  State and local governments don't employ a lot of people, and many government em
p
loyees, even some of the highest elected officials, are allowed to have private employment at the same time, so political pigs have access to slop from other sources, not just the public trough.  The office of Attorney General, for example, is established
 
in the state constitution; the AG heads the Department of Justice, is elected in a statewide election every four years, and stands third in line to become governor if something happens to the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the secretary of state. 
 
The AG can invalidate state statutes simply by issuing a written opinion, and no criminal complaint can even be filed, much less prosecuted, without the AG's approval; in short, as Delaware's lawyer, the AG has complete control over all legal processes th
at involve the state government.

Incumbent AG Charles M. Oberly III, first elected in 1982, shortly started publishing a newsletter as a private business.  Questions were raised as to whether that was ethical or even lawful, but Oberly exercised hi

ly doesn't have the same production costs as his competitors, and some of his subscribers have told me they see it as legal insurance -\~

 it gives a false impression:  Many of the lawyers in Delaware are employed in companies other than law firms, so they're not available for hire by other clients; many of the lawyers working in banks or other companies are not admitted to the Delaware bar
,
 so they couldn't go into private practice anyhow.  Unlike many states, Delaware no longer cuts lawyers from other states any slack in getting into the Delaware bar, and every candidate for admission has to take the same bar exam and perform the same cler
k
ship, no matter how long the person may have been a lawyer (or even a judge) elsewhere.  This anti-carpetbagger rule was made by the all-lawyer state Supreme Court, not the nearly lawyer-free legislature (now 1 of 21 senators; 1 of 41 representatives), an
d ensures that there won't be too many lawyers (about 1900 now) compared to the amount of business, but it has the effect of decreasing competition, and I firmly believe that free-market competition is always good and is what made this country great.

 a contingency fee (often a third of the amount recovered), meaning they get paid only if they win, and the plaintiff doesn't pay any up-front legal fees.  That's why there's too much litigation in this country:  No matter how bogus the suits are, a lawye

 who files enough of them will sometimes hit the jackpot; defendants often settle for nuisance value to avoid the humongous legal expenses they will incur even if they end up winning, and it doesn't cost plaintiffs anything to sue, so if they lose they're
 not out anything, and if they win they come out ahead.

In Delaware it's not like that.  The big-ticket legal cases here are not over personal injuries but over corporation law, and we have a special court for litigating corporation cases, the Chan
cery Court.  Chancery or equity court started in England in the late 1300s and over the centuries developed a separate structure similar to that of the so-called law courts, and certain types of cases became associated with one or the other.  By the time 
A
merica was settled, it was established that criminal prosecutions and civil suits for money damages were legal cases, while probate, adoptions, and civil suits for injunctions were equity cases.  One of the main distinctions between them was that there we
re no juries in chancery.

A trustee is a person who has agreed to hold or manage property for someone else's benefit, and anything to do with trusts is within the equity court's jurisdiction.  The idea of a corporation is that its directors are tru
stees for its stockholders, managing the money they paid for their shares for their benefit, so any litigation over corporate affairs is a chancery case.

 enjoin the deal.  There are three points a party has to prove to get a preliminary injunction, so the Chancery Court should have a one-page preliminary injunction opinion form that has, for each of those three questions, a "no" box and a "yes" box with a
 blank next to it for the judge to fill in the fact that proved that point.  Then the word processor could spit out the standardized preliminary injunction opinion with those customizations -\~

process and so cut down on the profits from it.  Most lawyers in Wilmington (which is the bulk of the lawyers in Delaware, using that word in several different senses) are or want to be local counsel for out-of-state lawyers in corporation cases; the ethi
c

governor are elected separately, so we can, and recently did, have a governor who was a Republican and a lieutenant who was a Democrat.  The governor appoints the Secretary of State, who regulates corporations -\~

campaigns but can't vote and usually aren't in Delaware anyhow.  If something happens to incapacitate the governor and lieutenant governor, the Secretary of State becomes governor; if something happens to him, the AG elected by the people becomes governor

 some for petty campaign financing violations and others for drunk driving.  When Oberly was himself arrested for drunk driving, however, he had the charges dropped, and when his chief deputy Silverman was charged with hit-and-run, they'd had those charge

At the interview, Butler outlined the Trust Company's history:  After some months of handling only pension trusts, the Trust Company wanted to get into personal trusts, so it had hired Butler away from
 one of the local banks to head the personal trust department; he'd come on board the beginning of 1984 and had been trying to hire two people to work for him: one to stay inside and mostly draft documents, which is what they were considering me for, and 
o
ne to travel around the country teaching Hutton's brokerage house employees about trusts.  In a year or so they might add an office on the West Coast, and in about three years Butler would be retiring; I figured that would give me time to learn what I nee
d

What happens in many companies is that a few, usually senior management, employees are the trustees for the fund, so they make the investment decisions, and the fund has a broker who buys and sells as directed by the trustees.  That
's the theory, at least, but what often happens is the committee of trustees don't know enough, or have enough time outside of their work, to make investment decisions, so they take the broker's advice, and that's not necessarily bad.  But to keep the bro
kers honest, trustees with good sense often deal with several brokers and play them off against each other, and that's free-market competition and good for everyone except the greedier brokers.

would cut holes, a tad bigger than a grown monkey's paw, in coconuts, empty them out, put some dried rice inside, and chain them to a tree trunk; at night the monkeys would come, reach inside for the rice, not be able to get their fists out, and be sittin

So someone came up with the brilliant idea to set up a separate Hutton entity to be trustee of the pension funds, and collect fees for that, and put all the brokerage through Hutton & Co.  That entity would be E.\~F. Hu

l
ooked at Delaware, which was offering some tax and legal incentives to lure companies to Wilmington; you may remember that some credit card companies moved their headquarters to Delaware then to take advantage of those incentives and Delaware's statutes a

Layton & Finger and maybe Prickett, Jones, Elliott, Kristol & Schnee) were unsuccessful: some because they filed the application, but it was denied, and some because the other banks they represented objected, so they withdrew from filing Hutton's applicat

Under the governing laws, regulations, and guidelines, as a trustee the Trust Company had to make both investment decisions and pay-out decisions in the best interests of the trust's beneficiaries, but Hutton never intended for the 
Trust Company to make those decisions, so no mechanisms were ever set up for them.  Instead, once an account executive from the brokerage firm would sign a trust client up with the Trust Company, the Trust Company would make whatever investments and distr

The important point is that there never were any assets at the Trust Company.  All the assets were in the brokerage accounts at Hutton & Co., and all the Trust Company ever had was the phantom SEI accounts supposedly reflecting whate

The monthly statements from SEI were printed in bulk by SEI and delivered to us in boxes, and Hutton & Co. sent us copies of the monthly brokerage statement in each account that was coded as a trust accou

hey knew whatever the brokerage statement said was what had actually happened in the account.  But they changed only the paper statements and never put the changes in the computer!

There was also the problem, actually several problems, that the Trust Company wasn't keeping any tax records.  For one thing, even though the pension trusts were exempt from paying income tax, they still had to file information returns about 
their transactions each year, and you have to keep track of the tax basis of a pension trust's assets, because at some point you end up distributing those assets, and you have to know what they're worth for tax purposes then.  But the Trust Company wasn't
 keeping those records, and the customers kept complaining they couldn't get the information for their annual Forms 5500.

{\pntxtb 3:\'b6}}\faauto\ls4\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\f1\cgrid0 A second aspect of the problem was that Hutton Trust had about a dozen "collective funds" that were like mutual funds in that 
the assets from a lot of separate pension plans would be pooled and invested, and the profits would be prorated among the participating plans.  Those were perfectly legal entities, authorized by the Internal Revenue Code and called "pooled income funds," 
a
nd they're tax-exempt, but they have to file information tax returns every year so the IRS can make sure they're complying with all the applicable ERISA and tax laws.  But Hutton had never filed any tax returns for any of its collective funds because neit
her Hitchcock nor anyone else at Hutton knew they were supposed to.

profits.  So just as any individual or corporate taxpayer has to, a non-ERISA trust has to keep track of its tax basis for assets and report not only its income from its investments but also its capital gain on the sale of those assets.  And Hitchcock had
n't activated the fields to keep track of the tax basis and fair market value of trust assets, because that information didn't appear in the brokerage firm's computer.

 their brokerage commissions.  By the time I found out about the trusts, the AE had already sold the stock, and when I told him annuities were an improper investment for the Burchards, he told me not to worry -\~
- the insurance company wouldn't issue annuiti

a
n archetypical example of "churning" an account, which means repeatedly liquidating investments and reinvesting the assets to collect commissions on the new investments.  I got into trouble with Abbes for it, but I went over the AE's head to his branch of
f
ice manager, and the BOM did keep the AE from tying the assets up in insurance.  For some reason, every few months the two Burchard trusts would pop up as exceptions in another internal audit, and I'd get a phone call from some Hutton employee somewhere i
n
 the country, and I'd explain what happened, and that person wouldn't bother me about it again.  Then one day I got a phone call from a bank officer at the Illinois bank whose stock they'd owned; when the bank had gone to hold its annual stockholders' mee

threatened to sue on behalf of the Burchards.  I don't know how that situation finally came out, but I've often wondered.

Besides the comic relief, Hutton also provided some romantic interest:  One of the CSD units was Hutton Portfolio Management, and it was headed by Greg Phipps, whom I found very attractive, but wh
en I not too subtly let him know I was interested, he rather more subtly let me know he wasn't, so I didn't embarrass either one of us by pushing it.  For the most part, Hutton employees didn't have much class -\~
- which isn't to say they weren't great to work with and fun to party with, because they were, and the people were part of what I really loved about working there -\~
- but Phipps used an Imari cup for his tea, even when he was alone in his office, you know what I mean?  Once when we went to Hutton he
adquarters in New York to meet with some customers about bringing a big trust in, he took me on a walking tour around Wall Street, including Trinity Church and the Stock Exchange, and told me their history.

account's value instead of commissions on each transaction.  Phipps handpicked the AEs who got into the program and supervised their training and their performance, and it was a class act all the way.

The last week of October 1984 I had to go to Basel, Switzerland, on rather short notice to meet with Owen, Hausman, Walker, Ward, Craig, and someone from the Swiss bank, and that's when I finally saw the printout of how the
 transaction was supposed to work.  There were two kinds of problems with it:  One was that the bank wanted Hutton to sign as the one liable for paying the interest for the term of the loan and paying back the principal in Swiss francs at the end, so we w
o
uld in effect be guaranteeing not only the interest rate on Treasuries but also the exchange rate, and we wouldn't; the other was that there were so many finders' fees and up-front points to be paid to the various players that it would take every bit of i
n
come from the Treasuries, compounded by being repeatedly reinvested over the term of the loan, to get the principal back to the amount to be repaid, and that didn't leave anything to pay the income taxes with.  When I pointed that out, Owen said, "But we 
don't want to pay any income taxes," and I said, "Nobody wants to pay income taxes, but how do you expect to get out of it?"  So they put me on the telephone to Mills -\~
- whom they always referred to as "the Chairman" with such reverence that Abbes tried teasing them once by referring to Fomon the same way, but they were not amused -\~
- back in the States to find out what the story was on taxes.  That was the only time I ever talked to him, and he didn't have any idea how to get out of the taxes, either, but he said he'd get the guys there working on it.

my own turf and into exotic surroundings IDP might get me to agree to something, to Hutton's detriment, that I wouldn't agree to at home; Abbes said, "If you think that, you don't know Kay very well!"  Abbes knew, from trying to himself, it's virtually im
