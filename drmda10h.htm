      STRIKE HANDS, YOUNG MEN!
    </h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Strike hands, young men!<br>
      We know not when<br>
      Death or disaster comes,<br>
      Mightier than battle-drums<br>
      To summon us away.<br>
      Death bids us say farewell<br>
      To all we love, nor stay<br>
      For tears;&#8212;and who can tell<br>
      How soon misfortune's hand<br>
      May smite us where we stand,<br>
      Dragging us down, aloof,<br>
      Under the swift world's hoof?
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Strike hands for faith, and power<br>
      To gladden the passing hour;<br>
      To wield the sword, or raise a song;&#8212;<br>
      To press the grape; or crush out wrong.<br>
      And strengthen right.<br>
      Give me the man of sturdy palm<br>
      And vigorous brain;<br>
      Hearty, companionable, sane,<br>
      'Mid all commotions calm,<br>
      Yet filled with quick, enthusiastic fire;&#8212;<br>
      Give me the man<br>
      Whose impulses aspire,<br>
      And all his features seem to say, "I can!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Strike hands, young men!<br>
      'Tis yours to help rebuild the State,<br>
      And keep the Nation great.<br>
      With act and speech and pen<br>
      'Tis yours to spread<br>
      The morning-red<br>
      That ushers in a grander day:<br>
      To scatter prejudice that blinds,<br>
      And hail fresh thoughts in noble minds;<br>
      To overthrow bland tyrannies<br>
      That cheat the people, and with slow disease<br>
      Change the Republic to a mockery.<br>
      Your words can teach that liberty<br>
      Means more than just to cry "We're free"<br>
      While bending to some new-found yoke.<br>
      So shall each unjust bond be broke,<br>
      Each toiler gain his meet reward,<br>
      And life sound forth a truer chord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, if we so have striven,<br>
      And mutually the grasp have given<br>
      Of brotherhood,<br>
      To work each other and the whole race good;<br>
      What matter if the dream<br>
      Come only partly true,<br>
      And all the things accomplished seem<br>
      Feeble and few?<br>
      At least, when summer's flame burns low<br>
      And on our heads the drifting snow<br>
      Settles and stays,<br>
      We shall rejoice that in our earlier days<br>
      We boldly then<br>
      Struck hands, young men!

    <h3>
      "O JAY!"
    </h3>
    <p>
      O jay&#8212;<br>
      Blue-jay!<br>
      What are you trying to say?<br>
      I remember, in the spring<br>
      You pretended you could sing;<br>
      But your voice is now still queerer,<br>
      And as yet you've come no nearer<br>
      To a song.<br>
      In fact, to sum the matter,<br>
      I never heard a flatter<br>
      Failure than your doleful clatter.<br>
      Don't you think it's wrong?<br>
      It was sweet to hear your note,<br>
      I'll not deny,<br>
      When April set pale clouds afloat<br>
      O'er the blue tides of sky,<br>
      And 'mid the wind's triumphant drums<br>
      You, in your white and azure coat,<br>
      A herald proud, came forth to cry,<br>
      "The royal summer comes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; But now that autumn's here,<br>
      And the leaves curl up in sheer<br>
      Disgust,<br>
      And the cold rains fringe the pine,<br>
      You really must<br>
      Stop that supercilious whine&#8212;-<br>
      Or you'll be shot, by some mephitic<br>
      Angry critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; You don't fulfill your early promise:<br>
      You're not the smartest<br>
      Kind of artist,<br>
      Any more than poor Blind Tom is.<br>
      Yet somehow, still,<br>
      There's meaning in your screaming bill.<br>
      What <i>are</i> you trying to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes your piping is delicious,<br>
      And then again it's simply vicious;<br>
      Though on the whole the varying jangle<br>
      Weaves round me an entrancing tangle<br>
      Of memories grave or joyous:<br>
      Things to weep or laugh at;<br>
      Love that lived at a hint, or<br>
      Days so sweet, they'd cloy us;<br>
      Nights I have spent with friends;&#8212;<br>
      Glistening groves of winter,<br>
      And the sound of vanished feet<br>
      That walked by the ripening wheat;<br>
      With other things.... Not the half that<br>
      Your cry familiar blends<br>
      Can I name, for it is mostly<br>
      Very ghostly;&#8212;<br>
      Such mixed-up things your voice recalls,<br>
      With its peculiar quirks and falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Possibly, then, your meaning, plain,<br>
      Is that your harsh and broken strain<br>
      Tallies best with a world of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'll admit<br>
      There's merit in a voice that's truthful:<br>
      Yours is not honey-sweet nor youthful,<br>
      But querulously fit.<br>
      And if we cannot sing, we'll say<br>
      Something to the purpose, jay!

      THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Go," said the star to its light:<br>
      "Follow your fathomless flight!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Into the dreams of space<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Carry the joy of my face.<br>
      Go," said the star to its light:<br>
      "Tell me the tale of your flight."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the mandate rang<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The heavens through,<br>
      Quick the ray sprang:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Unheard it flew,<br>
      Sped by the touch of an unseen spur.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; It crumbled the dusk of the deep<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; That folds the worlds in sleep,<br>
      And shot through night with noiseless stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the day;<br>
      And all that swift array<br>
      Of diamond-sparkles died.<br>
      And lo! the far star cried:<br>
      "My light has lost its way!"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Ages on ages passed:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The light returned, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you seen,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; What have you heard&#8212;<br>
      O ray serene,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; O flame-winged bird<br>
      I loosed on endless air?<br>
      Why do you look so faint and white?"&#8212;<br>
      Said the star to its light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O star," said the tremulous ray,<br>
      "Grief and struggle I found.<br>
      Horror impeded my way.<br>
      Many a star and sun<br>
      I passed and touched, on my round.<br>
      Many a life undone<br>
      I lit with a tender gleam:<br>
      I shone in the lover's eyes,<br>
      And soothed the maiden's dream.<br>
      But alas for the stifling mist of lies!<br>
      Alas, for the wrath of the battle-field<br>
      Where my glance was mixed with blood!<br>
      And woe for the hearts by hate congealed,<br>
      And the crime that rolls like a flood!<br>
      Too vast is the world for me;<br>
      Too vast for the sparkling dew<br>
      Of a force like yours to renew.<br>
      Hopeless the world's immensity!<br>
      The suns go on without end:<br>
      The universe holds no friend:<br>
      And so I come back to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go," said the star to its light:<br>
      "You have not told me aright.<br>
      This you have taught: I am one<br>
      In a million of million others&#8212;<br>
      Stars, or planets, or men;&#8212;<br>
      And all of these are my brothers.<br>
      Carry that message, and then<br>
      My guerdon of praise you have won!<br>
      Say that I serve in my place:<br>
      Say I will hide my own face<br>
      Ere the sorrows of others I shun.<br>
      So, then, my trust you'll requite.<br>
      Go!"&#8212;said the star to its light.

      Here stands the great tree still, with broad bent head;<br>

      The leaf-dimmed light he questioned, and she spoke;<br>
      Then on them both, supreme, love's radiance broke.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in the elm</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet Jessamine we called her; for she shone<br>
      Like blossoms that in sun and shade have grown,<br>
      Gathering from each alike a perfect white,<br>
      Whose rich bloom breaks opaque through darkest night.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in the elm</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this her sweetness Walt, her lover, sought<br>
      To win her; wooed her here, his heart o'er fraught<br>
      With fragrance of her being; and gained his plea.<br>
      So "We will wed," they said, "beneath this tree."<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in the
      elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet dreams of conquering greater prize for her<br>
      Roused his wild spirit with a glittering spur.<br>
      Eager for wealth, far, far from home he sailed;<br>
      And life paused;&#8212;while she watched joy vanish,
      veiled.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in the
      elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, better at the elm-tree's sunbrowned feet<br>
      If he had been content to let life fleet<br>
      Its wonted way!&#8212;lord of his little farm,<br>
      In zest of joys or cares unmixed with harm.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in the
      elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      For, as against a snarling sea one steers,<br>
      He battled vainly with the surging years;<br>
      While ever Jessamine must watch and pine,<br>
      Her vision bounded by the bleak sea-line.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in the
      elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then silence fell; and all the neighbors said<br>
      That Walt had married, faithless, or was dead:<br>
      Unmoved in constancy, her tryst she kept,<br>
      Each night beneath the tree, ere sorrow slept.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in the
      elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      So, circling years went by, till in her face<br>
      Slow melancholy wrought a mingled grace,<br>
      Of early joy with suffering's hard alloy&#8212;<br>
      Refined and rare, no doom could e'er destroy.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs
      low in the elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes at twilight, when sweet Jessamine<br>
      Slow-footed, weary-eyed, passed by to win<br>
      The elm, we smiled for pity of her, and mused<br>
      On love that so could live, with love refused.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs
      low in the elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      And none could hope for her. But she had grown<br>
      Too high in love, for hope. She bloomed alone,<br>
      Aloft in proud devotion; and secure<br>
      Against despair; so sweet her faith, so sure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs
      low in the elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wandering lover knew not well her soul.<br>
      Discouraged, on disaster's changing shoal<br>
      Stranding, he waited; starved on selfish pride,<br>
      Long years; nor would obey love's homeward tide.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs
      low in the elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But, bitterly repenting of his sin,<br>
      Deeper at last he learned to look within<br>
      Sweet Jessamine's true heart&#8212;when the past, dead,<br>
      Mocked him with wasted years forever fled.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs
      low in the elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Late, late, oh late, beneath the tree stood two;<br>
      In trembling joy, and wondering "Is it true?"&#8212;<br>
      Two that were each like some strange, misty wraith:<br>
      Yet each on each gazed with a living faith.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs
      low in the elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to the tree-top sang the wedding-bell:<br>
      Even to the tree-top tolled the passing knell.<br>
      Beneath it Walt and Jessamine were wed,<br>
      Beneath it many a year has she lain dead.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in the
      elm.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here stands the great tree, still. But age has crept<br>
      Through every coil, while Walt each night has kept<br>
      The tryst alone. Hark! with what windy might<br>
      The boughs chant o'er her grave their burial-rite!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And the moon hangs low in
      the elm.</i>

      SAILOR'S SONG, RETURNING
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sea goes up; the sky comes down.<br>
      Oh, can you spy the ancient town,&#8212;<br>
      The granite hills so green and gray,<br>
      That rib the land behind the bay?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair winds, boys: send her home!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      O ye ho!
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years? Is it so long that we<br>
      Have lived upon the lonely sea?<br>
      Oh, often I thought we'd see the town,<br>
      When the sea went up, and the sky came down.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the winter winds would rouse<br>
      A memory of my father's house;<br>
      For round his windows and his door<br>
      They made the same deep, mouthless roar.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the summer's breezes beat,<br>
      Methought I saw the sunny street<br>
      Where stood my Kate. Beneath her hand<br>
      She gazed far out, far out from land.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      Farthest away, I oftenest dreamed<br>
      That I was with her. Then it seemed<br>
      A single stride the ocean wide<br>
      Had bridged, and brought me to her side.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      But though so near we're drawing, now,<br>
      'T is farther off&#8212;I know not how.<br>
      We sail and sail: we see no home.<br>
      Would that we into port were come!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, the same stars o'er the mast:<br>
      The mast sways round&#8212;however fast<br>
      We fly&#8212;still sways and swings around<br>
      One scanty circle's starry bound.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, many a month those stars have shone,<br>
      And many a golden morn has flown,<br>
      Since that so solemn, happy morn,<br>
      When, I away, my babe was born.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, though so near we're drawing, now,<br>
      'T is farther off&#8212;I know not how:&#8212;<br>
      I would not aught amiss had come<br>
      To babe or mother there, at home!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      'T is but a seeming: swiftly rush<br>
      The seas, beneath. I hear the crush<br>
      Of foamy ridges 'gainst the prow.<br>
      Longing outspeeds the breeze, I know.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!
    </p>
    <p>
      Patience, my mates! Though not this eve<br>
      We cast our anchor, yet believe,<br>
      If but the wind holds, short the run:<br>
      We'll sail in with to-morrow's sun.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O ye ho, boys. Spread her wings!<br>

    <h3>
      BRIDE BROOK
    </h3>
    <p>
      Wide as the sky Time spreads his hand,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And blindly over us there blows<br>
      A swarm of years that fill the land,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Then fade, and are as fallen snows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold, the flakes rush thick and fast;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Or are they years, that come between,&#8212;<br>
      When, peering back into the past,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; I search the legendary scene?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay. Marshaled down the open coast,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Fearless of that low rampart's frown,<br>
      The winter's white-winged, footless host<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Beleaguers ancient Saybrook town.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the settlers wake they stare<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; On woods half-buried, white and green,<br>
      A smothered world, an empty air:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Never had such deep drifts been seen!
    </p>
    <p>
      But "Snow lies light upon my heart!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; An thou," said merry Jonathan Rudd,<br>
      "Wilt wed me, winter shall depart,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And love like spring for us shall bud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, how," said Mary, "may that be?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; No minister nor magistrate<br>
      Is here, to join us solemnly;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And snow-banks bar us, every gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Winthrop at Pequot Harbor lies,"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; He laughed. And with the morrow's sun<br>
      He faced the deputy's dark eyes:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "How soon, sir, may the rite be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Saybrook? There the power's not mine,"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Said he. "But at the brook we'll meet,<br>
      That ripples down the boundary line;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; There you may wed, and Heaven shall see't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Forth went, next day, the bridal train<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Through vistas dreamy with gray light.<br>
      The waiting woods, the open plain,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Arrayed in consecrated white,
    </p>
    <p>
      Received and ushered them, along.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The very beasts before them fled,<br>
      Charmed by the spell of inward song<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; These lovers' hearts around them spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four men with netted foot-gear shod<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Bore the maid's carrying-chair aloft;<br>
      She swayed above, as roses nod<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; On the lithe stem their bloom-weight soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last beside the brook they stood,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With Winthrop and his followers;<br>
      The maid in flake-embroidered hood,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The magistrate well cloaked in furs,
    </p>
    <p>
      That, parting, showed a glimpse beneath<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of ample, throat-encircling ruff<br>
      As white as some wind-gathered wreath<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of snow quilled into plait and puff.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few grave words, a question asked;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Eyelids that with the answer fell<br>
      Like falling petals;&#8212;form that tasked<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Brief time;&#8212;and so was wrought the spell!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then "Brooklet," Winthrop smiled and said,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Frost's finger on thy lip makes dumb<br>
      The voice wherewith thou shouldst have sped<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; These lovers on their way. But, come,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henceforth forever be thou known<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; By memory of this day's fair bride:<br>
      So shall thy slender music's moan<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Sweeter into the ocean glide!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then laughed they all, and sudden beams<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of sunshine quivered through the sky.<br>
      Below the ice, the unheard stream's<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Clear heart thrilled on in ecstasy;
    </p>
    <p>
      And lo, a visionary blush<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Stole warmly o'er the voiceless wild;<br>
      And in her rapt and wintry hush<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The lonely face of Nature smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Time, what wilt thou? Vanished quite<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Is all that tender vision now;<br>
      And, like lost snow-flakes in the night,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Mute are the lovers as their vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And O thou little, careless brook,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou thy tender trust forgot?<br>
      Her modest memory forsook,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose name, known once, thou utterest not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring wakes the rill's blithe minstrelsy;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In willow bough or alder bush<br>
      Birds sing, o'er golden filigree<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of pebbles 'neath the flood's clear gush;
    </p>
    <p>
      But none can tell us of that name<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; More than the "Mary." Men still say<br>
      "Bride Brook" in honor of her fame;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; But all the rest has passed away.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; It, too, was once a murmuring tree;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its withered, sad, imprisoned
      ghost<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Echoes my melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come close, and lay your listening ear<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Against the bare and branchless wood.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you not hear it crooning
      clear,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As though it
      understood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened to the branchless pole<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; That held aloft the singing wire;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard its muffled music roll,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stirred with sweet
      desire:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O wire more soft than seasoned lute,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou no sunlit word for me?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though long to me so coyly mute,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart may speak
      through thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened, but it was in vain.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; At first, the wind's old wayward will<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drew forth the tearless, sad
      refrain.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That ceased; and all was
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly some kindling shock<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Struck flashing through the wire: a bird,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poised on it, screamed and flew; the
      flock<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose with him; wheeled
      and whirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to my soul there came this sense:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Her heart has answered unto thine;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She comes, to-night. Go, speed thee
      hence:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet her; no more
      repine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the fancy was far-fetched;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, perhaps, it hinted true.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere moonrise, Love, a hand was
      stretched<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In mine, that gave
      me&#8212;you!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so more dear to me has grown<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Than rarest tones swept from the lyre,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minor movement of that moan<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In yonder singing wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor care I for the will of states,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Or aught beside, that smites that string,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then so close it knit our
      fates,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time the bird took
      wing!

      Dear love, let this my song fly to you:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance forget it came from me.<br>
      It shall not vex you, shall not woo you;<br>

      This little song my whole heart carries,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And ne'er will bear it back again.

      For if its silent passion grieve you,<br>

      With my beloved I lingered late one night.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; At last the hour when I must leave her came:<br>

      Possessed me that the long sweet evening might<br>
      Prelude some sudden storm, whereby delight<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Should perish. What if death, ere dawn, should
      claim<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; One of us? What, though living, not the same<br>

    <p>
      Changed did I find her, truly, the next day:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Ne'er could I see her as of old again.<br>
      That strange mood seemed to draw a cloud away,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And let her beauty pour through every vein<br>
      Sunlight and life, part of me. Thus the lover<br>
      With each new morn a new world may discover.

      NIGHT IN NEW YORK

    <p>
      Haunted by unknown feet&#8212;<br>
      Ways of the midnight hour!<br>
      Strangely you murmur below me,<br>
      Strange is your half-silent power.<br>
      Places of life and of death,<br>
      Numbered and named as streets,<br>
      What, through your channels of stone,<br>
      Is the tide that unweariedly beats?<br>
      A whisper, a sigh-laden breath,<br>
      Is all that I hear of its flowing.<br>
      Footsteps of stranger and foe&#8212;<br>
      Footsteps of friends, could we meet&#8212;<br>
      Alike to me in my sorrow;<br>
      Alike to a life left alone.<br>
      Yet swift as my heart they throb,<br>
      They fall thick as tears on the stone:<br>
      My spirit perchance may borrow<br>
      New strength from their eager tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Still ever that slip and slide<br>
      Of the feet that shuffle or glide,<br>
      And linger or haste through the populous waste<br>
      Of the shadowy, dim-lit square!<br>
      And I know not, from the sound,<br>
      As I sit and ponder within,<br>
      The goal to which those steps are bound,&#8212;<br>
      On hest of mercy, or hest of sin,<br>
      Or joy's short-measured round;<br>
      Yet a meaning deep they bear<br>
      In their vaguely muffled din.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roar of the multitude,<br>
      Chafe of the million-crowd,<br>
      To this you are all subdued<br>
      In the murmurous, sad night-air!<br>
      Yet whether you thunder aloud,<br>
      Or hush your tone to a prayer,<br>
      You chant amain through the modern maze<br>
      The only epic of our days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Still as death are the places of life;<br>
      The city seems crumbled and gone,<br>
      Sunk 'mid invisible deeps&#8212;<br>
      The city so lately rife<br>
      With the stir of brain and brawn.<br>
      Haply it only sleeps;<br>
      But what if indeed it were dead,<br>
      And another earth should arise<br>
      To greet the gray of the dawn?<br>
      Faint then our epic would wail<br>
      To those who should come in our stead.<br>
      But what if that earth were ours?<br>
      What if, with holier eyes,<br>
      We should meet the new hope, and not fail?

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Weary, the night grows pale:<br>
      With a blush as of opening flowers<br>
      Dimly the east shines red.<br>
      Can it be that the morn shall fulfil<br>
      My dream, and refashion our clay<br>
      As the poet may fashion his rhyme?<br>
      Hark to that mingled scream<br>
      Rising from workshop and mill&#8212;<br>
      Hailing some marvelous sight;<br>
      Mighty breath of the hours,<br>
      Poured through the trumpets of steam;<br>
      Awful tornado of time,<br>

      THE SONG-SPARROW
    </h3>
    <p>
      Glimmers gray the leafless thicket<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Close beside my garden gate,<br>
      Where, so light, from post to picket<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Hops the sparrow, blithe, sedate;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, with meekly folded wing,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes to sun himself and sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was there, perhaps, last year,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; That his little house he built;<br>
      For he seems to perk and peer,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And to twitter, too, and tilt<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bare branches in between,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a fond, familiar mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, I know, there was a nest,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Held there by the sideward thrust<br>
      Of those twigs that touch his breast;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Though 'tis gone now. Some rude gust<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caught it, over-full of
      snow,&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bent the bush,&#8212;and stole it
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus our highest holds are lost,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In the ruthless winter's wind,<br>
      When, with swift-dismantling frost,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The green woods we dwelt in, thinn'd<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their leafage, grow too cold<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For frail hopes of summer's mold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if we, with spring-days mellow,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Wake to woeful wrecks of change,<br>
      And the sparrow's ritornello<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Scaling still its old sweet range;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we do a better thing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than, with him, still build and
      sing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, my sparrow, thou dost breed<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Thought in me beyond all telling;<br>
      Shootest through me sunlight, seed,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And fruitful blessing, with that welling<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ripple of ecstatic rest<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gurgling ever from thy breast!
    </p>
    <p>
      And thy breezy carol spurs<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Vital motion in my blood,<br>
      Such as in the sap-wood stirs,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Swells and shapes the pointed bud<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the lilac; and besets<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hollow thick with violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I know not any charm<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; That can make the fleeting time<br>
      Of thy sylvan, faint alarm<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Suit itself to human rhyme:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my yearning rhythmic word<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does thee grievous wrong, blithe
      bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, however thou hast wrought<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; This wild joy on heart and brain,<br>
      It is better left untaught.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Take thou up the song again:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing sad afloat<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the tide that swells thy throat!

      &nbsp;&nbsp; The echo of iterant drums,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Brought by the breezes light<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; From the files that follow the road.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; A moment their guns have glowed<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Sun-smitten: then out of sight<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; They suddenly sink,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Like men who touch a new grave's brink!

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was the march began,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The march of Morgan's
      riflemen,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who like iron held the van<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In unhappy Arnold's plan<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To win Wolfe's daring
      fame again.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With them, by her husband's
      side,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jemima Warner, nobly
      free,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moved more fair than when, a
      bride,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One year since, she
      strove to hide<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blush it was a joy to see.

    <h4>
      III
    </h4>
    <p>
      O distant, terrible forests of Maine,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With huge trees numberless as the rain<br>
      That falls on your lonely lakes!<br>
      (It falls and sings through the years, but wakes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; No answering echo of joy or pain.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Your tangled wilderness was tracked<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With struggle and sorrow and vengeful act<br>
      'Gainst Puritan, pagan, and priest.<br>
      Where wolf and panther and serpent ceased,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Man added the horrors your dark maze lacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land was scarred with deeds not good,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Like the fretting of worms on withered wood.<br>
      What if its venomous spell<br>
      Breathed into Arnold a prompting of Hell,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With slow empoisoning force indued?
    </p>
    <h4>
      IV
    </h4>
    <p>
      As through that dreary realm he went,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Followed a shape of dark portent:&#8212;<br>
      Pard-like, of furtive eye, with brain<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To treason narrowing, Aaron Burr,<br>
      Moved loyal-seeming in the train,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Led by the arch-conspirator.<br>
      And craven Enos closed the rear,<br>
      Whose honor's flame died out in fear.<br>
      Not sooner does the dry bough burn<br>
      And into fruitless ashes turn,<br>
      Than he with whispered, false command<br>
      Drew back the hundreds in his hand;<br>
      Fled like a shade; and all forsook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever Arnold bent his look,<br>
      Danger and doubt around him hung;<br>
      And pale Disaster, shrouded, flung<br>
      Black omens in his track, as though<br>
      The fingers of a future woe<br>
      Already clutched his life, to wring<br>
      Some expiation for the thing<br>
      That he was yet to do. A chill<br>
      Struck helpless many a steadfast will<br>
      Within the ranks; the very air<br>
      Rang with a thunder-toned despair:<br>
      The hills seemed wandering to and fro,<br>
      Like lost guides blinded by the snow.
    </p>
    <h4>
      V
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yet faithful still 'mid woe and doubt<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; One woman's loyal heart&#8212;whose pain<br>
      Filled it with pure celestial light&#8212;<br>
      Shone starry-constant like the North,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Or that still radiance beaming forth<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; From sacred lights in some lone fane.<br>
      But he whose ring Jemima wore,<br>
      By want and weariness all unstrung,<br>
      Though strong and honest of heart and young,<br>
      Shrank at the blast that pierced so frore&#8212;<br>
      Like a huge, invisible bird of prey<br>
      Furious launched from Labrador<br>
      And the granite cliffs of Saguenay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the bleak Dead River's banks<br>
      They forced amain their frozen way;<br>
      But ever from the thinning ranks<br>
      Shapes of ice would reel and fall,<br>
      Human shapes, whose dying prayer<br>
      Floated, a mute white mist, in air;<br>
      The crowding snow their pall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spectre-like Famine drew near;<br>
      Her doom-word hummed in his ear:<br>
      Ah, weak were woman's hands to reach<br>
      And save him from the hellish charms<br>
      And wizard motion of those arms!<br>
      Yet only noble womanhood<br>
      The wife her dauntless part could teach:<br>
      She shared with him the last dry food<br>
      And thronged with hopefulness her speech,<br>
      As when hard by her home the flood<br>
      Of rushing Conestoga fills<br>
      Its depth afresh from springtide rills!
    </p>
    <p>
      All, all in vain!<br>
      For far behind the invading rout<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; These two were left alone;<br>
      And in the waste their wildest shout<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed but a smothered groan.<br>
      Like sheeted wanderers from the grave<br>
      They moved, and yet seemed not to stir,<br>
      As icy gorge and sere-leaf'd grove<br>
      Of withered oak and shrouded fir<br>
      Were passed, and onward still they strove;<br>
      While the loud wind's artillery clave<br>
      The air, and furious sleety rain<br>
      Swung like a sword above the plain!
    </p>
    <h4>
      VI
    </h4>
    <p>
      They crossed the hills; they came to where<br>
      Through an arid gloom the river Chaudiere<br>
      Fled like a Maenad with outstreaming hair;<br>
      And there the soldier sank, and died.<br>
      Death-dumb he fell; yet ere life sped,<br>
      Child-like on her knee he laid his head.<br>
      She strove to pray; but all words fled<br>
      Save those their love had sanctified.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then her voice rose waveringly<br>
      To the notes of a mother's lullaby;<br>
      But her song was only "Ah, must thou die?"<br>
      And to her his eyes death-still replied.
    </p>
    <h4>
      VII
    </h4>
    <p>
      Dead leaves and stricken boughs<br>
      She heaped o'er the fallen form&#8212;<br>
      Wolf nor hawk nor lawless storm<br>
      Him from his rest should rouse;<br>
      But first, with solemn vows,<br>
      Took rifle, pouch, and horn,<br>
      And the belt that he had worn.<br>
      Then, onward pressing fast<br>
      Through the forest rude and vast,<br>
      Hunger-wasted, fever-parch'd,<br>
      Many bitter days she marched<br>
      With bleeding feet that spurned the flinty pain;<br>
      One thought always throbbing through her brain:<br>
      "They shall never say, 'He was afraid,'&#8212;<br>
      They shall never cry, 'The coward stayed!'"
    </p>
    <h4>
      VIII
    </h4>
    <p>
      Now the wilderness is passed;<br>
      Now the first hut reached, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ho, dwellers by the frontier trail,<br>
      Come forth and greet the bride of war!<br>
      From cabin and rough settlement<br>
      They come to speed her on her way&#8212;<br>
      Maidens, whose ruddy cheeks grow pale<br>
      With pity never felt before;<br>
      Children that cluster at the door;<br>
      Mothers, whose toil-worn hands are lent<br>
      To help, or bid her longer stay.<br>
      But through them all she passes on,<br>
      Strangely martial, fair and wan;<br>
      Nor waits to listen to their cheers<br>
      That sound so faintly in her ears.<br>
      For now all scenes around her shift,<br>
      Like those before a racer's eyes<br>
      When, foremost sped and madly swift,<br>
      Quick stretching toward the goal he flies,<br>
      Yet feels his strength wane with his breath,<br>
      And purpose fail 'mid fears of death,&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      Till, like the flashing of a lamp,<br>
      Starts forth the sight of Arnold's camp,&#8212;<br>
      The bivouac flame, and sinuous gleam<br>
      Of steel,&#8212;where, crouched, the army waits,<br>
      Ere long, beyond the midnight stream,<br>
      To storm Quebec's ice-mounded gates.

    <h4>

    <p>
      Then to the leader she was brought,<br>
      And spoke her simply loyal thought.<br>
      If, 'mid the shame of after-days,<br>
      The man who wronged his country's trust<br>
      (Yet now in worth outweighed all praise)<br>
      Remembered what this woman wrought,<br>
      It should have bowed him to the dust!<br>
      "Humbly my soldier-husband tried<br>
      To do his part. He served,&#8212;and died.<br>
      But honor did not die. His name<br>
      And honor&#8212;bringing both, I came;<br>
      And this his rifle, here, to show,<br>
      While far away the tired heart sleeps,<br>
      To-day his faith with you he keeps!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Proudly the war bride, ending so,<br>
      Sank breathless in the dumb white snow.

      A RUNE OF THE RAIN
    </h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; O many-toned rain!<br>
      O myriad sweet voices of the rain!<br>
      How welcome is its delicate overture<br>
      At evening, when the moist and glowing west<br>
      Seals all things with cool promise of night's rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; At first it would allure<br>
      The earth to kinder mood,<br>
      With dainty flattering<br>
      Of soft, sweet pattering:<br>
      Faintly now you hear the tramp<br>
      Of the fine drops, falling damp<br>
      On the dry, sun-seasoned ground<br>
      And the thirsty leaves, resound.<br>
      But anon, imbued<br>
      With a sudden, bounding access<br>
      Of passion, it relaxes<br>
      All timider persuasion.<br>
      And, with nor pretext nor occasion,<br>
      Its wooing redoubles;<br>
      And pounds the ground, and bubbles<br>
      In sputtering spray,<br>
      Flinging itself in a fury<br>
      Of flashing white away;<br>
      Till the dusty road,<br>
      Dank-perfumed, is o'erflowed;<br>
      And the grass, and the wide-hung trees,<br>
      The vines, the flowers in their beds,&#8212;<br>
      The virid corn that to the breeze<br>
      Rustles along the garden-rows,&#8212;<br>
      Visibly lift their heads,<br>
      And, as the quick shower wilder grows,<br>
      Upleap with answering kisses to the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the slow and pleasant murmur<br>
      Of its subsiding,<br>
      As the pulse of the storm beats firmer,<br>
      And the steady rain<br>
      Drops into a cadenced chiding!<br>
      Deep-breathing rain,<br>
      The sad and ghostly noise<br>
      Wherewith thou dost complain&#8212;-<br>
      Thy plaintive, spiritual voice,<br>
      Heard thus at close of day<br>
      Through vaults of twilight gray&#8212;<br>
      Vexes me with sweet pain;<br>
      And still my soul is fain<br>
      To know the secret of that yearning<br>
      Which in thine utterance I hear returning.<br>
      Hush, oh hush!<br>
      Break not the dreamy rush<br>
      Of the rain:<br>
      Touch not the marring doubt<br>
      Words bring to the certainty<br>
      Of its soft refrain;<br>
      But let the flying fringes flout<br>
      Their drops against the pane,<br>
      And the gurgling throat of the water-spout<br>
      Groan in the eaves amain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earth is wedded to the shower;<br>
      Darkness and awe gird round the bridal hour!

    <h4>
      II

    <p>
      O many-toned rain!<br>
      It hath caught the strain<br>
      Of a wilder tune,<br>
      Ere the same night's noon,<br>
      When dreams and sleep forsake me,<br>
      And sudden dread doth wake me,<br>
      To hear the booming drums of heaven beat<br>
      The long roll to battle; when the knotted cloud,<br>
      With an echoing loud,<br>
      Bursts asunder<br>
      At the sudden resurrection of the thunder;<br>
      And the fountains of the air,<br>
      Unsealed again, sweep, ruining, everywhere,<br>
      To wrap the world in a watery winding-sheet.
    </p>
    <h4>
      III
    </h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; O myriad sweet voices of the rain!<br>
      When the airy war doth wane,<br>
      And the storm to the east hath flown,<br>
      Cloaked close in the whirling wind,<br>
      There's a voice still left behind<br>
      In each heavy-hearted tree,<br>
      Charged with tearful memory<br>
      Of the vanished rain:<br>
      From their leafy lashes wet<br>
      Drip the dews of fresh regret<br>
      For the lover that's gone!<br>
      All else is still;<br>
      Yet the stars are listening,<br>
      And low o'er the wooded hill<br>
      Hangs, upon listless wing<br>
      Outspread, a shape of damp, blue cloud,<br>
      Watching, like a bird of evil<br>
      That knows nor mercy nor reprieval,<br>
      The slow and silent death of the pallid moon.

    <h4>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; But soon, returning duly,<br>
      Dawn whitens the wet hilltops bluely.<br>
      To her vision pure and cold<br>
      The night's wild tale is told<br>
      On the glistening leaf, in the mid-road pool,<br>
      The garden mold turned dark and cool,<br>
      And the meadows' trampled acres.<br>
      But hark, how fresh the song of the winged music-makers!<br>
      For now the moanings bitter,<br>
      Left by the rain, make harmony<br>
      With the swallow's matin-twitter,<br>
      And the robin's note, like the wind's in a tree.<br>
      The infant morning breathes sweet breath,<br>
      And with it is blent<br>
      The wistful, wild, moist scent<br>
      Of the grass in the marsh which the sea nourisheth:<br>
      And behold!<br>
      The last reluctant drop of the storm,<br>
      Wrung from the roof, is smitten warm<br>
      And turned to gold;<br>
      For in its veins doth run<br>
      The very blood of the bold, unsullied sun!

      BREAKERS

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Far out at sea there has been a storm,<br>
      And still, as they roll their liquid acres,<br>
      High-heaped the billows lower and glisten.<br>
      The air is laden, moist, and warm<br>
      With the dying tempest's breath;<br>
      And, as I walk the lonely strand<br>
      With sea-weed strewn, my forehead fanned<br>
      By wet salt-winds, I watch the breakers,<br>
      Furious sporting, tossed and tumbling,<br>
      Shatter here with a dreadful rumbling&#8212;<br>
      Watch, and muse, and vainly listen<br>
      To the inarticulate mumbling<br>
      Of the hoary-headed deep;<br>
      For who may tell me what it saith,<br>
      Muttering, moaning as in sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly and heavily<br>
      Comes in the sea,<br>
      With memories of storm o'erfreighted,<br>
      With heaving heart and breath abated,<br>
      Pregnant with some mysterious, endless sorrow,<br>
      And seamed with many a gaping, sighing furrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly and heavily<br>
      Grows the green water-mound;<br>
      But drawing ever nigher,<br>
      Towering ever higher,<br>
      Swollen with an inward rage<br>
      Naught but ruin can assuage,<br>
      Swift, now, without sound,<br>
      Creeps stealthily<br>
      Up to the shore&#8212;<br>
      Creeps, creeps and undulates;<br>
      As one dissimulates<br>
      Till, swayed by hateful frenzy,<br>
      Through passion grown immense, he<br>
      Bursts forth hostilely;<br>
      And rising, a smooth billow&#8212;<br>
      Its swelling, sunlit dome<br>
      Thinned to a tumid ledge<br>
      With keen, curved edge<br>
      Like the scornful curl<br>
      Of lips that snarl&#8212;<br>
      O'ertops itself and breaks<br>
      Into a raving foam;<br>
      So springs upon the shore<br>
      With a hungry roar;<br>
      Its first fierce anger slakes<br>
      On the stony shallow;<br>
      And runs up on the land,<br>
      Licking the smooth, hard sand,<br>
      Relentless, cold, yet wroth;<br>
      And dies in savage froth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Then with its backward swirl<br>
      The sands and the stones, how they whirl!<br>
      O, fiercely doth it draw<br>
      Them to its chasm'd maw,<br>
      And against it in vain<br>
      They linger and strain;<br>
      And as they slip away<br>
      Into the seething gray<br>
      Fill all the thunderous air<br>
      With the horror of their despair,<br>
      And their wild terror wreak<br>
      In one hoarse, wailing shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; But scarce is this done,<br>
      When another one<br>
      Falls like the bolt from a bellowing gun,<br>
      And sucks away the shore<br>
      As that did before:<br>
      And another shall smother it o'er.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Then there's a lull&#8212;a half-hush;<br>
      And forward the little waves rush,<br>
      Toppling and hurrying,<br>
      Each other worrying,<br>
      And in their haste<br>
      Run to waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Yet again is heard the trample<br>
      Of the surges high and ample:<br>
      Their dreadful meeting&#8212;<br>
      The wild and sudden breaking&#8212;<br>
      The dinting, and battering, and beating,<br>
      And swift forsaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And ever they burst and boom,<br>
      A numberless host;<br>
      Like heralds of doom<br>
      To the trembling coast;<br>
      And ever the tangled spray<br>
      Is tossed from the fierce affray,<br>
      And, as with spectral arms<br>
      That taunt and beckon and mock,<br>
      And scatter vague alarms,<br>
      Clasps and unclasps the rock;<br>
      Listlessly over it wanders;<br>
      Moodily, madly maunders,<br>
      And hissingly falls<br>
      From the glistening walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; So all day along the shore<br>
      Shout the breakers, green and hoar,<br>
      Weaving out their weird tune;<br>
      Till at night the full moon<br>
      Weds the dark with that ring<br>
      Of gold that you see her fling<br>
      On the misty air.<br>
      Then homeward slow returning<br>
      To slumbers deep I fare,<br>
      Filled with an infinite yearning,<br>
      With thoughts that rise and fall<br>
      To the sound of the sea's hollow call,<br>
      Breathed now from white-lit waves that reach<br>
      Cold fingers o'er the damp, dark beach,<br>
      To scatter a spray on my dreams;<br>
      Till the slow and measured rote<br>
      Brings a drowsy ease<br>
      To my spirit, and seems<br>
      To set it soothingly afloat<br>
      On broad and buoyant seas<br>
      Of endless rest, lulled by the dirge<br>
      Of the melancholy surge.

    <h3>
      BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO
    </h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is Blackmouth?" Well, that's hard to
      say.<br>
      Mebbe he might ha' told you, 't other day,<br>
      If you'd been here. Now,&#8212;he's gone away.<br>
      Come to think on, 't wouldn't ha' been no use<br>
      If you'd called here earlier. His excuse<br>
      Always was, whenever folks would ask him<br>
      Where he hailed from, an' <i>would</i> tease an' task
      him;&#8212;<br>
      What d' you s'pose? He just said, "I don' know."
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; That was truth. He came here long ago;<br>
      But, before that, he'd been born somewhere:<br>
      The conundrum started first, right there.<br>
      Little shaver&#8212;afore he knew his name<br>
      Or the place from whereabouts he came&#8212;<br>
      On a wagon-train the Apaches caught him.<br>
      Killed the old folks! But this cus'&#8212;they brought
      him<br>
      Safe away from fire an' knife an' arrows.<br>
      So'thin' 'bout him must have touched their marrows:<br>
      They was merciful;&#8212;treated him real good;<br>
      Brought him up to man's age well's they could.<br>
      Now, d' you b'lieve me, that there likely lad,<br>
      For all they used him so, went to the bad:<br>
      Leastways left the red men, that he knew,<br>
      'N' come to look for folks like me an' you;&#8212;<br>
      Goldarned white folks that he never saw.<br>
      Queerest thing was&#8212;though he loved a squaw,<br>
      'T was on her account he planned escape;<br>
      Shook the Apaches, an' took up red tape<br>
      With the U. S. gov'ment arter a while;<br>
      Tho' they do say gov'ment may be vile,<br>
      Mean an' treacherous an' deceivin'. Well,<br>
      <i>I</i> ain't sayin' our gov'ment is a sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Bocanegra&#8212;Spanish term&#8212;I've
      heard<br>
      Stands for "Blackmouth." Now this curious bird,<br>
      Known as Bocanegra, gave his life<br>
      Most for others. First, he saved his wife;<br>
      Her I spoke of;&#8212;nothin' but a squaw.<br>
      You might wonder by what sort of law<br>
      He, a white man born, should come to love her.<br>
      But 't was somehow so: he <i>did</i> discover<br>
      Beauty in her, of the holding kind.<br>
      Some men love the light, an' some the shade.<br>
      Round that little Indian girl there played<br>
      Soft an' shadowy tremblings, like the dark<br>
      Under trees; yet now an' then a spark,<br>
      Quick 's a firefly, flashing from her eyes,<br>
      Made you think of summer-midnight skies.<br>
      She was faithful, too, like midnight stars.<br>
      As for Blackmouth, if you'd seen the scars<br>
      Made by wounds he suffered for her sake,<br>
      You'd have called <i>him</i> true, and no mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Growin' up a man, he scarcely met<br>
      Other white folks; an' his heart was set<br>
      On this red girl. Yet he said: "We'll wait.<br>
      You must never be my wedded mate<br>
      Till we reach the white man's country. There,<br>
      Everything that's done is fair and square."<br>
      Patiently they stayed, thro' trust or doubt,<br>
      Till tow'rds Colorado he could scout<br>
      Some safe track. He told her: "You go first.<br>
      All my joy goes with you:&#8212;that's the worst!<br>
      But <i>I</i> wait, to guard or hide the trail."
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Indians caught him; an' they gave
      him&#8212;hail;<br>
      Cut an' tortured him, till he was bleeding;<br>
      Yet they found that still they weren't succeeding.<br>
      "Where's that squaw?" they asked. "We'll have her blood!<br>
      Either that, or grind you into mud;<br>
      Pick your eyes out, too, if you can't see<br>
      Where she's gone to. Which, now, shall it be?<br>
      Tell us where she's hid."
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      "I'll show the way,"<br>
      Blackmouth says; an' leads toward dawn of day,<br>
      Till they come straight out beside the brink<br>
      Of a precipice that seems to sink<br>
      Into everlasting gulfs below.<br>
      "Loose me!" Blackmouth tells 'em. "But go slow."<br>
      Then they loosed him; and, with one swift leap,<br>
      Blackmouth swooped right down into the deep;&#8212;<br>
      Jumped out into space beyond the edge,<br>
      While the Apaches cowered along the ledge.<br>
      Seven hundred feet, they say. That's guff!<br>
      Seventy foot, I tell you, 's 'bout enough.<br>
      Indians called him a dead antelope;<br>
      But they couldn't touch the bramble-slope<br>
      Where he, bruised and stabbed, crawled under brush.<br>
      <i>Their</i> hand was beat hollow: <i>he</i> held a flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Day and night he limped or crawled along:<br>
      Winds blew hot, yet sang to him a song<br>
      (So he told me, once) that gave him hope.<br>
      Every time he saw a shadow grope<br>
      Down the hillsides, from a flying cloud,<br>
      Something touched his heart that made him proud:<br>
      Seemed to him he saw her dusky face<br>
      Watching over him, from place to place.<br>
      Every time the dry leaves rustled near,<br>
      Seemed to him she whispered, "Have no fear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; So at last he found her:&#8212;they were
      married.<br>
      But, from those days on, he always carried<br>
      Marks of madness; actually&#8212;yes!&#8212;<br>
      Trusted the good faith of these U. S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Indian hate an' deviltry he braved;<br>
      'N' scores an' scores of white men's lives he saved.<br>
      Just for that, his name should be engraved.<br>
      But it won't be! U. S. gov'ment dreads<br>
      Men who're taller 'n politicians' heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; All the while, his wife&#8212;tho' half
      despised<br>
      By the frontier folks that civilized<br>
      An' converted her&#8212;served by his side,<br>
      Helping faithfully, until she died.<br>
      Left alone, he lay awake o' nights,<br>
      Thinkin' what they'd both done for the whites.<br>
      Then he thought of her, and Indian people;<br>
      Tryin' to measure, by the church's steeple,<br>
      Just how Christian our great nation's been<br>
      Toward those native tribes so full of sin.<br>
      When he counted all the wrongs we've done<br>
      To the wild men of the setting sun,<br>
      Seem'd to him the gov'ment wa'n't quite fair.<br>
      When its notes came due, it wa'n't right there.<br>
      U. S. gov'ment promised Indians lots,<br>
      But at last it closed accounts with shots.<br>
      Mouth was black, perhaps;&#8212;but <i>he</i> was white.<br>
      Calling gov'ment black don't seem polite:<br>
      Yet I'll swear, its actions wouldn't show<br>
      'Longside Blackmouth's better 'n soot with snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir! Blackmouth took the other side:<br>
      Honestly for years an' years he tried<br>
      Getting justice for the Indians. He,<br>
      Risking life an' limb for you an' me;&#8212;<br>
      He, the man who proved his good intent<br>
      By his deeds, an' plainly showed he meant<br>
      He would die for us,&#8212;turned round an' said:<br>
      "White men have been saved. Now, save the red!"<br>
      But it didn't pan out. No one would hark.<br>
      "Let the prairie-dogs an' Blackmouth bark,"<br>
      Said our folks. And&#8212;no, he wa'n't resigned,<br>
      But concluded he had missed his find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>Where</i> is Blackmouth?" That I can't
      decide.<br>
      Red an' white men, both, he tried to serve;<br>
      But I guess, at last, he lost his nerve.<br>
      Kind o' tired out. See? He had his pride:<br>
      Gave his life for others, far 's he could,<br>
      Hoping it would do 'em some small good.<br>
      Didn't seem to be much use. An' so&#8212;<br>
      Well; you see that man, dropped in the snow,<br>
      Where the crowd is? Suicide, they say.<br>
      Looks as though he had quit work, to stay.<br>
      Bullet in the breast.&#8212;His <i>body</i> 's there;<br>
      But poor Blackmouth's gone&#8212;I don't know where!

      THE CHILD YEAR
    </h3>
    <h4>
      I
    </h4>
    <p>
      "Dying of hunger and sorrow:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; I die for my youth I fear!"<br>
      Murmured the midnight-haunting<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Voice of the stricken Year.
    </p>
    <p>
      There like a child it perished<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In the stormy thoroughfare:<br>
      The snow with cruel whiteness<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Had aged its flowing hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, little Year so fruitful,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, child that brought us bliss,<br>
      Must we so early lose you&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Our dear hopes end in this?
    </p>
    <h4>
      II
    </h4>
    <p>
      "Too young am I, too tender,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To bear earth's avalanche<br>
      Of wrong, that grinds down life-hope,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And makes my heart's-blood blanch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him who soon shall follow<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Where my tired feet have bled,<br>
      He must be older, shrewder,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Hard, cold, and selfish-bred&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or else like me be trampled<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Under the harsh world's heel.<br>
      &nbsp; 'Tis weakness to be youthful;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis death to love and feel."
    </p>
    <h4>
      III
    </h4>
    <p>
      Then saw I how the New Year<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Came like a scheming man,<br>
      With icy eyes, his forehead<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Wrinkled by care and plan
    </p>
    <p>
      For trade and rule and profit.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To him the fading child<br>
      Looked up and cried, "Oh, brother!"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; But died even while it smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down bent the harsh new-comer<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To lift with loving arm<br>
      The wanderer mute and fallen;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And lo! his eyes were warm;
    </p>
    <p>
      All changed he grew; the wrinkles<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Vanished: he, too, looked young&#8212;<br>
      As if that lost child's spirit<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Into his breast had sprung.
    </p>
    <p>
      So are those lives not wasted,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Too frail to bear the fray.<br>
      So Years may die, yet leave us<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Young hearts in a world grown gray.

    <h3>
      CHRISTENING
    </h3>
    <p>
      To-day I saw a little, calm-eyed child,&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Where soft lights rippled and the shadows
      tarried<br>
      Within a church's shelter arched and aisled,&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Peacefully wondering, to the altar carried;
    </p>
    <p>
      White-robed and sweet, in semblance of a flower;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; White as the daisies that adorned the
      chancel;<br>
      Borne like a gift, the young wife's natural dower,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Offered to God as her most precious hansel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then ceased the music, and the little one<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Was silent, with the multitude assembled<br>
      Hearkening; and when of Father and of Son<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke, the pastor's deep voice broke and
      trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she, the child, knew not the solemn words,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And suddenly yielded to a troublous wailing,<br>
      As helpless as the cry of frightened birds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose untried wings for flight are unavailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much the same, I thought, with older folk!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The blessing falls: we call it tribulation,<br>
      And fancy that we wear a sorrow's yoke,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Even at the moment of our consecration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pure daisy-child! Whatever be the form<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of dream or doctrine,&#8212;or of
      unbelieving,&#8212;<br>
      A hand may touch our heads, amid the storm<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of grief and doubt, to bless beyond bereaving;
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice may sound, in measured, holy rite<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of speech we know not, tho' its earnest
      meaning<br>
      Be clear as dew, and sure as starry light<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Gathered from some far-off celestial gleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wise is the ancient sacrament that blends<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; This weakling cry of children in our
      churches<br>
      With strength of prayer or anthem that ascends<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To Him who hearts of men and children searches;
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we are like the babe, who, soothed again,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Within her mother's cradling arm lay nested,<br>
      Bright as a new bud, now, refreshed by rain:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And on her hair, it seemed, heaven's radiance
      rested.

      From each tree that like a taper<br>

      BEFORE THE SNOW
    </h3>
    <p>
      Autumn is gone: through the blue woodlands bare<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Shatters the rainy wind. A myriad leaves,<br>
      Like birds that fly the mournful Northern air.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Flutter away from the old forest's eaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn is gone: as yonder silent rill,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Slow eddying o'er thick leaf-heaps lately
      shed,<br>
      My spirit, as I walk, moves awed and still,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; By thronging fancies wild and wistful led.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn is gone: alas, how long ago<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The grapes were plucked, and garnered was the
      grain!<br>
      How soon death settles on us, and the snow<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Wraps with its white alike our graves, our gain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea, autumn's gone! Yet it robs not my mood<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of that which makes moods dear,&#8212;some shoot
      of spring<br>
      Still sweet within me; or thoughts of yonder wood<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; We walked in,&#8212;memory's rare environing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, though they die, the seasons only take<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; A ruined substance. All that's best remains<br>
      In the essential vision that can make<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; One light for life, love, death, their joys,
      their pains.

    <p>
      Strange spell of youth for age, and age for youth,<br>
      Affinity between two forms of truth!&#8212;<br>
      As if the dawn and sunset watched each other,<br>
      Like and unlike as children of one mother<br>
      And wondering at the likeness. Ardent eyes<br>
      Of young men see the prophecy arise<br>
      Of what their lives shall be when all is told;<br>
      And, in the far-off glow of years called old,<br>
      Those other eyes look back to catch a trace<br>
      Of what was once their own unshadowed grace.<br>
      But here in our dear poet both are blended&#8212;<br>
      Ripe age begun, yet golden youth not ended;&#8212;<br>
      Even as his song the willowy scent of spring<br>
      Doth blend with autumn's tender mellowing,<br>
      And mixes praise with satire, tears with fun,<br>
      In strains that ever delicately run;<br>
      So musical and wise, page after page,<br>
      The sage a minstrel grows, the bard a sage.<br>
      The dew of youth fills yet his late-sprung flowers,<br>
      And day-break glory haunts his evening hours.<br>
      Ah, such a life prefigures its own moral:<br>
      That first "Last Leaf" is now a leaf of laurel,<br>
      Which&#8212;smiling not, but trembling at the
      touch&#8212;<br>
      Youth gives back to the hand that gave so much.

    <h3>
      THE SWORD DHAM
    </h3>
    <p>
      "How shall we honor the man who creates?"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Asked the Bedouin chief, the poet
      Antar;&#8212;<br>
      "Who unto the truth flings open our gates,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Or fashions new thoughts from the light of a
      star;<br>
      Or forges with craft of his finger and brain<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Some marvelous weapon we copy in vain;<br>
      Or chants to the winds a wild song that shall<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wander forever undying?
    </p>
    <p>
      "See! His reward is in envies and hates;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In lips that deny, or in stabs that may
      kill."<br>
      "Nay," said the smith; "for there's one here who waits<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Humbly to serve you with unmeasured skill,<br>
      Sure that no utmost devotion can fail,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Offered to <i>you</i>, nor unfriended assail<br>
      The heart of the hero and poet Antar, whose<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fame is undying!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak," said the chief. Then the smith: "O Antar,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; It is I who would serve you! I know, by the
      soul<br>
      Of the poet within you, no envy can bar<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The stream of your gratitude,&#8212;once let it
      roll.<br>
      Listen. The lightning, your camel that slew,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I</i> caught, and wrought in this sword-blade
      for you;&#8212;<br>
      Sword that no foe shall encounter unhurt, or<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depart from undying."
    </p>
    <p>
      Burst from the eyes of Antar a swift
      rain,&#8212;Gratitude's<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; glittering drops,&#8212;as he threw<br>
      One shining arm round the smith, like a chain.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Closer the man to his bosom he drew;<br>
      Thankful, caressing, with "Great is my debt."<br>
      &nbsp; "Yea," said the smith, and his eyelids were wet:<br>
      "I knew the sword Dham would unite me with<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you in an honor undying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So?" asked the chief, as his thumb-point at will<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Silently over the sword's edge played.<br>
      &#8212;"Ay!" said the smith, "but there's one thing,
      still:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the smiter, shall smite with this
      blade?"<br>
      Jealous, their eyes met; and fury awoke.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>I</i> am the smiter!" Antar cried. One
      stroke<br>
      Rolled the smith's head from his neck, and gave<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him remembrance undying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seek now who may, no search will avail:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; No man the mate of this weapon shall own!"<br>
      Yet, in his triumph, the chieftain made wail:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Slain is the craftsman, the one friend
      alone<br>
      Able to honor the man who creates.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; I slew him&#8212;<i>I</i>, who am poet! O
      fates,<br>
      Grant that the envious blade slaying artists shall<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make them undying!"

      "AT THE GOLDEN GATE"
    </h3>
    <p>
      Before the golden gate she stands,<br>
      With drooping head, with idle hands<br>
      Loose-clasped, and bent beneath the weight<br>
      Of unseen woe. Too late, too late!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those carved and fretted,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starred, resetted<br>
      Panels shall not open ever<br>
      To her who seeks the perfect mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the tearless enter there:<br>
      Only the soul that, like a prayer,<br>
      No bolt can stay, no wall may bar,<br>
      Shall dream the dreams grief cannot mar.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No door of cedar,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas, shall lead her<br>
      Unto the stream that shows forever<br>
      Love's face like some reflected star!
    </p>
    <p>
      They say that golden barrier hides<br>
      A realm where deathless spring abides;<br>
      Where flowers shall fade not, and there floats<br>
      Thro' moon-rays mild or sunlit motes&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Mid dewy alleys<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That gird the palace,<br>
      And fountain'd spray's unceasing quiver&#8212;<br>
      A dulcet rain of song-birds' notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sultan lord knew not her name;<br>
      But to the door that fair shape came:<br>
      The hour had struck, the way was right,<br>
      Traced by her lamp's pale, flickering light.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But ah, whose error<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has brought this terror?<br>
      Whose fault has foiled her fond endeavor?<br>
      The gate swings to: her hope takes flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harp, the song, the nightingales<br>
      She hears, beyond. The night-wind wails<br>
      Without, to sound of feast within,<br>
      While here she stands, shut out by sin.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be that revel<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of angel or devil,<br>
      She longs to sit beside the giver,<br>
      That she at last her prize may win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lamp has fallen; her eyes are wet;<br>
      Frozen she stands, she lingers yet;<br>
      But through the garden's gladness steals<br>
      A whisper that each heart congeals&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moan of grieving<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond relieving,<br>
      Which makes the proudest of them shiver.<br>
      And suddenly the sultan kneels!
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was quenched; he found her dead,<br>
      When dawn had turned the threshold red.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Her face was calm and sad as fate:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; His sin, not hers, made her too late.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
      think, unbidden<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She
      brought him, hidden,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; A truer bliss that came back never<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To him, unblest, who closed the gate.

      Weaves a mantle rich and dark,<br>
      Purpled over, deep. But mark<br>
      How she scatters o'er the wool<br>
      Woven shapes, till it is full<br>
      Of men that struggle close, complex;<br>
      Short-clipp'd steeds with wrinkled necks<br>
      Arching high; spear, shield, and all<br>
      The panoply that doth recall<br>
      Mighty war; such war as e'en<br>
      For Helen's sake is waged, I ween.<br>
      Purple is the groundwork: good!<br>
      All the field is stained with blood&#8212;<br>
      Blood poured out for Helen's sake;<br>
      (Thread, run on; and shuttle, shake!)<br>
      But the shapes of men that pass<br>
      Are as ghosts within a glass,<br>
      Woven with whiteness of the swan,<br>
      Pale, sad memories, gleaming wan<br>
      From the garment's purple fold<br>
      Where Troy's tale is twined and told.<br>
      Well may Helen, as with tender<br>
      Touch of rosy fingers slender<br>
      She doth knit the story in<br>
      Of Troy's sorrow and her sin,<br>
      Feel sharp filaments of pain<br>
      Reeled off with the well-spun skein,<br>
      And faint blood-stains on her hands<br>
      From the shifting, sanguine strands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Gently, sweetly she doth sorrow:<br>
      What has been must be to-morrow;<br>
      Meekly to her fate she bows.<br>
      Heavenly beauties still will rouse<br>
      Strife and savagery in men:<br>
      Shall the lucid heavens, then,<br>
      Lose their high serenity,<br>
      Sorrowing over what must be?<br>
      If she taketh to her shame,<br>
      Lo, they give her not the blame,&#8212;<br>
      Priam's wisest counselors,<br>
      Aged men, not loving wars.<br>
      When she goes forth, clad in white,<br>
      Day-cloud touched by first moonlight,<br>
      With her fair hair, amber-hued<br>
      As vapor by the moon imbued<br>
      With burning brown, that round her clings,<br>
      See, she sudden silence brings<br>
      On the gloomy whisperers<br>
      Who would make the wrong all hers.<br>
      So, Helen, in thy silent room,<br>
      Labor at the storied loom;<br>
      (Thread, run on; and shuttle, shake!)<br>
      Let thy aching sorrow make<br>
      Something strangely beautiful<br>
      Of this fabric; since the wool<br>
      Comes so tinted from the Fates,<br>
      Dyed with loves, hopes, fears, and hates.<br>
      Thou shalt work with subtle force<br>
      All thy deep shade of remorse<br>
      In the texture of the weft,<br>
      That no stain on thee be left;&#8212;<br>
      Ay, false queen, shalt fashion grief,<br>
      Grief and wrong, to soft relief.<br>
      Speed the garment! It may chance,<br>
      Long hereafter, meet the glance,<br>
      Of Oenone; when her lord,<br>
      Now thy Paris, shall go tow'rd<br>
      Ida, at his last sad end,<br>
      Seeking her, his early friend,<br>
      Who alone can cure his ill,<br>
      Of all who love him, if she will.<br>
      It were fitting she should see<br>
      In that hour thine artistry,<br>
      And her husband's speechless corse<br>
      In the garment of remorse!
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; But take heed that in thy work<br>
      Naught unbeautiful may lurk.<br>
      Ah, how little signifies<br>
      Unto thee what fortunes rise,<br>
      What others fall! Thou still shall rule,<br>
      Still shalt twirl the colored spool.<br>
      Though thy yearning woman's eyes<br>
      Burn with glorious agonies,<br>
      Pitying the waste and woe,<br>
      And the heroes falling low<br>
      In the war around thee, here,<br>
      Yet the least, quick-trembling tear<br>
      'Twixt thy lids shall dearer be<br>
      Than life, to friend or enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; There are people on the earth<br>
      Doomed with doom of too great worth.<br>
      Look on Helen not with hate,<br>
      Therefore, but compassionate.<br>
      If she suffer not too much,<br>
      Seldom does she feel the touch<br>
      Of that fresh, auroral joy<br>
      Lighter spirits may decoy<br>
      To their pure and sunny lives.<br>
      Heavy honey 'tis she hives.<br>

      All that here she may control&#8212;<br>
      What of bitter memories,<br>

      Paris' passion, distant din<br>
      Of the war now drifting in<br>
      To her quiet&#8212;idle seems;<br>
      Idle as the lazy gleams<br>
      Of some stilly water's reach,<br>
      Seen from where broad vine-leaves pleach<br>
      A heavy arch; and, looking through,<br>

    <p>
      Deep, smoldering colors of the land and sea<br>
      Burn in these stones, that, by some mystery,<br>

      Scarlet of daybreak, sunset gleams half spent<br>
      In thick white cloud; pale moons that may have lent<br>
      Light to love's grieving; rose-illumined snows,<br>
      And veins of gold no mine depth ever gloomed;<br>
      All these, and green of thin-edged waves, are there.<br>

      Some soul once human,&#8212;wandering, in the snare<br>

      And now, like glinting sunbeams through the rain,<br>
      The rays of thought that through his spirit moved<br>
      Leap out from these mysterious forms again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colors of the jewels laugh and weep<br>
      As with his very voice. In them the wave<br>
      Of sorrow and joy that, with a changing sweep,<br>
      Bore him to misery or else made him blest<br>
      Still surges in melodious, wild unrest.<br>
      So when each gem in place I touch and take,<br>
      It murmurs what he thought or what he spake.
    </p>
    <h4>
      FIRST OPAL
    </h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; My heart is like an opal<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Made to lie upon your breast<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In dreams of ardor, clouded o'er<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; By endless joy's unrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And forever it shall haunt you<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With its mystic, changing ray:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Its light shall live when we lie dead,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With hearts at the heart of day!
    </p>
    <h4>
      SECOND OPAL
    </h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; If, from a careless hold,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One gem of these should fall,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; No power of art or gold<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its wholeness could recall:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The lustrous wonder dies<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In gleams of irised rain,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; As light fades out from the eyes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a soul is crushed by pain.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Take heed that from your hold<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My love you do not cast:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Dim, shattered, vapor-cold&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day would be its last.

      With all its tints in maze, that seem to quake<br>
      And leap in light, as if its heart would break:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gleam of the sea,<br>
      Translucent air,<br>
      Where every leaf alive with glee<br>

      Radiant life,<br>
      Face so fair&#8212;<br>
      Crowned with the gracious glory of wife&#8212;<br>
      Your glance lights all this happy day,<br>
      Your tender glow<br>
      And murmurs low<br>
      Make miracle, miracle, everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earth takes wing<br>
      With birds&#8212;do I care<br>
      Whether of sorrow or joy they sing?<br>
      No; for they make not my life nor destroy!<br>
      My soul awakes<br>
      At a smile that breaks<br>
      In sun; and sunlight is everywhere!

    <h4>

    <p>
      <i>Then dawned a mood of musing thoughtfulness;<br>
      As if he doubted whether he could bless<br>

      Or she remain a vision, as when first<br>

    <h4>
      FOURTH OPAL

    <p>
      We were alone: the perfumed night,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Moonlighted, like a flower<br>
      Grew round us and exhaled delight<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To bless that one sweet hour.

    <p>
      You stood where, 'mid the white and gold,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The rose-fire through the gloom<br>
      Touched hair and cheek and garment's fold<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With soft, ethereal bloom.

    <p>
      And when the vision seemed to swerve,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 'T was but the flickering shine<br>
      That gave new grace, a lovelier curve,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To every dream-like line.
    </p>
    <p>
      O perfect vision! Form and face<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of womanhood complete!<br>
      O rare ideal to embrace<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And hold, from head to feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Could I so hold you ever&#8212;could<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Your eye still catch the glow<br>
      Of mine&#8212;it were an endless good:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Together we should grow
    </p>
    <p>
      One perfect picture of our love!...<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Alas, the embers old<br>
      Fell, and the moonlight fell, above&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Dim, shattered, vapor-cold.

      tomorrow.<br>
       But here at least is what this opal said,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth in number: and the next two bore<br>

    <h4>
      FIFTH OPAL

    <p>
      I dreamed my kisses on your hair<br>
      Turned into roses. Circling bloom<br>
      Crowned the loose-lifted tresses there.<br>
      "O Love," I cried, "forever<br>
      Dwell wreathed, and perfume-haunted<br>
      By my heart's deep honey-breath!"<br>
      But even as I bending looked, I saw<br>
      The roses were not; and, instead, there lay<br>
      Pale, feathered flakes and scentless<br>
      Ashes upon your hair!
    </p>
    <h4>
      SIXTH OPAL

    <p>
      The love I gave, the love I gave,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Wherewith I sought to win you&#8212;<br>
      Ah, long and close to you it clave<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With life and soul and sinew!<br>
      My gentleness with scorn you cursed:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; You knew not what I gave.<br>
      The strongest man may die of thirst:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; My love is in its grave!

    <h4>
      SEVENTH OPAL

    <p>
      You say these jewels were accurst&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With evil omen fraught.<br>
      You should have known it from the first!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; This was the truth they taught:
    </p>
    <p>
      No treasured thing in heaven or earth<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Holds potency more weird<br>
      Than our hearts hold, that throb from birth<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With wavering flames insphered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when from me the gems you took,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; On that strange April day,<br>
      My nature, too, I gave, that shook<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With passion's fateful play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mingled fate my love should give<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In these mute emblems shone,<br>
      That more intensely burn and live&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; While I am turned to stone.

    </p>
    <h4>
      EIGHTH OPAL
    </h4>
    <p>
      I did not know before<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; That we dead could rise and walk;<br>
      That our voices, as of yore,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Would blend in gentle talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know her eyes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Would so haunt mine after death,<br>
      Or that she could hear my sighs,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Low as the harp-string's breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, ah, last night we met!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; From our stilly trance we rose,<br>
      Thrilled with all the old regret&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The grieving that God knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked: "Am I forgiven?"&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "And dost thou forgive?" I said,<br>
      Ah! how long for joy we'd striven!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; But now our hearts were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, for the lips I kissed<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And the sweet hope, long ago!<br>
      On her grave chill hangs the mist;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; On mine, white lies the snow.

    <h4>

    </p>
    <h4>
      NINTH OPAL
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the mountains of Mexico,<br>
      Where the barren volcanoes throw<br>
      Their fierce peaks high to the sky,<br>
      With the strength of a tawny brute<br>
      That sees heaven but to defy,<br>
      And the soft, white hand of the snow<br>
      Touches and makes them mute,&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      Firm in the clasp of the ground<br>
      The opal is found.<br>
      By the struggle of frost and fire<br>
      Created, yet caught in a spell<br>
      From which only human desire<br>
      Can free it, what passion profound<br>
      In its dim, sweet bosom may dwell!
    </p>
    <p>
      So was it with us, I think,<br>
      Whose souls were formed on the brink<br>
      Of a crater, where rain and flame<br>
      Had mingled and crystallized.<br>
      One venturous day Love came;<br>
      Found us; and bound with a link<br>
      Of gold the jewels he prized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agonies old of the earth,<br>
      Its plenitude and its dearth,<br>
      The torrents of flame and of tears,<br>
      All these in our souls were inborn.<br>
      And we must endure through the years<br>
      The glory and burden of birth<br>
      That filled us with fire of the morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the diamond lie in its mine;<br>
      Let ruby and topaz shine;<br>
      The beryl sleep, and the emerald keep<br>
      Its sunned-leaf green! We know<br>
      The joy of sufferings deep<br>
      That blend with a love divine,<br>
      And the hidden warmth of the snow!

      Glow of the daybreak tender,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Flushed with an opaline gleam,<br>
      And passionate sunset-splendor&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Ye both but embody a dream.<br>
      Visions of cloud-hidden glory<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Breaking from sources of light<br>
      Mimic the mist of life's story.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Mingled of scarlet and white.<br>
      Sunset-clouds iridescent,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Opals, and mists of the day,<br>
      Are thrilled alike with the crescent<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Delight of a deathless ray<br>
      Shot through the hesitant trouble<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of particles floating in space,<br>
      And touching each wandering bubble<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With tints of a rainbowed grace.<br>
      So through the veil of emotion<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Trembles the light of the truth;<br>
      And so may the light of devotion<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Glorify life&#8212;age and youth.<br>
      Sufferings,&#8212;pangs that seem cruel,&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; These are but atoms adrift:<br>
      The light streams through, and a jewel<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Is formed for us, Heaven's own gift!

      Save as the sunlight falls<br>
      In dreams of harvest-yellow,<br>
      What voice remembered calls,&#8212;<br>
      So bubbling fresh, so soft and mellow?

    <p>
      A darting, azure-feathered arrow<br>
      From some lithe sapling's bow-curve, fleet<br>
      The bluebird, springing light and narrow,<br>
      Sings in flight, with gurglings sweet:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of the South I wing,<br>
      Blown on the breath of Spring:<br>
      The little faltering song<br>

      Flit, flit, o'er the fertile land<br>
      'Mid hovering insects' hums;<br>
      Fall into the sower's hand:<br>

      The seed and the song shall have flowered together.

      From the Roanoke and Kanawha;<br>
      From the musical Southern rivers,<br>
      O'er the land where the fierce war-wolf<br>
      Lies slain and buried in flowers;<br>
      I come to your chill, sad hours<br>
      And the woods where the sunlight shivers.<br>
      I come like an echo: 'Awake!'<br>
      I answer the sky and the lake<br>
      And the clear, cool color that quivers<br>
      In all your azure rills.<br>
      I come to your wan, bleak hills<br>
      For a greeting that rises dearer,<br>
      To homely hearts draws me nearer<br>
      Than the warmth of the rice-fields or wealth of the ranches.

      That sweeps with its wing the faded meadow<br>
      Not long! And yet thy fleeting,<br>
      Thy tender, flute-toned greeting,<br>
      O bluebird, wakes an answer that remains<br>
      The purest chord in all the year's refrains.

      "O WHOLESOME DEATH"
    </h3>
    <p>
      O wholesome Death, thy sombre funeral-car<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Looms ever dimly on the lengthening way<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of life; while, lengthening still, in sad
      array,<br>
      My deeds in long procession go, that are<br>
      As mourners of the man they helped to mar.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; I see it all in dreams, such as waylay<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The wandering fancy when the solid day<br>
      Has fallen in smoldering ruins, and night's star,<br>
      Aloft there, with its steady point of light<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Mastering the eye, has wrapped the brain in
      sleep.<br>
      Ah, when I die, and planets hold their flight<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Above my grave, still let my spirit keep<br>
      Sometimes its vigil of divine remorse,<br>
      'Midst pity, praise, or blame heaped o'er my corse!

      INCANTATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; When the leaves, by thousands thinned,<br>
      A thousand times have whirled in the wind,<br>
      And the moon, with hollow cheek,<br>
      Staring from her hollow height,<br>
      Consolation seems to seek<br>
      From the dim, reechoing night;<br>
      And the fog-streaks dead and white<br>
      Lie like ghosts of lost delight<br>
      O'er highest earth and lowest sky;<br>
      Then, Autumn, work thy witchery!
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Strew the ground with poppy-seeds,<br>
      And let my bed be hung with weeds,<br>
      Growing gaunt and rank and tall,<br>
      Drooping o'er me like a pall.<br>
      Send thy stealthy, white-eyed mist<br>
      Across my brow to turn and twist<br>
      Fold on fold, and leave me blind<br>
      To all save visions in the mind.<br>
      Then, in the depth of rain-fed streams<br>
      I shall slumber, and in dreams<br>
      Slide through some long glen that burns<br>
      With a crust of blood-red ferns<br>
      And brown-withered wings of brake<br>
      Like a burning lava-lake;&#8212;<br>
      So, urged to fearful, faster flow<br>
      By the awful gasp, "Hahk! hahk!" of the crow,<br>
      Shall pass by many a haunted rood<br>
      Of the nutty, odorous wood;<br>
      Or, where the hemlocks lean and loom,<br>
      Shall fill my heart with bitter gloom;<br>
      Till, lured by light, reflected cloud,<br>
      I burst aloft my watery shroud,<br>
      And upward through the ether sail<br>
      Far above the shrill wind's wail;&#8212;<br>
      But, falling thence, my soul involve<br>
      With the dust dead flowers dissolve;<br>
      And, gliding out at last to sea,<br>
      Lulled to a long tranquillity,<br>
      The perfect poise of seasons keep<br>
      With the tides that rest at neap.<br>
      So must be fulfilled the rite<br>
      That giveth me the dead year's might;<br>
      And at dawn I shall arise<br>
      A spirit, though with human eyes,<br>
      A human form and human face;<br>
      And where'er I go or stay,<br>
      There the summer's perished grace<br>
      Shall be with me, night and day.

       FEBRUARY 6, 1881</b>

    <p>
      Come not again! I dwell with you<br>
      Above the realm of frost and dew,<br>
      Of pain and fire, and growth to death.<br>
      I dwell with you where never breath<br>
      Is drawn, but fragrance vital flows<br>
      From life to life, even as a rose<br>
      Unseen pours sweetness through each vein<br>
      And from the air distills again.<br>
      You are my rose unseen; we live<br>
      Where each to other joy may give<br>
      In ways untold, by means unknown<br>
      And secret as the magnet-stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For which of us, indeed, is dead?<br>
      No more I lean to kiss your head&#8212;<br>
      The gold-red hair so thick upon it;<br>
      Joy feels no more the touch that won it<br>
      When o'er my brow your pearl-cool palm<br>
      In tenderness so childish, calm,<br>
      Crept softly, once. Yet, see, my arm<br>
      Is strong, and still my blood runs warm.<br>
      I still can work, and think and weep.<br>
      But all this show of life I keep<br>
      Is but the shadow of your shine,<br>
      Flicker of your fire, husk of your vine;
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, you are not dead, nor I
    </p>
    <p>
      Who hear your laughter's minstrelsy.<br>
      Among the stars your feet are set;<br>
      Your little feet are dancing yet<br>
      Their rhythmic beat, as when on earth.<br>
      So swift, so slight are death and birth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Come not again, dear child. If thou<br>
      By any chance couldst break that vow<br>
      Of silence at thy last hour made;<br>
      If to this grim life unafraid<br>
      Thou couldst return, and melt the frost<br>
      Wherein thy bright limbs' power was lost;<br>
      Still would I whisper&#8212;since so fair<br>
      This silent comradeship we share&#8212;<br>
      Yes, whisper 'mid the unbidden rain<br>
      Of tears: "Come not, come not again!"

    <p>
      Yes, I was wrong about the phoebe-bird.<br>
      Two songs it has, and both of them I've heard:<br>
      I did not know those strains of joy and sorrow<br>
      Came from one throat, or that each note could borrow<br>
      Strength from the other, making one more brave<br>
      And one as sad as rain-drops on a grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But thus it is. Two songs have men and maidens:<br>
      One is for hey-day, one is sorrow's cadence.<br>
      Our voices vary with the changing seasons<br>
      Of life's long year, for deep and natural reasons.<br>
      Therefore despair not. Think not you have altered,<br>
      If, at some time, the gayer note has faltered.<br>
      We are as God has made us. Gladness, pain,<br>
      Delight and death, and moods of bliss or bane,<br>
      With love and hate, or good and evil&#8212;all,<br>
      At separate times, in separate accents call;<br>
      Yet 't is the same heart-throb within the breast<br>
      That gives an impulse to our worst and best.<br>
      I doubt not when our earthly cries are ended,<br>
      The Listener finds them in one music blended.

    <hr>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Beauty and splendor were on every hand:<br>
      Yet strangely crawled dark shadows down the lanes,<br>
      Twisting across the fields, like dragon-shapes<br>
      That smote the air with blackness, and devoured<br>
      The life of light, and choked the smiling world<br>
      Till it grew livid with a sudden age&#8212;<br>
      The death of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      O squandered happiness;<br>
      Vain dust of misery powdering life's fresh flower!<br>
      The sky was holy, but the earth was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Men ruled, but ruled in vain; since
      wretchedness<br>
      Of soul and body, for the mass of men,<br>
      Made them like dead leaves in an idle drift<br>
      Around the plough of progress as it drove<br>
      Sharp through the glebe of modern days, to plant<br>
      A civilized world. Ay; civilized&#8212;but not Christian!
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Civilization is a clarion voice<br>
      Crying in the wilderness; a prophet-word<br>
      Still unfulfilled. And lo, along the ways<br>
      Crowded with nations, there arose a strife;<br>
      Disturbance of men; tongues contradicting tongues;<br>
      Madness of noise, that scattered multitudes;<br>
      A trample of blind feet, beneath whose tread<br>
      Truth's bloom shrank withered; while incessant mouths<br>
      Howled "Progress! Change!"&#8212;as though all moods of
      change<br>
      Were fiats of truth eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      'Mid the din<br>
      Two pilgrims, faring forward, saw the light<br>
      In a strong city, fortified, and moved<br>
      Patiently thither. "All your steps are vain,"<br>
      Cried scoffers. "There is mercy in the world;<br>
      But chiefly mercy of man to man. For we<br>
      Are good. We help our fellows, when we can.<br>
      Our charity is enormous. Look at these<br>
      Long rolls of rich subscriptions. We are good.<br>
      'T is true, God's mercy plays a part in things;<br>
      But most is left to us; and we judge well.<br>
      Stay with us in the field of endless war!<br>
      Here only is health. Yon city fortified<br>
      You dream of&#8212;why, its ramparts are as dust.<br>
      It gives no safety. One assaulting sweep<br>
      Of our huge cohorts would annul its power&#8212;<br>
      Crush it in atoms; make it meaningless."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrims listened; but onward still they moved.<br>
      They passed the gates; they stood upon a hill<br>
      Enclosed, but in that strong enclosure free!<br>
      Though earth opposed, they held the key to heaven.<br>
      On came the turbulent multitude in war,<br>
      Dashing against the city's walls; and swept<br>
      Through all the streets, and robbed and burned and
      killed.<br>
      The walls were strong; the gates were always open.<br>
      And so the invader rioted, and was proud.<br>
      But sudden, in seeming triumph, the enemy host<br>
      Was stricken with death; and still the city stayed.<br>
      Skyward the souls of its defenders rose,<br>
      Returning soon in mist intangible<br>
      That flashed with radiance of half-hidden swords;<br>
      And those who still assaulted&#8212;though they crept<br>
      Into the inmost vantage-points, with craft&#8212;<br>
      Fell, blasted namelessly by this veiled flash,<br>
      Even as they shouted out, "The place is ours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; So those two pilgrims dwelt there, fortified<br>
      In that strong city men had thought so frail.<br>
      They died, and lived again. Fiercest attack<br>
      Was as a perfumed breeze to them, which drew<br>
      Their souls still closer unto God. And there<br>
      Beauty and splendor bloomed untouched. The stars<br>
      Spoke to them, bidding them be of good cheer,<br>
      Though hostile hordes rushed over them in blood.<br>
      And still the prayers of all that people rose<br>
      As incense mingled with music of their hearts.<br>
      For Christ was with them: angels were their aid.<br>
      What though the enemy used their open gates?<br>
      The children of the citadel conquered all<br>
      Their conquerors, smiting them with the pure light<br>
      That shone in that strong city fortified.

      ARISE, AMERICAN!
    </h3>
    <p>
      The soul of a nation awaking,&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; High visions of daybreak,&#8212;I saw;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A people renewed; the forsaking<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of sin, and the worship
      of law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sing, pine-tree; shout, to the hoarser<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Response of the jubilant sea!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rush, river, foam-flecked like a
      courser;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warn all who are honest
      and free!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our birth-star beckons to trial<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The faith of the far-fled years,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere scorn was our share, and
      denial,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or laughter for
      patriots' tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Faith shall come forth the finer,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; From trampled thickets of fire,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the orient open diviner<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before her, the heaven
      rise higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      O deep, sweet eyes, but severer<br>
      &nbsp; Than steel! See you yet, where he comes&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Our hero? Bend your glance nearer;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak, Faith! For, as wakening drums,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your voice shall set his blood stirring;<br>
      &nbsp; His heart shall grow strong like the main<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; When the rowelled winds are spurring,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the broad tides landward strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      O hero, art thou among us?<br>
      &nbsp; O helper, hidest thou, still?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Why hast thou no anthem sung us,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why workest thou not our will?
    </p>
    <p>
      For a smirk of the face, or a favor,<br>
      &nbsp; Still shelters the cheat where he crawls;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And the truth we began with needs braver<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upholders, and loftier walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too long has the land's soul slumbered<br>
      &nbsp; In wearying dreams of gain,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With prosperous falsity cumbered<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And dulled with bribes, as a bane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, cunning is civilized evil,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And crafty the gold-baited snare;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But virtue, in fiery upheaval,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May cast fine device to
      the air.

    <p>
      Bring us the simple and stalwart<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of earlier days.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come! Far better than all
      were't&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our precepts, our pride,
      and our lays&#8212;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skilled from thy cradle, a

      march?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And what shall be the music of his dirge?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; No single voice may chant the Nation's
      grief,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; No formal strain can give its woe relief.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The pent-up anguish of the loyal wife,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The sobs of those who, nearest in this life,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Still hold him closely in the life
      beyond;&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; These first, with threnody of memories fond.<br>
      But look! Forth press a myriad mourners thronging,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With hearts that throb in sorrow's
      exaltation,<br>
      Moved by a strange, impassioned, hopeless longing<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To serve him with their love's last
      ministration.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Make way! Make way, from wave-bound verge to

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Of all our land, that this great multitude<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With lamentation proud albeit subdued,<br>
      Deep murmuring like the ocean's mighty surge,<br>
      May pass beneath the heavens' triumphal arch!

    <h4>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; What is the sound we hear?<br>
      Never the fall of a tear;<br>
      For grief repressed<br>
      In every breast<br>
      More honors the man we revere.<br>
      Rising from East and West,<br>
      There echoes afar or near&#8212;<br>
      From the cool, sad North and the burning South&#8212;<br>
      A sound long since grown dear,<br>
      When brave ranks faced the cannon's mouth<br>
      And died for a faith austere:<br>
      The tread of marching men,<br>
      A steady tramp of feet<br>
      That never flinched nor faltered when<br>
      The drums of duty beat.<br>
      With sable hats whose shade<br>
      Falls from the cord of gold<br>
      On every time-worn face;<br>
      With tattered flags, in black enrolled,<br>
      Beneath whose folds they warred of old;<br>
      Forward, firmly arrayed,<br>
      With a sombre, martial grace;<br>
      So the Grand Army moves<br>
      Commanded by the dead,<br>
      Following him whose name it loves,<br>
      Whose voice in life its footsteps led.

      Flash of steel and tears forgiving<br>

      Comrades ghostly join the living&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Dreaming, chanting: "All is well."<br>
      They receive the General sleeping,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Him of spirit pure and large:<br>
      Him they draw into their keeping<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Evermore, in faithful charge.

    <p>
      Pass on, O steps, with your dead, sad note!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; For a people's homage is in the sound;<br>
      And the even tread, in measured rote,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; As a leader is laid beneath the ground,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumors the hum of a pilgrim
      train<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shall trample the earth as
      tramples the rain,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeking the door of the hero's

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeking him where he lies low in the
      gloom,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paying him tribute of worker and
      mage,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through age on age!

    <h4>
      V

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Tall pine-tree on McGregor's height,<br>
      How didst thou grow to such a lofty bearing,<br>
      For song of bird or beat of breeze uncaring,<br>
      There where thy shadow touched the dying brow?<br>
      Were all thy sinewy fibres shaped aright?<br>
      Was there no flaw? With what mysterious daring<br>
      Didst thou put forth each murmuring, odorous bough<br>
      And trust it to the frail support of air?<br>
      We only know that thou art now supreme:<br>
      We know not how thou grewest so tall and fair.<br>
      So from the unnoticed, humble earth arose<br>
      The sturdy man whom we, bewailing, deem<br>
      Worthy the wondrous name fame's far voice blows.<br>
      And lo! his ancient foes<br>
      Rise up to praise the plan<br>
      Of modest grandeur, loyal trust,<br>
      And generous power from man to man,<br>
      That lifted him above the formless dust.<br>
      O heart by kindliness betrayed,<br>
      O noble spirit snared and strayed&#8212;<br>
      Unmatched, upright thou standest still<br>
      As that firm pine-tree rooted on the hill!
    </p>
    <h4>
      VI
    </h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; No paragon was he,<br>
      But moulded in the rough<br>
      With every fault and scar<br>
      Ingrained, and plain for all to see:<br>
      Even as the rocks and mountains are,<br>
      Common perhaps, yet wrought of such true stuff<br>
      That common nature in his essence grew<br>
      To something which till then it never knew;<br>
      Ay, common as a vast, refreshing wind<br>
      That sweeps the continent, or as some star<br>
      Which, 'mid a million, shines out well-defined:<br>
      With honest soul on duty bent,<br>
      A servant-soldier, President;<br>
      Meekest when crowned with victory,<br>
      And greatest in adversity!
    </p>
    <h4>
      VII
    </h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; A silent man whom, strangely, fate<br>
      Made doubly silent ere he died,<br>
      His speechless spirit rules us still;<br>
      And that deep spell of influence mute,<br>
      The majesty of dauntless will<br>
      That wielded hosts and saved the State,<br>
      Seems through the mist our spirits yet to thrill.<br>
      His heart is with us! From the root<br>
      Of toil and pain and brave endurance<br>
      Has sprung at last the perfect fruit,<br>
      The treasure of a rich assurance<br>
      That men who nobly work and live<br>
      A greater gift than life may give;<br>
      Yielding a promise for all time,<br>
      Which other men of newer date<br>
      Surely redeem in deeds sublime.<br>
      Forerunner of a valiant race,<br>
      His voiceless spirit still reminds us<br>
      Of ever-waiting, silent duty:<br>
      The bond of faith wherewith he binds us<br>
      Shall hold us ready hour by hour<br>
      To serve the sacred, guiding power<br>
      Whene'er it calls, where'er it finds us,<br>
      With loyalty that, like a folded flower,<br>
      Blooms at a touch in proud, full-circled beauty.
    </p>
    <h4>
      VIII
    </h4>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Like swelling river waves that strain,<br>
      Onward the people crowd<br>
      In serried, billowing train.<br>
      And those so slow to yield,<br>
      On many a hard fought field,<br>
      Muster together<br>
      Like a dark cloud<br>
      In summer weather,<br>
      Whose threatening thunders suddenly are stilled,&#8212;<br>
      And all the world is filled<br>
      With smiling rest. Victory to him was pain,<br>
      Till he had won his enemies by love;<br>
      Had leashed the eagle and unloosed the dove;<br>
      Setting on war's red roll the argent seal of peace.<br>
      So here they form their solid ranks again,<br>
      But in no mood of hatred or disdain.<br>
      They say: "Thou who art fallen at last,<br>
      Beleaguered stealthily, o'ercome by death,<br>
      Thy conqueror now shall be magnanimous<br>
      Even as thou wast to us.<br>
      But not for thee can we blot out the past:<br>
      We would not, if we might, forget thy last<br>
      Great act of war, that with a gentle hand<br>
      Brought back our hearts unto the mighty mother,<br>
      For whose defence and honor armed we stand.<br>
      We hail thee brother,<br>
      And so salute thy name with holy breath!"

      Mark once the mouth that never speaks;<br>
      Think of the man and his quiet manner:<br>
      Weep if you will; then go your way;<br>
      But remember his face as it looks to the skies,<br>
      And the dumb appeal wherewith it seeks<br>
      To lead us on, as one should say, "Arise&#8212;<br>
      Go forth to meet your country's noblest day!"

      Clangor of bugle and flashing of sabre,<br>

      KEENAN'S CHARGE

    <h4>
      I
    </h4>
    <p>
      The sun had set;<br>
      The leaves with dew were wet:<br>
      Down fell a bloody dusk<br>
      On the woods, that second of May,<br>
      Where Stonewall's corps, like a beast of prey,<br>
      Tore through, with angry tusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've trapped us, boys!"&#8212;<br>
      Rose from our flank a voice.<br>
      With a rush of steel and smoke<br>
      On came the rebels straight,<br>
      Eager as love and wild as hate;<br>
      And our line reeled and broke;
    </p>
    <p>
      Broke and fled.<br>
      No one stayed&#8212;but the dead!<br>
      With curses, shrieks, and cries,<br>
      Horses and wagons and men<br>
      Tumbled back through the shuddering glen,<br>
      And above us the fading skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's one hope, still&#8212;<br>
      Those batteries parked on the hill!<br>
      "Battery, wheel!" ('mid the roar)<br>
      "Pass pieces; fix prolonge to fire<br>
      Retiring. Trot!" In the panic dire<br>
      A bugle rings "Trot"&#8212;and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses plunged,<br>
      The cannon lurched and lunged,<br>
      To join the hopeless rout.<br>
      But suddenly rode a form<br>
      Calmly in front of the human storm,<br>
      With a stern, commanding shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Align those guns!"<br>
      (We knew it was Pleasonton's.)<br>
      The cannoneers bent to obey,<br>
      And worked with a will at his word:<br>
      And the black guns moved as if <i>they</i> had heard.<br>
      But ah, the dread delay!
    </p>
    <p>
      "To wait is crime;<br>
      O God, for ten minutes' time!"<br>
      The General looked around.<br>
      There Keenan sat, like a stone,<br>
      With his three hundred horse alone,<br>
      Less shaken than the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Major, your men?"<br>
      "Are soldiers, General." "Then,<br>
      Charge, Major! Do your best:<br>
      Hold the enemy back, at all cost,<br>
      Till my guns are placed;&#8212;else the army is lost.<br>
      You die to save the rest!"
    </p>
    <h4>
      II
    </h4>
    <p>
      By the shrouded gleam of the western skies,<br>
      Brave Keenan looked into Pleasonton's eyes<br>
      For an instant&#8212;clear, and cool, and still;<br>
      Then, with a smile, he said: "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cavalry, charge!" Not a man of them shrank.<br>
      Their sharp, full cheer, from rank on rank,<br>
      Rose joyously, with a willing breath&#8212;-<br>
      Rose like a greeting hail to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then forward they sprang, and spurred and clashed;<br>
      Shouted the officers, crimson-sash'd;<br>
      Rode well the men, each brave as his fellow,<br>
      In their faded coats of the blue and yellow;<br>
      And above in the air, with an instinct true,<br>
      Like a bird of war their pennon flew.
    </p>
    <p>
      With clank of scabbards and thunder of steeds,<br>
      And blades that shine like sunlit reeds,<br>
      And strong brown faces bravely pale<br>
      For fear their proud attempt shall fail,<br>
      Three hundred Pennsylvanians close<br>
      On twice ten thousand gallant foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Line after line the troopers came<br>
      To the edge of the wood that was ring'd with flame;<br>
      Rode in and sabred and shot&#8212;and fell;<br>
      Nor came one back his wounds to tell.<br>
      And full in the midst rose Keenan, tall,<br>
      In the gloom like a martyr awaiting his fall,<br>
      While the circle-stroke of his sabre, swung<br>
      'Round his head, like a halo there, luminous hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Line after line, aye, whole platoons,<br>
      Struck dead in their saddles, of brave dragoons<br>
      By the maddened horses were onward borne<br>
      And into the vortex flung, trampled and torn;<br>
      As Keenan fought with his men, side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they rode, till there were no more to ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      But over them, lying there shattered and mute,<br>
      What deep echo rolls?&#8212;'T is a death-salute,<br>
      From the cannon in place; for heroes, you braved<br>
      Your fate not in vain: the army was saved!
    </p>
    <p>
      Over them now&#8212;year following year&#8212;<br>
      Over their graves the pine-cones fall,<br>
      And the whip-poor-will chants his spectre-call;<br>
      But they stir not again: they raise no cheer:<br>
      They have ceased. But their glory shall never cease,<br>
      Nor their light be quenched in the light of peace.<br>
      The rush of their charge is resounding still<br>
      That saved the army at Chancellorsville.

    <h3>
      MARTHY VIRGINIA'S HAND
    </h3>
    <p>
      "There, on the left!" said the colonel: the battle<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; had shuddered and faded away,<br>
      Wraith of a fiery enchantment that left only<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; ashes and blood-sprinkled clay&#8212;<br>
      "Ride to the left and examine that ridge, where<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; the enemy's sharpshooters stood.<br>
      Lord, how they picked off our men, from the<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; treacherous vantage-ground of the wood!<br>
      But for their bullets, I'll bet, my batteries sent<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; them something as good.<br>
      Go and explore, and report to me then, and tell<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; me how many we killed.<br>
      Never a wink shall I sleep till I know our vengeance<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; was duly fulfilled."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiercely the orderly rode down the slope of the<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; corn-field&#8212;scarred and forlorn,<br>
      Rutted by violent wheels, and scathed by the<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; shot that had plowed it in scorn;<br>
      Fiercely, and burning with wrath for the sight<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; of his comrades crushed at a blow,<br>
      Flung in broken shapes on the ground like<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; ruined memorials of woe:<br>
      These were the men whom at daybreak he knew,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; but never again could know.<br>
      Thence to the ridge, where roots outthrust, and<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; twisted branches of trees<br>
      Clutched the hill like clawing lions, firm their<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; prey to seize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your report?"&#8212;and the grim colonel<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; smiled when the orderly came back at last.<br>
      Strangely the soldier paused: "Well, they were<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; punished." And strange his face, aghast.<br>
      "Yes, our fire told on them; knocked over fifty&#8212;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; laid out in line of parade.<br>
      Brave fellows, colonel, to stay as they did! But<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; one I 'most wish had n't stayed.<br>
      Mortally wounded, he'd torn off his knapsack;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; and then at the end he prayed&#8212;<br>
      Easy to see, by his hands that were clasped;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; and the dull, dead fingers yet held<br>
      This little letter&#8212;his wife's&#8212;from the
      knapsack.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; A pity those woods were shelled!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent the orderly, watching with tears in his eyes<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; as his officer scanned<br>
      Four short pages of writing. "What's this, about<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Marthy Virginia's hand'?"<br>
      Swift from his honeymoon he, the dead soldier,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; had gone from his bride to the strife;<br>
      Never they met again, but she had written him,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; telling of that new life,<br>
      Born in the daughter, that bound her still closer<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; and closer to him as his wife.<br>
      Laying her baby's hand down on the letter,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; around it she traced a rude line;<br>
      "If you would kiss the baby," she wrote, "you<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; must kiss this outline of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the shape of the hand on the page,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; with the small, chubby fingers outspread.<br>
      "Marthy Virginia's hand, for her pa,"&#8212;so the<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; words on the little palm said.<br>
      Never a wink slept the colonel that night, for<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; the vengeance so blindly fulfilled;<br>
      Never again woke the old battle-glow when the<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; bullets their death-note shrilled.<br>
      Long ago ended the struggle, in union of<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; brotherhood happily stilled;<br>
      Yet from that field of Antietam, in warning and<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; token of love's command,<br>
      See! there is lifted the hand of a baby&#8212;Marthy<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia's hand!

      Once more the sun deploys his rays:<br>
      Third in the trilogy of battle-days<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The awful Friday comes:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A day of dread,<br>
      That should have moved with slow, averted head<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And muffled feet,<br>
      Knowing what streams of pure blood shed,<br>
      What broken hearts and wounded lives must meet<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Its pitiless tread.<br>
      At dawn, like monster mastiffs baying,<br>
      Federal cannon, with a din affraying,<br>
      Roused the old Stonewall brigade,<br>
      That, eagerly and undismayed,<br>
      Charged amain, to be repelled<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; After four hours' bitter fighting,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Forth and back, with bayonets biting;<br>
      Where in after years, the wood&#8212;<br>
      Flayed and bullet-riddled&#8212;stood<br>
      A presence ghostly, grim and stark,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With trees all withered, wasted, gray,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The place of combat night and day<br>
      Like marshaled skeletons to mark.<br>
      Anon, a lull: the troops are spelled.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sound of guns or drums<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disturbs the air.<br>
      Only the insect-chorus faintly hums,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Chirping around the patient, sleepless dead<br>
      Scattered, or fallen in heaps all wildly spread;<br>
      Forgotten fragments left in hurried flight;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Forms that, a few hours since, were human
      creatures,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now blasted of their features,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or stamped with blank despair;<br>
      Or with dumb faces smiling as for gladness,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though stricken by utter blight<br>
      Of motionless, inert, and hopeless sadness.<br>
      Fear you the naked horrors of a war?<br>
      Then cherish peace, and take up arms no more.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For, if you fight, you must<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold your brothers' dust<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unpityingly ground down<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And mixed with blood and powder,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; To write the annals of renown<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metal loaded with metal in tons,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Massed by Lee, send out their shock.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, with a movement
      magnificent,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pickett, the golden-haired
      leader,<br>
      Thousands and thousands flings onward, as if he sent<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merely a meek interceder.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Steadily sure his division advances,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Gay as the light on its weapons that dances.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agonized screams of the shell<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doom that it carries
      foretell:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Rifle-balls whistle, like sea-birds singing;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Limbs are severed, and souls set winging;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet Pickett's warriors never
      waver.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Show me in all the world anything braver<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Than the bold sweep of his fearless
      battalions,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three half-miles over ground
      unsheltered<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to the cannon, where regiments
      weltered<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Prone in the batteries' blast that raked<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Swaths of men and, flame-tongued, drank<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Their blood with eager thirst unslaked.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armistead, Kemper, and Pettigrew<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Rush on the Union men, rank against rank,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Planting their battle-flags high on the
      crest.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Pause not the soldiers, nor dream they of
      rest,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Till they fall with their enemy's guns at the
      breast<br>
      And the shriek in their ears of the wounded artillery
      stallions.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Pickett charged, a man
      indued<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; With knightly power to lead a multitude<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And bring to fame the scarred surviving few.

      Triumphant Union, soon to be restored,<br>

      NOTES
    </h2>
    <p>
      [1] <a href="#I.9"><i>Bride Brook</i></a>.&#8212;The colony
      of New London (now part of Connecticut) was founded by John
      Winthrop, Jr., under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. One
      of the boundary lines was a stream flowing into Long Island
      Sound, between the present city of New London and the
      Connecticut River. In the snowy winter of 1646, Jonathan
      Rudd, who dwelt in the settlement of Saybrook Fort, at the
      mouth of the Connecticut, sent for Winthrop to celebrate a
      marriage between himself and a certain "Mary" of Saybrook,
      whose last name has been lost. Winthrop performed the
      ceremony on the frozen surface of the streamlet, the farthest
      limit of his magistracy; and thereupon bestowed the name
      "Bride Brook," which it still bears.
    </p>
    <p>
      [2] <a href="#II.1"><i>The Bride of War</i></a>.&#8212;Jemima
      Warner, a Pennsylvania woman, was the wife of one of Morgan's
      riflemen. She marched with the expedition; and, when her
      husband perished of cold and exhaustion, she took his rifle
      and equipments and herself carried them to Quebec, where she
      delivered them to Arnold as a token of her husband's
      sacrifice, and proof that he was not a deserter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Enos of Connecticut abandoned the column while it was
      struggling through the Dead River region, with his whole
      force, the rear-guard, numbering eight hundred men. But for
      this defection Arnold might have triumphed in his assault on
      Quebec. It is a curious circumstance that, with this traitor
      at the rear, and with Benedict Arnold at its head, the little
      army also counted in its ranks Aaron Burr, whose treason was
      to ripen after the war ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      [3] <a href="#III.2"><i>The Sword Dham</i></a>.&#8212;Antar,
      the Bedouin poet-hero, was chief of the tribe of Ghaylib.
    </p>
    <p>
      [4] <a href="#V.2"><i>The Name of
      Washington</i></a>.&#8212;Read before the Sons of the
      Revolution, New-York, February 22, 1887, and adopted as the
      poem of the Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      [5] <a href="#V.6"><i>Marthy Virginia's
      Hand</i></a>.&#8212;This was an actual incident in the
      experience of the late Colonel (formerly Captain) Albert J.
      Munroe. of the Third Rhode Island Artillery, a gallant
      officer, gentle and brave as well in peace as in war.
    </p>
    <p>
      [6] <a href="#V.7"><i>Gettysburg: A Battle
      Ode</i></a>.&#8212;Written for the Society of the Army of the
      Potomac, and read at its re-union with Confederate survivors
      on the field of Gettysburg, July 3, 1888, the Twenty-Fifth
      Anniversary of the Battle.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement

LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
