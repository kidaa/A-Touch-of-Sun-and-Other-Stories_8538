Book 60 1 Peter
001:001 Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ:  To God's own people
        scattered over the earth, who are living as foreigners
        in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Roman Asia, and Bithynia,
001:002 chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father,
        through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, with a view
        to their obedience and to their being sprinkled with the blood
        of Jesus Christ.  May more and more grace and peace be
        granted to you.
001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        who in His great mercy has begotten us anew to an ever-living
        hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
001:004 to an inheritance imperishable, undefiled and unfading,
        which has been reserved in Heaven for you,
001:005 whom God in His power is guarding through faith for a salvation
        that even now stands ready for unveiling at the End of the Age.
001:006 Rejoice triumphantly in the prospect of this, even if now,
        for a short time, you are compelled to sorrow amid various trials.
001:007 The sorrow comes in order that the testing of your faith--
        being more precious than that of gold, which perishes and yet
        is proved by fire--may be found to result in praise and glory
        and honour at the re-appearing of Jesus Christ.
001:008 Him you love, though your eyes have never looked on Him.
        In Him, though at present you cannot see Him, you nevertheless
        trust, and triumph with a joy which is unspeakable and is
        crowned with glory,
001:009 while you are securing as the outcome of your faith the salvation
        of your souls.
001:010 There were Prophets who earnestly inquired about that salvation,
        and closely searched into it--even those who spoke beforehand
        of the grace which was to come to you.
001:011 They were eager to know the time which the Spirit of Christ within
        them kept indicating, or the characteristics of that time,
        when they solemnly made known beforehand the sufferings that
        were to come upon Christ and the glories which would follow.
001:012 To them it was revealed that they were serving not themselves but you,
        when they foretold the very things which have now been openly
        declared to you by those who, having been taught by the Holy Spirit
        which had been sent from Heaven, brought you the Good News.
        Angels long to stoop and look into these things.
001:013 Therefore gird up your minds and fix your hopes calmly
        and unfalteringly upon the boon that is soon to be yours,
        at the re-appearing of Jesus Christ.
001:014 And, since you delight in obedience, do not shape your lives
        by the cravings which used to dominate you in the time
        of your ignorance,
001:015 but--in imitation of the holy One who has called you--
        you also must be holy in all your habits of life.
001:016 Because it stands written, "You are to be holy, because I am holy."
001:017 And if you address as your Father Him who judges impartially
        in accordance with each man's actions, then spend in fear
        the time of your stay here on earth,
001:018 knowing, as you do, that it was not with a ransom of
        perishable wealth, such as silver or gold, that you were set
        free from your frivolous habits of life which had been handed
        down to you from your forefathers,
001:019 but with the precious blood of Christ--as of an unblemished
        and spotless lamb.
001:020 He was pre-destined indeed to this work, even before the creation
        of the world, but has been plainly manifested in these last
        days for the sake of you who, through Him,
001:021 are faithful to God, who raised Him from among the dead and gave
        Him glory, so that your faith and hope are resting upon God.
001:022 Now that, through your obedience to the truth, you have
        purified your souls for cherishing sincere brotherly love,
        you must love another heartily and fervently.
001:023 For you have been begotten again by God's ever-living and enduring
        word from a germ not of perishable, but of imperishable life.
001:024 "All mankind resemble the herbage, and all their beauty is like
        its flowers.  The herbage dries up, and its flowers drop off;
001:025 But the word of the Lord remains for ever."  And that means
        the Message which has been proclaimed among you in the Good News.
002:001 Rid yourselves therefore of all ill-will and all deceitfulness,
        of insincerity and envy, and of all evil speaking.
002:002 Thirst, like newly-born infants, for pure milk for the soul,
        that by it you may grow up to salvation;
002:003 if you have had any experience of the goodness of the Lord.
002:004 Come to Him, the ever-living Stone, rejected indeed by men
        as worthless, but in God's esteem chosen and held in honour.
002:005 And be yourselves also like living stones that are being built
        up into a spiritual house, to become a holy priesthood to offer
        spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
002:006 For it is contained in Scripture, "See, I am placing on Mount Zion
        a Cornerstone, chosen, and held in honour, and he whose faith
        rests on Him shall never have reason to feel ashamed."
002:007 To you believers, therefore, that honour belongs; but for
        unbelievers--"A Stone which the builders rejected has been
        made the Cornerstone,"
002:008 and "a Stone for the foot to strike against, and a Rock to
        stumble over."  Their foot strikes against it because they are
        disobedient to God's Message, and to this they were appointed.
002:009 But you are a chosen race, a priesthood of kingly lineage,
        a holy nation, a people belonging specially to God,
        that you may make known the perfections of Him who called
        you out of darkness into His marvellous light.
002:010 Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
        Once you had not found mercy, but now you have.
002:011 Dear friends, I entreat you as pilgrims and foreigners
        not to indulge the cravings of your lower natures:
        for all such cravings wage war upon the soul.
002:012 Live honourable lives among the Gentiles, in order that,
        although they now speak against you as evil-doers, they may
        yet witness your good conduct, and may glorify God on the day
        of reward and retribution.
002:013 Submit, for the Lord's sake, to every authority set up by man,
        whether it be to the Emperor as supreme ruler,
002:014 or to provincial Governors as sent by him for the punishment
        of evil-doers and the encouragement of those who do what is right.
002:015 For it is God's will that by doing what is right you should
        thus silence the ignorant talk of foolish persons.
002:016 Be free men, and yet do not make your freedom an excuse
        for base conduct, but be God's bondservants.
002:017 Honour every one.  Love the brotherhood, fear God,
        honour the Emperor.
002:018 Household servants, be submissive to your masters, and show them
        the utmost respect--not only if they are kind and thoughtful,
        but also if they are unreasonable.
002:019 For it is an acceptable thing with God, if, from a sense of duty
        to Him, a man patiently submits to wrong, when treated unjustly.
002:020 If you do wrong and receive a blow for it, what credit is there
        in your bearing it patiently?  But if when you do right and
        suffer for it you bear it patiently, this is an acceptable
        thing with God.
002:021 And it is to this you were called; because Christ also suffered
        on your behalf, leaving you an example so that you should
        follow in His steps.
002:022 He never sinned, and no deceitful language was ever heard
        from His mouth.
002:023 When He was reviled, He did not answer with reviling;
        when He suffered He uttered no threats, but left His wrongs
        in the hands of the righteous Judge.
002:024 The burden of our sins He Himself carried in His own body
        to the Cross and bore it there, so that we, having died
        so far as our sins are concerned, may live righteous lives.
        By His wounds yours have been healed.
002:025 For you were straying like lost sheep, but now you have come
        back to the Shepherd and Protector of your souls.
003:001 Married women, in the same way, be submissive to your husbands,
        so that even if some of them disbelieve the Message, they may,
        apart from the Message, be won over by the daily life
        of their wives, after watching your daily life--
003:002 so full of reverence, and so blameless!
003:003 Your adornment ought not to be a merely outward thing--one of plaiting
        the hair, putting on jewelry, or wearing beautiful dresses.
003:004 Instead of that, it should be a new nature within--
        the imperishable ornament of a gentle and peaceful spirit,
        which is indeed precious in the sight of God.
003:005 For in ancient times also this was the way the holy women
        who set their hopes upon God used to adorn themselves,
        being submissive to their husbands.
003:006 Thus, for instance, Sarah obeyed Abraham, acknowledging his
        authority over her.  And you have become Sarah's children if you
        do what is right and permit nothing whatever to terrify you.
003:007 Married men, in the same way, live with your wives with a clear
        recognition of the fact that they are weaker than you.
        Yet, since you are heirs with them of God's free gift of Life,
        treat them with honour; so that your prayers may not be hindered.
003:008 In conclusion, all of you should be of one mind, quick to sympathize,
        kind to the brethren, tenderhearted, lowly-minded,
003:009 not requiting evil with evil nor abuse with abuse, but,
        on the contrary, giving a blessing in return, because a blessing
        is what you have been called by God to inherit.
003:010 For "He who wishes to be well-satisfied with life and see
        happy days--let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his
        lips from deceitful words;
003:011 Let him turn from evil, and do good; Let him inquire for peace
        and go in pursuit of it.
003:012 For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears
        are open to their supplication; but the face of the Lord
        is set against evil-doers."
003:013 And who will be able to harm you, if you show yourselves
        zealous for that which is good?
003:014 But even if you suffer for righteousness' sake, you are to be envied.
        So do not be alarmed by their threats, nor troubled;
003:015 but in your hearts consecrate Christ as Lord, being always ready
        to make your defence to any one who asks from you a reason
        for the hope which you cherish.
003:016 Yet argue modestly and cautiously, keeping your consciences
        free from guilt, so that, when you are spoken against,
        those who slander your good Christian lives may be put to shame.
003:017 For it is better that you should suffer for doing right,
        if such be God's will, than for doing evil;
003:018 because Christ also once for all died for sins, the innocent
        One for the guilty many, in order to bring us to God.
        He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,
003:019 in which He also went and proclaimed His Message to the spirits
        that were in prison,
003:020 who in ancient times had been disobedient, while God's
        longsuffering was patiently waiting in the days of Noah
        during the building of the Ark, in which a few persons--
        eight in number--were brought safely through the water.
003:021 And, corresponding to that figure, the water of baptism now saves you--
        not the washing off of material defilement, but the craving
        of a good conscience after God--through the resurrection
        of Jesus Christ,
003:022 who is at God's right hand, having gone into Heaven, angels and
        authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.
004:001 Since, then, Christ has suffered in the flesh, you also must
        arm yourselves with a determination to do the same--
        because he who has suffered in the flesh has done with sin--
004:002 that in future you may spend the rest of your earthly lives,
        governed not by human passions, but by the will of God.
004:003 For you have given time enough in the past to the doing of
        the things which the Gentiles delight in--pursuing, as you did,
        a course of habitual licence, debauchery, hard drinking,
        noisy revelry, drunkenness and unholy image-worship.
004:004 At this they are astonished--that you do not run into the same
        excess of profligacy as they do; and they speak abusively of you.
004:005 But they will have to give account to Him who stands ready
        to pronounce judgement on the living and the dead.
004:006 For it is with this end in view that the Good News was
        proclaimed even to some who were dead, that they may be judged,
        as all mankind will be judged, in the body, but may be living
        a godly life in the spirit.
004:007 But the end of all things is now close at hand:
        therefore be sober-minded and temperate, so that you may give
        yourselves to prayer.
004:008 Above all continue to love one another fervently, for love
        throws a veil over a multitude of faults.
004:009 Extend ungrudging hospitality towards one another.
004:010 Whatever be the gifts which each has received, you must
        use them for one another's benefit, as good stewards of
        God's many-sided kindness.
004:011 If any one preaches, let it be as uttering God's truth;
        if any one renders a service to others, let it be in the strength
        which God supplies; so that in everything glory may be given
        to God in the name of Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory
        and the might to the Ages of the Ages.  Amen.
004:012 Dear friends, do not be surprised at finding that that scorching
        flame of persecution is raging among you to put you to the test--
        as though some surprising thing were accidentally happening to you.
004:013 On the contrary, in the degree that you share in the sufferings
        of the Christ, rejoice, so that at the unveiling of His glory
        you may also rejoice with triumphant gladness.
004:014 You are to be envied, if you are being reproached for bearing
        the name of Christ; for in that case the Spirit of glory--
        even the Spirit of God--is resting upon you.
004:015 But let not one of you suffer as a murderer or a thief
        or an evil-doer, or as a spy upon other people's business.
004:016 If, however, any one suffers because he is a Christian,
        let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God for being
        permitted to bear that name.
004:017 For the time has come for judgement to begin, and to begin
        at the house of God; and if it begins with us, what will be
        the end of those who reject God's Good News?
004:018 And if it is difficult even for a righteous man to be saved,
        what will become of irreligious men and sinners?
004:019 Therefore also, let those who are suffering in accordance
        with the will of God entrust their souls in well-doing
        to a faithful Creator.
005:001 So I exhort the Elders among you--I who am their fellow Elder
        and have been an eye-witness of the sufferings of the Christ,
        and am also a sharer in the glory which is soon to be revealed.
005:002 Be shepherds of God's flock which is among you.
        Exercise the oversight not reluctantly but eagerly,
        in accordance with the will of God; not for base gain but
        with cheerful minds;
005:003 not lording it over your Churches but proving yourselves
        patterns for the flock to imitate.
005:004 And then, when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive
        the never-withering wreath of glory.
005:005 In the same way you younger men must submit to your elders;
        and all of you must gird yourselves with humility towards
        one another, for God sets Himself against the proud,
        but gives grace to the humble.
005:006 Humble yourselves therefore beneath the mighty hand of God,
        so that at the right time He may set you on high.
005:007 Throw the whole of your anxiety upon Him, because He Himself
        cares for you.
005:008 Curb every passion, and be on the alert.  Your great accuser,
        the Devil, is going about like a roaring lion to see whom
        he can devour.
005:009 Withstand him, firm in your faith; knowing that your brethren
        in other parts of the world are passing through just
        the same experiences.
005:010 And God, the giver of all grace, who has called you to share His
        eternal glory, through Christ, after you have suffered for a
        short time, will Himself make you perfect, firm, and strong.
005:011 To Him be all power unto the Ages of the Ages!  Amen.
005:012 I send this short letter by Silas, our faithful brother--
        for such I regard him--in order to encourage you, and to bear
        witness that what I have told you is the true grace of God.
        In it stand fast.
005:013 The Church in Babylon, chosen like yourselves by God,
        sends greetings, and so does Mark my son.
005:014 Greet one another with a kiss of love.  Peace be with all of you
        who are in Christ.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
