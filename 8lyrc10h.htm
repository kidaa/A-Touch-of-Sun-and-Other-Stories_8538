      the death of the authoress, and in fulfilment of her last

    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      I would gaze down the vista of past years,<br>
       In fancy see to-night,<br>
       A loved one passed from sight,<br>
       But whose blest memory my spirit cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shrined in the sacred temple of my soul,<br>
       He seems again to live,<br>
       And fond affection give,<br>
       His mother's heart comfort and console.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perception of the beautiful and bright,<br>
       In nature and in art,<br>
       Evolved from his true heart<br>
       Perpetual beams like sunshine's cheering light.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple unsophisticated life,<br>
       With faith in action strong,<br>
       And perseverance long,<br>
       Made all he did with vigorous purpose rife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Responsive to sweet sympathy's kind claim,<br>
       His quick impulsive heart<br>
       Loved to take active part<br>
       In mirthful joy or sorrowing grief and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manly face would glow with honest glee.<br>
       As with parental pride,<br>
       Which he ne'er sought to hide,<br>
       He fondly gazed on his loved family.
    </p>
    <p>
      For them he crowned with industry his days;<br>
       Ever they were to him<br>
       The sweetest, holiest hymn<br>
       Of his heart's jubilant, exultant praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Oh, the tender pity of his eye.<br>
       The gentle touch and word,<br>
       When his fond heart was stirred<br>
       To practical display of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His true affection, manners gently gay,<br>
       The kiss that seems e'en now<br>
       Warm on my lips and brow,<br>
       Are memories that ne'er can pass away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naught can e'er lessen the fond hope that we<br>
       May, one day, meet above<br>
       With all we dearly love,<br>
       To live again in blissful unity.

      BIRDIES. FOR A LITTLE FIVE YEAR OLD.
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      A tender birdie mother sat<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In her soft nest one day,<br>
       Teaching her little fledglings, three,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To gambol, sing, and play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear little brood, the mother said,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis time for you to fly<br>
       From branch to branch, from tree to tree,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And see the bright blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chirrup, the eldest, quick replied,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; O yes, sweet mother mine,<br>
       We'll be so glad to hop about,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And see the bright sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twitter and Downy also said,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; We, too, shall happy be,<br>
       To bask within the sun's warm rays,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And swing on branch and tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, the mother said, you shall,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And straight the birdies all,<br>
       Perched on the edge of the high nest,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the chestnuts tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, said the mother bird,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; You must not go beyond<br>
       That row of trees that skirt the edge<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of the transparent pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      For if you do you might get lost,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Or drowned, and die in pain,<br>
       And never to our dear home nest<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Return in joy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well mind your orders, mother dear,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And will not disagree,<br>
       But do just what you tell us now,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Said all the birdies three.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hopped off on delighted wing,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To the next chestnut tree,<br>
       O'erjoyed and panting with delight,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The great, grand world to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! what a bright, glad scene, they cried,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And what a wond'rous sky!<br>
       What joy 'twould be to kiss the Sun,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And be with him on high.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I, said Downy, I should like<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To sail on yonder sea,<br>
       And with that pretty milk-white bird,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Skim o'er the waters free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Twitter, you talk very large,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And do not seem to know<br>
       Our little wings have not yet power<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond these trees to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, said Chirrup, mother said<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; We must not go beyond,<br>
       But only hop and fly about<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The trees that skirt the pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      But mother's gone to get us food,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And she will never know,<br>
       Said Downy, so upon the pond<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; I am resolved to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      O fie! exclaimed the birdies both,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To think of such a thing,<br>
       You might get harm, and on us all<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Sorrow and trouble bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I am not a bit afraid,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; I feel so strong and free,<br>
       And will not homeward go until<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; I float on yonder sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, well, said both the other two,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; We will not go with you,<br>
       Good-bye, we will not disobey<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Our mother kind and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off went the two obedient birds,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And safely reached their nest,<br>
       The little birdies' happy home<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of sweet delight and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, poor naughty Downy flew<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; From off the chestnut tree,<br>
       Away towards the milk-white bird<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; That skimmed the waters free.
    </p>
    <p>
      But ah! his wings were much too weak<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To bear him all the way,<br>
       And Downy fell imploring aid<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; From loved ones far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no help came. The mother bird<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was far off gathering food,<br>
       From perfumed clover meadows round,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; For her beloved brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when she reached her nest and found<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; But two birds there alone,<br>
       And heard that Downy to the pond<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; So wilfully had flown,
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart, so lately full of joy,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was rent with grief and pain,<br>
       For fear lest she should never see<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Her darling bird again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling upon his name she flew,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In terror, far and near,<br>
       From tree to pond, from pond to tree,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Seeking her birdie dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She called; alas, no answer came<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To that poor mother's cry,<br>
       She searched among the sweet, wild flowers,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And chestnut branches high.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she spied a tiny speck<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the waters clear,<br>
       It was, alas, the lifeless form<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of her lost Downy dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew him on the soft green grass,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And chafed his lifeless form,<br>
       Opened his glassy eyes and mouth,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And tried his limbs to warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all in vain, her darling bird<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was dead, and nevermore<br>
       Would he into that mother's ear,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; His pretty warblings pour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in despair she buried him<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the chestnut tree,<br>
       And covered him with twigs and leaves,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; While weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with torn and sorrowing heart,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; She flew back to her home,<br>
       Where Twit and Chirrup trembling staid,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Disconsolate and lone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My little birdie dears, she said,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In bitterness and pain,<br>
       Our darling Downy to his nest<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Will never come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wilful disobedience<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To my direct commands,<br>
       Has brought its own dire punishment,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Such as all sin demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I could have trusted him,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; For he, as you well know,<br>
       Promised me very faithfully<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Not from these trees to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want you both, my birdies dear,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To learn from this to see<br>
       How lying disobedience<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Will ever punished be.
    </p>
    <p>
      So take a lesson from it, dears,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And be resolved that you<br>
       Will never disobey or lie,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever else you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      O yes, we'll try our very best,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Your orders to obey,<br>
       And always strive to tell the truth,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Whether at work or play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear children who may hear this tale,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; You, too, should also try<br>
       To do whatever you are told,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And never tell a lie.

      THE ANGEL ON WAR.
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      An angel spirit winging<br>
       Through aerial space her flight,<br>
       O'er peaceful, sleep-bound nature<br>
       Thus sang one autumn night:<br>
       What are those hosts advancing<br>
       In legions o'er the plain,<br>
       Through orchards heavy laden<br>
       And fields of full-eared grain?
    </p>
    <p>
      Eastward and westward come they<br>
       Shining like gems of light,<br>
       Beneath soft, silvery moonbeams<br>
       Of peaceful, silent night.<br>
       Surely assembled nations<br>
       Are gathering for a f&ecirc;te<br>
       Of tournament, sham fight or joist,<br>
       In pride of strength elate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, may be, some grand meeting<br>
       On field of cloth of gold,<br>
       Attracts those swarming legions<br>
       A peaceful tryst to hold;<br>
       For see, the steeds caparisoned<br>
       In trappings rich and bright,<br>
       With noble, high-bred men astride,<br>
       In transports of delight!
    </p>
    <p>
      The flower of German fatherland,<br>
       In manhood's strength and pride,<br>
       Press on in measured marching,<br>
       By grey-haired veterans' side,<br>
       And westward press the youth of France,<br>
       Whose ardour none can stay,<br>
       Thirsting for laurels in the tilts<br>
       And contests of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emperors, with marshals, generals,<br>
       And stalwart men, are there;<br>
       Flushed with excitement swift they come<br>
       The splendid sports to share,<br>
       Doubtless each wears the colours<br>
       Of some loved lady fair<br>
       Whom they predict shall one day<br>
       Their heart and fortunes share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now sable night droops kindly<br>
       Into the arms of morn,<br>
       Who comes to herald in the day<br>
       And nature's face adorn?<br>
       Heaven's soft grey eastern portals<br>
       For her wide open fly,<br>
       As the grand sun's golden chariot<br>
       Wheels proudly through the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night's gentle Queen and star gems<br>
       Withdraw their gracious sway,<br>
       As the sun in rose-hued splendour<br>
       Kisses to life the day.<br>
       Waters like polished silver<br>
       Dotting the plain like shields,<br>
       Babble their morning greeting<br>
       From golden, grain-crowned fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the glad light of morning<br>
       Trips joyful o'er the plain,<br>
       As the angel horror stricken<br>
       Takes up her strain again,<br>
       Alas! those hosts advancing<br>
       In hot haste from afar,<br>
       But yesternight so joyous,<br>
       Now close in bloody war.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as ferocious tigers,<br>
       On tasting human blood,<br>
       Revel in greedy madness<br>
       Amid the crimson flood,<br>
       So these fierce hostile warriors,<br>
       Now stained with human gore,<br>
       Grow unrestrained and reckless,<br>
       And fiercer than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley late so peaceful<br>
       Steams with the rage of strife,<br>
       Fast down the gloated furrows<br>
       Flows the red stream of life.<br>
       Maddened to rage and fury,<br>
       Th' opposing hosts contend,<br>
       And murder, ruin, carnage, death,<br>
       Through the gorged plains extend.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can be, cried the angel,<br>
       The meaning of such strife,<br>
       And how dare man thus rashly<br>
       Trifle with human life?<br>
       Can all the so-called glory,<br>
       That man to man can pay,<br>
       Outweigh the dire inheritance<br>
       Of this unhallowed fray?
    </p>
    <p>
      Are hearts thus drunk with life blood,<br>
       And hands thus steeped in gore,<br>
       Not calculated to become<br>
       More brutal than before?<br>
       And do not youth and manhood<br>
       Deserve a better fate,<br>
       Than to be rashly sacrificed<br>
       To jealous greed and hate?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of glittering lances<br>
       Cut through the startled air,<br>
       As valiant chiefs and mighty men<br>
       The blood-red carnage share.<br>
       Flashes, like sunlight splendour,<br>
       Gleam forth from brazen shields,<br>
       And burnished arms dart back the light,<br>
       O'er the blood-gorged fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      List! said the angel, sighing,<br>
       From many a ghastly mound<br>
       Deep groans of torture mingle<br>
       With the battle din around.<br>
       What piteous cries of anguish<br>
       Are those, who dying moan,<br>
       That they may never more behold<br>
       Their dearly loved at home!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of earth's best and brightest,<br>
       'Mid prospects glad and gay,<br>
       Others to loved ones plighted<br>
       Slaughtered and bleeding lay!<br>
       Some, sons of widowed mothers<br>
       Who had none else to cheer,<br>
       Some, guardians of fond sisters,<br>
       Many to wives most dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! who can tell the sorrow<br>
       Intailed by war's foul breath,<br>
       Or gauge the dire inheritance<br>
       Of all this murderous death!<br>
       The sinew of their country,<br>
       The hope of years to come,<br>
       Cut down in prime of manhood,<br>
       Buried in stranger tomb!
    </p>
    <p>
      O sages, statesmen, rulers,<br>
       Bestir yourselves and teach<br>
       The nation's misled millions<br>
       A higher goal to reach;<br>
       Exchange for greed and murder,<br>
       A reign of peace divine;<br>
       Thus, elevate earth's children<br>
       To brotherhood sublime!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus spake the gentle angel<br>
       As, gathering each fond prayer,<br>
       She wreathed them into garlands,<br>
       Of flowerets rich and rare<br>
       For Sardanapolis to plant,<br>
       Where they shall ever bloom,<br>
       In the eternal gardens<br>
       Beyond the silent tomb.

       <i>Late Medical Officer of Health for West Kent, and
      formerly of Birkenhead</i>.<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
       DIED DECEMBER 12TH, 1884.</b>
    </center>
    <p class="dropverse">
      Broken the silver cord! the harp unstrung!<br>
       And kindred hearts with grief and anguish wrung,<br>
       For a beloved one from the earth hath flown<br>
       Leaving his dear ones desolate and lone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheerless, deserted now each empty place,<br>
       So lately filled by him with radiant grace;<br>
       Sad memories in each lone corner dwell,<br>
       Vocal of him our torn hearts loved so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      To feelings sympathetic and refined,<br>
       He joined a well-stored, richly cultured mind,<br>
       Where holy reason held her peerless sway,<br>
       Dictating all he had to do and say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-discipline in action, thought and deed,<br>
       Was his uncompromising, glorious creed;<br>
       To do to others as he would that they<br>
       Should do to him, his crystal rule each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark superstition never gained his ear,<br>
       Or led to slavish and debasing fear;<br>
       A hater of hypocrisy in all<br>
       The varied forms by which it doth enthrall.
    </p>
    <p>
      His logical and comprehensive mind,<br>
       Was marvellously gentle, loving, kind,<br>
       Which gave him with his patients wonderous power,<br>
       And served them well in many a trying hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of penetration, forethought, tact,<br>
       Loving to solve, elucidate each fact;<br>
       He firmly held to truth with friend and foe,<br>
       And ne'er was known to act from greed or show.
    </p>
    <p>
      A safe and trusted counsellor was he,<br>
       And helpful, sweet companion as could be,<br>
       Of such calm, chastened thought, that all he said<br>
       Was fraught with wisdom, and by justice led.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sense of duty formed the crucial test<br>
       By which to rule his actions, work and rest.<br>
       And his well-regulated heart and mind<br>
       Were full of charity towards all mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A zealous public worker in the cause<br>
       Of sanitation, based on nature's laws;<br>
       For fifteen years in Birkenhead and Kent,<br>
       To this great end he his rare knowledge lent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved his work and duties, as some love<br>
       Their pleasures, and with earnest purpose strove,<br>
       To prove that each right action surely brought<br>
       Its blessing, as all evil misery wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entheal concord, where 'twas possible,<br>
       And truth and justice made it feasible,<br>
       The armour his peace-loving spirit wore,<br>
       The love-crowned banner which aloft he bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful in nature and in art,<br>
       Charmed and delighted his devoted heart,<br>
       A gorgeous sunset, and a moonlit sky,<br>
       Ne'er failed to captivate both mind and eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      As circlets made by weights flung in the deep,<br>
       Clear multiplying forms concentric keep,<br>
       Obedient to the heavenly law sublime,<br>
       Each circle forming others through all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So our beloved one leaves his track behind,<br>
       Of multiplying circles to his kind,<br>
       In the rich lessons of his well-spent life,<br>
       With holy God-like teachings ever rife.
    </p>
    <p>
      No storied marble setting forth his praise,<br>
       A more enduring monument could raise,<br>
       Than the productive seed which he has sown,<br>
       Which chants his requiem in undying tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A priceless heritage he leaves behind,<br>
       In the example of his well-trained mind,<br>
       A blessed Aftermath! God grant that we<br>
       May tune our hearts to its sweet melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      For though the jewel casket be no more<br>
       Amongst us, as in happier days of yore,<br>
       The radiance of the gem it held will still<br>
       Remain our lonely home and hearts to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us then try courageously to tread,<br>
       The footprints where his noble teachings led,<br>
       With self-denying zeal right onward go,<br>
       Striving to vanquish every inward foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus we'll hope to meet again once more<br>
       Unitedly with loved ones gone before,<br>
       In the divine hereafter-home above,<br>
       Safe in each other's and the Father's love.

      A lovely, happy, peaceful home,<br>

      The Susquehanna's limpid flow,<br>

      Like a radiant gleam of sunshine<br>

      THE SHAKER GIRL
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      I met a pleasant, thoughtful girl,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh from a homely band<br>
       Of Shaker brethren who fare well<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In this far Western land.<br>
       I talked to her of earthly love,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; She answered with a sigh;<br>
       I sought to know the hidden truth,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And asked the reason why<br>
       She would prefer a Shaker's life,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Pleasant though it might be,<br>
       To working in the free, grand world,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Consistently and free,<br>
       With household duties wooing her,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And babies on her knee?<br>
       She blushed a trifle, and looked shy,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Confessed the truth was plain,<br>
       That if "some one" should ever come<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And seek her love again,<br>
       She would, with all her loving heart,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Accept his profferred hand,<br>
       And leave her Shaker friends with him,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; For any clime or land;<br>
       But that she doubted that the love<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; He once professed was o'er,<br>
       And that she feared that it for her<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was quenched for evermore;<br>
       And so she guessed she'd best return<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To her calm Shaker home,<br>
       And curb the feelings of her heart,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And never seek to roam.<br>
       O Shaker maiden, pause, I pray,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Take further earnest thought,<br>
       Nor stay the longings of your heart,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With heaven-born nature fraught<br>
       Duties there are on every side,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Awaiting willing hands,<br>
       All unrestricted, unconfined<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; By any creeds or lands.<br>
       Sweet ties of home are holier far,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Spontaneous acts more true,<br>
       Than any Shaker work ordained<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; For man to struggle through.

      THE FABLE OF THE SPHYNX
    </h2>
    <center>
      <i>Facts gathered from a lecture by George Chainey, of
      Boston, U.S.</i><br>
       &nbsp;
    </center>
    <p class="dropverse">
      Oh! the image and the fable of the Sphynx!<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What lessons do they teach,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sermons do they preach<br>
       Of the riddle and the mystery of life!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis a union of brute force and love sublime.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A female face and head<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a lioness form are wed,<br>
       Embodying strength and purity divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lioness, a symbol of wild might;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peerless head and face,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bust of female grace,<br>
       Are types of pure affection and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each one lies this dual element:<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonine cruelty,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That well might master be,<br>
       If not o'er-ruled by strict fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the all-powerful conquering light of love,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Which, blessing those who give<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; No less than who receive,<br>
       Makes bliss on earth, as God's laws clearly prove.
    </p>
    <p>
      In crowning thus the Sphynx with love's sweet worth,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have for us the old,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet gospel ever told<br>
       That love in peerless might should rule the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall then our path o'er life's uncertain way<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be led by a true heart,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting pure love's kind part,<br>
       Or by fierce guidance of a beast of prey?
    </p>
    <p>
      To what heroic heights mortals may climb,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humanity to serve,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With loving heart and nerve,<br>
       Are seen in Buddha, and in Florence Nightingale.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to what depths of leonine lust and crime<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cruel man may go,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scattering fear, ruin, woe,<br>
       Witness fierce Nero and Caligula!
    </p>
    <p>
      In each these possible heights and depths betide,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All, then, may freely choose,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None can the choice refuse,<br>
       Between the higher and the lower guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where selfishness and unchecked passions stray<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As ruling motives sole,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reach a tinselled goal,<br>
       There crouches the ferocious beast of prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall life to us be crowned with blessings sure,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noblest woman's life,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harmonious 'mid all strife,<br>
       Or blurred with bestial appetites impure?
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the answer should be prompt and plain,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we, at any cost,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will not be so far lost<br>
       As to permit the beast o'er love to reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purport of the dual female form,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrines the grand truth, that
      Might<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should bravely nourish Right,<br>
       Life's checkered pathway sweetly to adorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis said the Sphynx in ancient Afric' stood<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the great highway,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beckoning all to stay,<br>
       Who passed, to guess life's riddle if they could,
    </p>
    <p>
      Which if they failed in, she devoured them there,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she believed that they<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would not learn life's way,<br>
       Were not entitled its best joys to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Oedipus, a wiser man than most<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing, the riddle guessed,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That gave the Sphynx sweet
      rest,<br>
       And forthwith she descended from her post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing her secret, once devined, would be<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learned by all thinkers, then<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proclaimed by them to men,<br>
       Her mission o'er, she vanished 'neath the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The axiom of "Man, know thyself" is worth<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pains it costs to learn,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E'en through long labours
      stern,<br>
       Since 'tis the key that opes rich joys on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pure knowledge entereth through struggles fierce,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And only to the few<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sternly seek the true,<br>
       Is given to solve the mystery of the Sphynx.

      LOVE.
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      Immortal love! what power is thine,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To quicken and inspire!<br>
       Fabled Prometheus well might dare<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To steal from heaven such fire.<br>
       For 'tis a beacon light to guide<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To rapturous joy and peace,<br>
       In this our present earthly home,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And where all sorrows cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy subtle fire electrical,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In word, look, touch or kiss,<br>
       Thrills through our being to invoke<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Responsive mutual bliss.<br>
       Once moved by this Herculean power,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; What cannot mortals dare?<br>
       Dangers else insurmountable,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; They with impressment share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing on earth e'er nerved the arm<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of knight or warrior bold,<br>
       Like love of country, home, and heaven,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In the brave days of old.<br>
       No matter what man's form of words,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Uttered or written down,<br>
       If thy incisive, quickening spell,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Does not their labour crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still thou reign'st supremely fair,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In homes and battle fields,<br>
       And his the arm victorious,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Who thy grand armour wields.<br>
       For they who with untiring zeal,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Thy heart-fires ceaseless feed,<br>
       Know their supernal warmth alone,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Can meet man's highest need.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hearts e'en at the altar pledged<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Oft seek for love in vain,<br>
       And hungering souls are doomed to starve,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In freezing, cold disdain.<br>
       Ah, why should mortals thus refuse<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To wield that grace divine,<br>
       The chief of the blest three that heaven<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Gives to make life sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some make a grave mistake, and seek<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Pity beyond their home;<br>
       No friend or relative on earth<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Should counsel thus to roam.<br>
       Others have cultivated minds,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Are leaders in high art,<br>
       Whilst in the little things of life,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; They take no kindly part.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet if we investigate,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; It is these little things,<br>
       Which make up human happiness,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And lasting pleasure brings.<br>
       And tastes objectionable oft,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; May on life's harp-strings jar,<br>
       Producing irritation<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And much domestic war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little word in the right place,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The gentle touches, tones,<br>
       The watchful loving sympathy,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Which for so much atones,<br>
       Are potent means which moral force<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Finds it the best to wield,<br>
       For 'neath their mystic influence,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Most hearts are bound to yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! for this love that conquers self,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; That binds us to our kind,<br>
       That raises us to heaven and God,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And purifies the mind!<br>
       Ecstatic, sweet, rekindling power,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Bright altar-fire sublime,<br>
       Most precious gift to mortals given,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; That will outlive all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rubicon is past when wed,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And there is no retreat,<br>
       Brave hearts should then accept the lot,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Which none but they can meet.<br>
       'Tis always wise and safe to choose<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The heaven directed course<br>
       Of ruling by all-conquering love,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Than by the rod of force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let home be made a sacred shrine,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The best, most cherished spot,<br>
       All others then will surely be<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Deserted and forgot.<br>
       Each should uphold the other self,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Before the world's keen sight;<br>
       In thus upholding, each will keep<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; His honour doubly bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Graecian vestals who of yore<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Believed no duty higher<br>
       Than tending night and day the flame<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of the celestial fire,<br>
       So let the broad world's denizens<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Foster this heart-fire bright,<br>
       Which can their pilgrimage on earth<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Illume with glorious light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Domestic bliss, how beautiful!<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; No idol is so fair.<br>
       Set in the royalty of love,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; What can with it compare?<br>
       Models of virtue are the homes<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Where this blest power holds sway,<br>
       Where parents' words suffice to move<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their offspring to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know of such a happy home,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Where love-signs rarely cease,<br>
       And 'tis in very truth a throne<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of harmony and peace.<br>
       Nature's grand law of order there,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Reigns with exactness sure<br>
       The wheels of time glide smoothly through<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; An atmosphere so pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of healthy children six<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their happy parents meet,<br>
       For breakfast where food, simple, pure,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their hungry senses greet.<br>
       Those budding blossoms of the home<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With joy-lit life appear,<br>
       A daily morning glory they,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; So neat, clean, trim and dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder if the father's soul,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Worships his darling bride,<br>
       No wonder if his manly heart,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Swells with delighted pride:<br>
       For does she not make home a shrine,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Where love and duty vie<br>
       To honour, through her peerless love,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their holy marriage tie?
    </p>
    <p>
      He daily leaves his happy home,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Next heaven the holiest place,<br>
       Strengthened by her sweet words and kiss,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; For action in life's race.<br>
       And she through all her daily rounds,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Thinks foremost of the one,<br>
       Who no less now than years ago,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Her steadfast love has won.
    </p>
    <p>
      God bless them in their happy home!<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; God bless their children nine!<br>
       And may they through a peaceful life,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Ever in love combine,<br>
       To aid and cheer each other here,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And when this life is past,<br>
       Be reunited in that life<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Which will for ever last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such homes of cheerful industry,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of order, thrift and care,<br>
       Sweetly reflect on those whose minds,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their thrice blest precincts share.<br>
       And since 'tis in the reach of most<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To make a home like this.<br>
       What pity that e'en one refuse<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To win such priceless bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      People there are who ceaseless moan,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their hard and cruel fate,<br>
       Yet never see their course is wrong,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Until alas! too late;<br>
       To such the axiom I'd repeat,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; That 'tis God's righteous will,<br>
       To help all those who help themselves,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Life's duties to fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis written upon every life<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With which we mingle here,<br>
       And throughout nature's wide domain<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; It also doth appear,<br>
       That all unchanging are God's laws,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their consequences sure;<br>
       That as we choose to sow we reap,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Fruit holy or impure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trace the effects of idleness,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Extravagance and play,<br>
       Of self-indulgence, vice and pride,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And then reflecting say,<br>
       It was not stern Nemesis' part,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To punish each, as cause<br>
       Of retribution to himself<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; For breaking nature's laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let all, then, bravely conquer self,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And use the means which heaven<br>
       Has placed within the reach of each,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Life's sorriest state to leaven.<br>
       Industry, perseverance, thrift,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Love, honesty and skill,<br>
       Will aid the weakest in their work,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Life's duties to fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      All-conquering, grand, unselfish love!<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Nought can withstand the power<br>
       Of thy divine, o'ermastering force,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To man heaven's richest dower.<br>
       All know who own thy sovereign sway,<br>

      TO THE EMPRESS EUGENIE ON THE DEATH OF HER SON.

    <p class="dropverse">
      If sympathy can soften a mourner's poignant woe,<br>
       And stay the bitter tear drops that from her sad eyes
      flow,<br>
       Then take it, honoured Empress, from the land of thy
      retreat,<br>
       Where hearts in bitter anguish with thine now sorrowing
      beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, we cannot fathom the mysteries of doom,<br>
       Which set its mark upon a life brilliant in youthful
      bloom,<br>
       Full of undaunted ardour, and eager for that strife<br>
       That robbed the sorrowing mother of his most precious life.

       With bounding heart hope-laden and holy ardour fraught,<br>
       Scorning all fear and danger, as by thy wisdom taught.

      fold,<br>
       Crowned with a victor's chaplet within the gates of
      gold,<br>
       His young, bright, earnest spirit happy on yonder shore,<br>
       Where you will be in God's own time united evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crown of earthly splendour might have enwreathed his
      brow,<br>
       But could that weigh 'gainst glory with which 'tis radiant
      now?<br>
       Would'st thou exchange the latter for all earth's gaud and
      glare?<br>
       No, sad one, thou would'st rather in God's time join him
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from all warring tumult, in peaceful joy above,<br>
       Safe in the tender keeping of everlasting love;<br>
       Think of him thus for ever in the dear Father's care,<br>
       And say would'st thou recall him, earth's proudest throne to
      share?
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few swift time-strokes to make up life's brief
      day,<br>
       Only some few more pulse-beats till we, too, pass away;<br>

      Since quite a boy Hal Gradient had been<br>
       Noted for ingenuity&mdash;between<br>
       The hours when not on active duty he<br>
       Immersed in some new scheme was sure to be;<br>
       So, by the age of twenty-five he grew<br>
       Absorbed in plans, constructive, rare and new.<br>
       We both in engineering works were then,<br>
       On contract work engaged in France, when<br>
       He the gratifying news received,<br>
       That some unknown rich relative had died,<br>
       Leaving him sole executor and heir<br>
       To an estate both lucrative and fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to leaving for his native land,<br>
       He said to me, Now, Mark, my friend, you understand,<br>
       I shall expect to see you at my home<br>
       As soon as your engagement here is done;<br>
       And such a home, my boy, as you shall see,<br>
       You cannot well conceive what it may be,<br>
       For I intend to exercise my skill,<br>
       Its precincts with inventions new to fill,<br>
       And have things so arranged that work and time<br>
       Shall reap rich harvests in their course sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed; my contract done, I hastened home,<br>
       Unwilling longer from its joys to roam,<br>
       When Harry, hearing that I had returned,<br>
       To have me by him with impatience burned;<br>
       So, to his pressing lines that I should pay<br>
       A visit to his country home next day,<br>
       I cordially assented, for I, too,<br>
       Was anxious our prized friendship to renew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending at the station I espied<br>
       The dear old boy, with dog-cart at his side,<br>
       Waiting to welcome me with heart and hand,<br>
       To all we prize most in our native land;<br>
       For howsoe'er or wheresoe'er we roam,<br>
       We find no joys like those of home, sweet home!
    </p>
    <p>
      We bowled along the pleasant country lanes,<br>
       By wooded heights and blossom-covered plains.<br>
       See! said he, there's my house among the trees,<br>
       Sheltered, yet open to the southern breeze.<br>
       In that beyond, with other two, you see,<br>
       Whose grounds close round my own so pleasantly,<br>
       Live valued friends of whom I never tire;<br>
       With each abode a telegraphic wire<br>
       Communicates, so, when we feel inclined<br>
       For whist or billiards, after we have dined<br>
       We telegraph to fix the time and place,<br>
       And oft arrange a meet for hunt and chase,<br>
       Which is convenient, as you soon will see,<br>
       And makes us like one social family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then arriving at the gate hard by,<br>
       I will descend and open it, said I;<br>
       Sit still, said Harry, when without a word,<br>
       The gate seemed opened of its own accord.<br>
       Hallo, that's "open, Sesame," I said,<br>
       How is it done? to which Hal answer made:<br>
       Why, don't you see; I've placed across the path<br>
       A narrow gutter like a shallow bath,<br>
       And when we stop the wheels press on it, so<br>
       It slightly sinks, and forces cranks to go,<br>
       These then force back the gate until we've passed,<br>
       Whilst others set it free and close it fast.<br>
       Well, now that is convenient, I cried,<br>
       Yes, and saves lodge and keeper, he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the house, the groom we found<br>
       And waitress at the door, for the clear sound<br>
       From two electric wires pressed by the cart<br>
       In passing through the gate, had sent a dart<br>
       Of electricity that rang a bell,<br>
       To man and maid of our approach to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hal's sister met us in the entrance hall,<br>
       A lady of a certain age, erect and tall,<br>
       Whose bearing was, to say the least, severe,<br>
       One not just suited hearts to win and cheer;<br>
       She eyed me in a curious sort of way,<br>
       And then, with haughty mien, she went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed as I hung up coat and hat,<br>
       A sort of cage, and said to Hal, what's that?<br>
       'Tis my automaton machine, he said,<br>
       For brushing thoroughly from heels to head;<br>
       I will explain: a platform there below<br>
       On which you step, makes wheels and levers go,<br>
       In fact, your weight the motive power supplies,<br>
       On which the action of the whole relies,<br>
       Those arms with brushes then revolving wheel,<br>
       And from your clothes the dust adroitly steal,<br>
       Whilst overhead another like machine<br>
       Is also placed your hat to smooth and clean;<br>
       Observe it, like a hat box cleft in twain,<br>
       With bristled, lever-working jaws that claim<br>
       Your hat within their grasp, so for the nonce<br>
       You've trowsers, coat and hat all brushed at once.<br>
       A very curious contrivance; how<br>
       I'd like to see it set in action now.<br>
       That you shall do, said he, and stepping in<br>
       Upon the little platform neat and trim,<br>
       The numerous brushes vigorously spun<br>
       Some fifteen times, and then their work was done.<br>
       There, shouted Harry, what d'ye think of that?<br>
       Jump in and try, but don't forget your hat,<br>
       For if you do you'll bitterly repent,<br>
       And have good reason, too, for discontent.<br>
       No, not just now, some other day, said I,<br>
       Feeling a bit too nervous then to try.<br>
       Excuse me, then, a moment while I seek<br>
       My sister, for to her I wish to speak.<br>
       Hal had no sooner left, than as I stood<br>
       Before the strange machine, I thought I would<br>
       Venture to test it then when none were by<br>
       To chaff if I should chance to bolt or cry,<br>
       So, stepping boldly in, the brushes ran,<br>
       And their appointed active work began,<br>
       And that they did it well there is no doubt,<br>
       But having rashly bent one elbow out,<br>
       Its funny bone was rapped, which made me shout,<br>
       Then, horrors! the hat brushes wheeled about,<br>
       I had forgot my hat, so they instead<br>
       Most unceremoniously seized my head!<br>
       The horrid thing whirled round at frightful pace,<br>
       Stripping, it seemed, all skin off nose and face.<br>
       I tried to stoop, escape from it to find,<br>
       But only got distracting blows behind,<br>
       Soothing the part affected not the less;<br>
       I felt abused, insulted, I confess.<br>
       The hateful thing, however, stopped at last,<br>
       And springing to the floor I cast<br>
       Bewildered and distrustful glances round<br>
       When, like an added insult, there I found<br>
       Harry convulsed with laughter at my side,<br>
       Which nettled my already wounded pride.<br>
       My anger was extreme on rushing out<br>
       With one loved whisker curled my ear about,<br>
       The other brushed across my face; my hair<br>
       All twisted in a vortex of despair;<br>
       I felt unable to express my rage<br>
       At his so vaunted but abusive cage.<br>
       'Tis an infernal, demon-formed machine,<br>
       Shrieked I to Hal, as ever yet was seen,<br>
       He only roared with laughter as he sat,<br>
       Saying, 'twas so because you had no hat,<br>
       You know I charged you to remember that.<br>
       I tried to laugh but 'twas of little use<br>
       After such diabolical abuse,<br>
       But calming down at last I cheerful rose,<br>
       Wishful, in private, to survey my nose,<br>
       To see if any skin were left there now,<br>
       And what the state of my disordered brow.<br>
       So, hastening to my room with Hal, I found<br>
       All there so cosily arranged around,<br>
       That in my admiration I forgot<br>
       The consequences of my ill-starred lot<br>
       Why, what a jolly room, to him I said<br>
       Yes, and you see that second little bed.<br>
       If you are nervous, or should like me to,<br>
       As when in France, I'll sleep in it by you.<br>
       O no, in England I can have no fear,<br>
       As in the old times when you were not near.<br>
       All right, old boy, but stay, before I go<br>
       I'll light the gas, and I must let you know<br>
       'Tis done by electricity, through aid<br>
       Of batteries in the basement; I've wires laid<br>
       All through the house&mdash;now see this knob I touch<br>
       Causes two wires in contact swift to rush,<br>
       Then an electro magnet turns the stop,<br>
       At the same moment sparks from out them hop,<br>
       The gas is thus ignited&mdash;'tis not all,<br>
       You see along the ceiling, down that wall,<br>
       On either side the gas jet placed, a bar.<br>
       Each of a different metal, one has far<br>
       More power than has the other to expand<br>
       When hot, which makes it bend, you understand,<br>
       In doing so it acts upon a rod<br>
       And lever, under whose constraining nod<br>
       A catch which holds the shutters is set free,<br>
       And with a spring they close to instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metal, as he touched it, heated grew,<br>
       And, as by magic, shutters were closed to.<br>
       'Tis very cleverly arranged, I say,<br>
       But here's a knob marked with the letter A;<br>
       What is its use? This A stands for alarm,<br>
       When pressed in case of fire or threatened harm,<br>
       A large alarum placed above the roof,<br>
       Soon to the neighbours gives convincing proof;<br>
       We won't try that just now as its sound, would<br>
       Undoubtedly alarm the neighbourhood.<br>
       But see, in this recess with curtained way<br>
       Is a self-acting shower-bath that you may<br>
       Try in the morning if you're so inclined.<br>
       There's just one more contrivance yet I find<br>
       That I must show you; by your bed side stands<br>
       A nest of speaking tubes; this one commands<br>
       My bedroom, number two, my sister's, and<br>
       The third, Jane's room; this last, you understand,<br>
       Might be convenient should you e'er require,<br>
       If ill, an early cup of tea, or fire.<br>
       Is Jane the pretty housemaid? I reply,<br>
       She is, you sly boy, but she's coy and shy.<br>
       Harry, I thought you'd known me better to&mdash;&mdash;<br>
       All right, old boy, I was but joking you.<br>
       Harry now left. When dressed for dinner I<br>
       Resolved tube numbered one at once to try,<br>
       I blew the whistle, from the other end<br>
       Hallo, was quickly answered by my friend.<br>
       I'm waiting to go down, will you be long?<br>
       I'm ready now, came mellowly along,<br>
       And so we met upon the landing soon,<br>
       And joined the ladies in the drawing-room.<br>
       A charming little dinner o'er, and then<br>
       The ladies left and we were chatting when<br>
       A bell was rung; Hallo, that's Pool, Hal cried;<br>
       What does he want, I wonder, quick replied<br>
       His friend by numerous clicks. He wants to know<br>
       If we will sup with him. Mark, will you go?<br>
       I've no objection; click, click, click soon sent<br>
       The answer to his friend, and off we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our return Hal showed me many more<br>
       Of his inventions, of which he'd a store,<br>
       Till my bewildered and distracted head<br>
       Was fairly dazed, so I escaped to bed,<br>
       But not, alas, to sleep; th' exciting day<br>
       Had been too much for my poor nerves; I lay<br>
       Tossing and restless, could not sleep at all,<br>
       So thought I'd summon Harry to my call,<br>
       As he'd suggested, and we had agreed<br>
       That I should do in case of urgent need.<br>
       I seized the tube, blew through it lustily.<br>
       Well, soon was answered through it sleepily.<br>
       I cannot get to sleep, I wish you'd come<br>
       To me, or have me with you in your room;<br>
       I'd rather of the two that you'd come here,<br>
       As you proposed, in case of need or fear.<br>
       As I proposed! you base, abandoned wretch,<br>
       Repeat those words and I'll my brother fetch.<br>
       Horror of horrors! the wrong tube I'd grasped,<br>
       And to Miss Gradient had been talking fast.<br>
       What should I do? I tried, but all in vain,<br>
       Th' unlucky error meekly to explain.<br>
       Dear madame, I assure you on my word,<br>
       'Twas a mistake, but no response was heard;<br>
       'Twas clear she'd hear no more I had to say,<br>
       However I might for forgiveness pray,<br>
       So, putting in the whistle, on the bed<br>
       I once more settled my distracted head.<br>
       The bare idea of my speaking so<br>
       To that old lady was an awful blow;<br>
       How could I meet her at the breakfast? how<br>
       Sustain the anger of that rigid brow?<br>
       At last I made a desperate resolve<br>
       To wake up Hal, the mystery to solve,<br>
       So, quickly seizing the next tube o'erhead,<br>
       Oh! I have made a great mistake, I said,<br>
       I wanted you to come and sleep by me,<br>
       But, seizing the wrong tube, unluckily<br>
       I asked Miss Gradient to come instead<br>
       Of you; pray come to me at once, I said,<br>
       Or I shall try to find you, quickly too;<br>
       I'm dying something to explain to you.<br>
       The answer almost drove me wild with pain,<br>
       'Twas in a quick, sharp, female voice again,<br>
       But not Miss Gradient's evidently now,<br>
       'Twas Jane's, the pretty housemaid's: how&mdash;<br>
       How dare you, Sir! I'd have you know, young man,<br>
       That I'm an honest girl, and scorn your plan,<br>
       And if you dare to come you can't get in,<br>
       For cook has double locked the door within.<br>
       My dear girl, I assure you, I commenced&mdash;<br>
       I ain't your dear girl, then said Jane, incensed,<br>
       'Tis no use talking any more to-night,<br>
       With curl papers I'll stop the plug up tight,<br>
       And in the morning, to your cost, you'll see<br>
       I will expose your conduct thoroughly.<br>
       Another awful error&mdash;what a scrape<br>
       I found myself within, and how escape?<br>
       I threw myself once more upon the bed,<br>
       Great drops of perspiration on my head,<br>
       Feeling bewildered, destitute of hope,<br>
       With such a series of mishaps to cope.<br>
       If those fast bolted shutters had not been<br>
       So firmly closed, I might have had a gleam<br>
       Of the blest early dawn, but I <i>will</i> try,<br>
       Thought I, to open them; then by and bye<br>
       I'll dress and go to Harry to explain,<br>
       Before he meets his sister or sees Jane.<br>
       I felt my way then cautiously along,<br>
       Quite nervous, lest I should again go wrong.<br>
       The window was a bow one&mdash;on I passed,<br>
       Still groping onward, till I cried at last,<br>
       Ah! here it is, this is the curtain slide;<br>
       I passed within, when&mdash;how shall I describe<br>
       My woeful plight? I screamed and yelled with pain,<br>
       My feelings to describe, alas! 'twere vain,<br>
       In the self-acting shower bath I had stepped.<br>
       And in a torrent its freed waters leapt<br>
       On my distracted form, with deafening sound,<br>
       Which sent me stunned and spinning to the ground<br>
       In painful and undignified surprise;<br>
       The curtains having deadened the wild cries,<br>
       Wrung from me under such enforced surprise,<br>
       No one had been aware of my sad plight.<br>
       As dripping, shivering with the sudden fright,<br>
       I drew my wet clothes off and felt my way<br>
       For dry ones, longing for the light of day,<br>
       As longs some sun-struck traveller, from whose sight<br>
       A momentary shock obscures the light.<br>
       The darkness so oppressive and intense<br>
       Seemed round me an impenetrable fence,<br>
       As well to physical as mental view,<br>
       Deadening the intellect and reason too.<br>
       I could not long the awful state endure,<br>
       So making a great effort to secure<br>
       A calmer mood, by sad experience taught,<br>
       Why, what a fool I've been, at length I thought,<br>
       To have forgotten like an arrant dunce<br>
       I've but to press the knob to have at once<br>
       The gas jet lit; so groping bit by bit,<br>
       I reached it, pushed the knob, but no gas lit;<br>
       Terrific noise above I heard instead,<br>
       I'd set th' alarum crashing overhead!<br>
       What should I do? the neighbourhood would be<br>
       Aroused, and perhaps as terrified as me.<br>
       I'd no idea how to stop the thing<br>
       Which now distractingly began to ring.<br>
       I'd rush to Harry; ah, he'd heard the crash,<br>
       And to my room now rushed with hurried dash;<br>
       Why, what on earth's the matter, quickly tell?<br>
       Nothing but that abominable bell.<br>
       I wished to light the gas, the wrong knob pushed;<br>
       There, Harry said, I've stopped it, and off rushed<br>
       To satisfy the neighbours who were now<br>
       Ringing t' inquire th' occasion of the row.<br>
       He soon returned, saying he'd telegraphed<br>
       To tell of the mistake, and then he laughed,<br>
       Lighted my gas, and quickly went to bed,<br>
       As he, like me, was chilled from heels to head.<br>
       Alas! my friend was gone ere I'd the power<br>
       T' explain the <i>contretemps</i> of that sad hour.<br>
       To get away was now my only thought,<br>
       But then this all-important step was fraught<br>
       With seen and unseen dangers everywhere,<br>
       Suppose I met Miss Gradient on the stair,<br>
       Or Jane&mdash;for this I candidly confess<br>
       I did not the required aplomb possess.<br>
       Besides I dreaded now to rouse the house;<br>
       No, I would dress, then wait, still as a mouse,<br>
       For early dawn, a note to Harry write,<br>
       Which would my wronged position soon make right.<br>
       Yes, I would go before the servants were,<br>
       Or any of the family, astir.<br>
       Consulting Bradshaw, then, I found a train<br>
       Arranged to leave at six&mdash;could I but gain<br>
       The station by that hour, how happy I<br>
       Should be. I soon resolved to try.<br>
       I dressed at once, my letter with sad heart<br>
       Placed on the table, and prepared to start.<br>
       Opening the door I crept out cautiously,<br>
       With boots in hand down stairs quite noiselessly;<br>
       Arriving in the hall I put them on,<br>
       But found the front door locked and the key gone!<br>
       Confound it! what on earth was I to do?<br>
       I'd try the kitchen entrance to get through;<br>
       Steering in that direction, on I went,<br>
       To find some egress resolutely bent;<br>
       Coming to baize-clad folding doors at length,<br>
       I turned the handle, pushed with all my strength.<br>
       Then, Murder! Thieves! and Fire! I shouted loud,<br>
       For tightly clasped in writhing pain I bowed<br>
       Within the thief trap, where I had been caught,<br>
       Which Harry had explained, but I'd forgot;<br>
       The sharp, excruciating agony,<br>
       From the electric current, cruelly<br>
       Vibrated through me from my head to feet,<br>
       Urging the goaded blood to fever heat.<br>
       At last the cruel knocks and shaking ceased,<br>
       And from the horrid thing I got released;<br>
       I dropped bewildered on a chair hard by,<br>
       With tortured body and despairing cry,<br>
       And then spied Harry shivering at my side,<br>
       Asking how I came there, when I replied,<br>
       Why, I was going off, I gasping said,<br>
       I've been most miserable since I went to bed,<br>
       This is the climax, I have suffered so<br>
       That I am quite determined now to go.<br>
       Nonsense, said Harry, come upstairs again,<br>
       I'm sorry you've been put to so much pain,<br>
       But I will soon make all things right, you'll see.<br>
       No, in this house I'll never happy be;<br>
       I'm much obliged for all your kind intent,<br>
       But am on leaving resolutely bent,<br>
       For what with handles, tubes, bells, wires and such,<br>
       With pipes, coils, batteries, and knobs to push,<br>
       I've almost lost my head, am racked with pain,<br>
       And long my own snug lodgings to regain.<br>
       Well, wait at least until the men arrive,<br>
       When we can to the station quickly drive,<br>
       And meanwhile Jane your breakfast shall prepare.<br>
       No, no, I cannot wait for Jane, I then declare,<br>
       Pray let me go, or I shall miss the train;<br>
       Good-bye, in town we'll shortly meet again,<br>
       I've left a note to tell the reason why<br>
       I felt obliged to go; again, good-bye.<br>
       I'd not gone far along the path before<br>
       I ventured to look back again once more.<br>
       Then walking at a less excited rate<br>
       I just remembered that within the gate<br>
       Electric wires were laid, so, turning round.<br>
       And seeing Harry still upon the ground,<br>
       Cried, is there any danger at the gate?<br>
       Danger, what do you mean? at any rate<br>
       You're sure there're no more wires or such like thing,<br>
       No coils or batteries, no more bells to ring?<br>
       Oh, nothing of the kind, you need not fear,<br>
       But, Frank, said Hal, come back and reason hear.<br>
       I shook my head and resolutely cried,<br>
       No, thank you, for that moment I espied<br>
       Jane opening shutters, so I quickly pushed<br>
       Aside the gate, and out exulting rushed.<br>
       I breathed more freely when once fairly through,<br>
       And o'er the highway to the station flew.<br>
       I caught the early train and reached my home,<br>
       Almost determined nevermore to roam,<br>
       For what I'd suffered on that single night,<br>
       Was quite enough to make me die of fright;<br>
       And as I sank upon my chair I said,<br>
       Thank goodness, I've no wires above my head,<br>
       For as to lighting gas I'd rather stir<br>
       And light it with the humble lucifer;<br>
       Encounter burglar with my own strong arm,<br>
       In place of man traps to create alarm;<br>
       Pull at the shower bath in a Christian way,<br>
       And face to face with friends my visits pay,<br>
       Than have electric wires take my commands,<br>
       And do the honest work of willing hands.

      IT IS BUT AN AUTUMN LEAFLET.
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      It is but a bright autumn leaflet,<br>
       Blown adrift from the fond parent stem,<br>
       To wither and perish in silence,<br>
       Like many a flowering gem;<br>
       But I gathered the flame-tinted treasure,<br>
       As it fluttering fell at my feet,<br>
       To send to my own absent darling,<br>
       Her radiant glances to greet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew in the grand air of freedom,<br>
       From the heart of the mountain sod,<br>
       Fulfilling its destiny gladly,<br>
       In cheerful obedience to God.<br>
       It struggled through life well and bravely,<br>
       'Gainst wind, cruel night, frost and storm,<br>
       Which gained it that bright sheen of glory,<br>
       Its fond dying face to adorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis said that the song of the bulbul,<br>
       Floating sweetly through calm moonlit skies,<br>
       As he sings to his dearly loved partner,<br>
       Is the sweetest just ere he dies;<br>
       So it seemed that the leaflet whilst dying,<br>
       Was discoursing of love from its core,<br>
       Which gave it a beauty and glory<br>
       It had never appeared in before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It spoke of a life in the future,<br>
       Transcending the glory of this,<br>
       Where hearts in harmonious concert,<br>
       Would form an existence of bliss.<br>
       So I gathered the love-freighted leaflet,<br>
       Which brought such sweet message to me,<br>
       In hopes that its heavenly language,<br>
       Might be eloquent also to thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      For I knew that the beautiful message,<br>
       Came from fond nature's glorious king,<br>
       So I linked it in rhythmical measure,<br>
       For you, my own darling, to sing.<br>
       And as your clear voice gives it utterance,<br>
       Think of her who has sent it to thee,<br>
       As a love-laden token and blessing,<br>
       From her fond heart far over the sea.

    <p class="dropverse">
      Never did rosy morning<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Sweep o'er the skirts of night,<br>
       Calm nature's face adorning,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With more intense delight;<br>
       Never did earth exultant<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Summon her offspring all,<br>
       To life-work, love and duty<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With more inspiring call,
    </p>
    <p>
      Than in the young spring season,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Three centuries ago,<br>
       When Roberval set sail from France<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To skim broad ocean's flow.<br>
       Nobles, rich, young and restless,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Statesmen and soldiers too,<br>
       Women of birth, and sailors,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Composed the adventurous crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving St. Malo's harbour.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; They steered in Cartier's wake,<br>
       For that New France which Francis hoped<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; A source of wealth to make.<br>
       For of it wondrous stories<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Were floating in the air,<br>
       A very Paradise it seemed<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of joy beyond compare.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vast, mysterious country,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Studded with gems and gold,<br>
       Where virgin soil and forests grand<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Were girt by headlands bold.<br>
       A land of beauty, where 'twas said<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Celestial fountains played,<br>
       Whose waters made the aged young,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And Time's dread havoc stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the thrilling stories<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of ancient Florida.<br>
       And of that favoured part of it<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Now known as Canada.<br>
       France, prompted by ambition,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was on its conquest bent,<br>
       Though Rome to Spain had given<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The whole vast continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To subjugate a people<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In wildest freedom bred,<br>
       Whose trade was armed barter,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To utmost hardship wed,<br>
       To potent savage nations,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To teach the white man's creed;<br>
       This was the hardy project<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; That France's king decreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the group of women<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was Marguerite, the fair<br>
       Niece of the Viceroy, Roberval,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Young, lovely, debonnaire,<br>
       Like gleams of summer sunshine<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; That glorify the sea,<br>
       Among the ship's companions,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Her presence seemed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, too, was a young noble,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Who with her left his home,<br>
       Content all honours to renounce,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With her he loved to roam;<br>
       Together had they plighted<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their vows before high heaven,<br>
       To the new faith together<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Their pledged adhesion given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before their loving pastor,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And Marguerite's maid, with prayer,<br>
       These Huguenots in secret,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To sign the contract dare,<br>
       In the still hour of midnight,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst all were thought to be,<br>
       Bound in the gyves of slumber,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In that ship far out at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! a listening traitor,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Ere waned the morning star,<br>
       Prompted by hate and malice,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Had spread the secret far;<br>
       And Roberval rose furious,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In wild ungoverned rage,<br>
       Against the hated heretics,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; A deadly war to wage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast bind the men in irons,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The women thrust, he said,<br>
       Into a boat with fire-arms,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Some powder, meat and bread,<br>
       For see! the Isle of Demons<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Lies close athwart our lee,<br>
       And they the fit companions<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of its horned fiends shall be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild, infernal orgies<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of these winged imps of night<br>
       Yet fill the air with horror,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And thrill it with affright;<br>
       To these I now consign them,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Quick, thrust them out to sea,<br>
       And through a life of torture<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; May they repentant be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Roberval, the Viceroy,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Thundered his fierce commands,<br>
       As Leon, Marguerite's husband<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Burst from his iron bands,<br>
       Plunged headlong in the wild flood<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And toward the threatening shore,<br>
       Swam boldly forth'&mdash;defiant<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of him and ocean's roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swimmer and the boat's crew<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Long fought for life and breath,<br>
       And all appeared together<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Entering the jaws of death,<br>
       As Roberval steered from them,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Outbreathing curses loud,<br>
       And imprecations furious<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; That stout hearts chilled and cowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship receded&mdash;vanished,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving the wave-tossed three<br>
       All valiantly contending<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With the belated sea.<br>
       The swimmer battled fiercely,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With ocean's maddening strife,<br>
       As the frail women bravely<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Contended for dear life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till haply, thanks to heaven,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; They're saved, for see, they stand<br>
       Linked heart and hand together,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The three once more on land.<br>
       'Tis said infernal demons,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Beset them day and night,<br>
       And with their shrieks satanic<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Chilled them with dire affright.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a strong hand celestial<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was ever interposed,<br>
       And round about them ever<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; A viewless barrier closed.<br>
       Unutterably hideous,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Th' infernal brood of hell,<br>
       Howling in baffled fury,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Around them powerless fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time kind heaven<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Gave them a baby boy,<br>
       Who filled their hearts with rapture,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And thrilled them to new joy,<br>
       But death soon stole their treasure,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Then Leon made his own<br>
       The Norman nurse then summoned,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And Marguerite was alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone on that dread island,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In whose accursed soil<br>
       Her loved ones found unhallowed rest<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; From harrowing care and toil.<br>
       Still courage never failed her,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Though fettered to the sod<br>
       Where hideous fiends assailed her,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To try her faith in God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though foes came gathering round her,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Appalling to the view,<br>
       From upper as from nether worlds,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And nearer lurking drew,<br>
       Of these, grim bears were foremost,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Who boldly round her close,<br>
       But with her gun brave Marguerite<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Slew three of these fierce foes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, though most gently nurtured,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; This maiden rose to be<br>
       A heroine undaunted<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; On the lone isle of the sea,<br>
       And Leon was a hero,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Who risked fame, fortune, life,<br>
       To be the sworn defender<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of helpless maid and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two dreary years of warfare<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Had passed o'er Marguerite's head,<br>
       Crowded with deeds heroic,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Since she with Leon wed,<br>
       When, far at sea some whalers<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Observed a curling smoke<br>
       Rise from the haunted island,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Which fear and wonder woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it the trick of demons<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To lure them to the shore,<br>
       And lead them on to ruin,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; As many had been before?<br>
       They thought it was, and kept aloof,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Then vague surmises made.<br>
       That some unhappy mortal<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Might need their timely aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, triumphing o'er terror,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; They warily drew nigh,<br>
       Descried a female figure<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Waving her signals high;<br>
       Clothed in the skins of white bears,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; So lovely she appeared,<br>
       That the brave-hearted sailors<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Most gladly toward her steered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Marguerite was rescued,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Through a heaven-directed chance,<br>
       Restored to home and country<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In her beloved France.<br>
       'Tis said the baffled demons<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; At her departure fled,<br>
       And never to the island<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Again their legions led.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firm in her new faith, Marguerite<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was a brave pioneer,<br>
       Of those devoted Hugenots,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To true hearts justly dear,<br>
       Who, half a century after,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Composed that sturdy flock,<br>
       Who from the good ship <i>May Flower</i><br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Landed on Plymouth rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who shall say how many<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; This noble woman led,<br>
       To break their bonds asunder,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Who were to priestcraft wed?<br>
       And as I close this ballad,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Historically true,<br>
       Learn, reader, that its heroes<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Toiled not in vain for you.

      A touching tragedy had been installed<br>

       Who in each other's joys and griefs had share;<br>
       Grave statesmen, merchants, all in that brief hour,<br>
       Sat spell-bound by the dramatist's rare power.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in an instant the appalling cry<br>
       Of fire! fire!! fire!!! was heard resounding high;<br>
       The terror-stricken crowd in blank dismay<br>
       Rushed frantically towards each narrow way.
    </p>
    <p>
      No ears had they for the brave girl who sought<br>
       To counsel in that hour with horror fraught,<br>
       Who cried "We are between you and the fire,<br>
       Be calm, for God's sake, in this danger dire."
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      [Footnote: On the first alarm of fire and whilst others were
      escaping, Miss Kate Claxton with three other actors came
      bravely forward to the footlights uttering these words of
      passionate entreaty.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Those nearest haply reached the narrow way,<br>
       And thanking God, emerged from the affray,<br>
       Whilst others stumbled, dazed with terror wild<br>
       And soon in tangled heaps lay powerless piled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In wildest proxysms of fear and pain,<br>
       Each sought his giddy footing to retain,<br>
       Whilst piercing cries of agonized despair,<br>
       Rose through the gloomy smoke-charged stifling air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suffocation, oft more merciful<br>
       Than fire, its victims claimed to lull,<br>
       Scared victims, gasping for that precious air,<br>
       Which fire and smoke alike refused them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast hurried on the greedy tongues of fire,<br>
       To make of those dread mounds a funeral pyre,<br>
       As raging onward o'er their victims broke,<br>
       The fearful conflict of the fire and smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dread was the scene o'er which the Fire King laughed<br>
       As he his bowl of frantic pleasure quaffed,<br>
       Whilst the doomed structure tottered in the girth<br>
       Of his wild, bellowing, satanic mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong men and feeble women, young and old,<br>
       Statesmen, financiers, and warriors bold,<br>
       Who were a short hour since elate with pride.<br>
       Now charred and calcined, slumber side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fierce insatiate fire-fiend raging flew<br>
       In wild demoniac rage the structure through,<br>
       Tearing down rafters, hurling to the ground,<br>
       Props, pillars roof-beams with appalling sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! what a scene of strife raged wildly there,<br>
       'Mid cries for help and struggles of despair;<br>
       All human efforts powerless to assuage,<br>
       The greedy fire-fiend's devastating rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fiery monster dashed away all trace,<br>
       Of that late mimic world of beauteous grace,<br>
       Swallowing in a fleet, wrathful breath of rage,<br>
       All the vain baubles of the tinseled stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the wild tumult has subsided now,<br>
       Hushed is the pleading prayer and woe strung vow,<br>
       Breathed by fond parents, brothers, husbands, wives<br>
       Of near three hundred late exultant lives!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the demon's rage was well nigh spent,<br>
       He o'er the drenched and trampled corses bent,<br>
       Effacing as he best could, every trace<br>
       Of recognition from each ghastly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drunken and gorged the sated fire-fiend spread<br>
       His gloomy sable shroud about the dead,<br>
       And left the fort he could not longer hold<br>
       Conquered by man's heroic efforts bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too painful 'twould be to prolong the tale,<br>
       Of that which followed, or the piteous wail<br>
       Of friends bereaved, who sought with harrowing dread,<br>
       To single out their loved ones from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close we, by urging those in power to do<br>
       What well becomes all rulers wise and true,<br>
       To make new laws, enforced by vigorous means,<br>
       To spare all repetition of such scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oft will Columbia sing to future time,<br>
       Of her centennial union sublime<br>
       But ever with the memorable year,<br>
       Will mingle memories of this history drear.

      THE NAINI TAL CATASTROPHE OF THE 18TH SEPTEMBER, 1880.
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      The morning broke with streams of welcome rain,<br>
       Such as the two preceding ones had brought.<br>
       Rain, that in tropic climes means life and joy<br>
       To man and beast as to the thirsty soil<br>
       And though the sky hung like a sable pall<br>
       Over the fair oasis, nestling calm<br>
       Beneath the trusted shelter of the hills,<br>
       And o'er the broad lake-outlet of the floods,<br>
       What cause had they to fear? 'Twas often thus,<br>
       And the long wished-for rains would bring forth joy<br>
       So reasoned they who, peaceful, viewed unmoved<br>
       Th' outpouring of that sullen ocean cloud,<br>
       When suddenly, they who had calmly felt<br>
       So safe one little span of time before,<br>
       Discovered in dismay the swollen floods<br>
       Meant danger&mdash;that the safety of their homes.<br>
       Was menaced, walls were tottering, waters rose,<br>
       Sapping foundations, threatening precious life.<br>
       Security was lost in maddening fear,<br>
       And, panic-stricken in disordered haste<br>
       And direst plight, they quit their homes, and fly<br>
       To seek a refuge from the merciless,<br>
       Relentless flood. On, on, they wildly rush,<br>
       No matter where, so they preserve the lives<br>
       Of those they dearly, passionately love.<br>
       Some o'er fierce rolling streams are helped by men<br>
       In mercy sent to render priceless aid,<br>
       And happy they, the rescued, who escape,<br>
       For scarcely had they timely refuge found,<br>
       Than a huge limb of the great mountain fell,<br>
       Sweeping the fair hill-side of house and land,<br>
       And burying dozens of their fellow men<br>
       In one uncompromising, living tomb!
    </p>
    <p>
      Brave men with tender hearts and stalwart arms,<br>
       Regardless of their lives flew quickly there.<br>
       Seeking to save their fellows; but, alas!<br>
       The task is useless, they are past all aid;<br>
       The cold earth sepulchres their mortal frames&mdash;<br>
       Still, hope's star-beacon lures the toilers on,<br>
       And with stout hearts and mercy sinewed arms,<br>
       They, toiling, dig, if haply they may save<br>
       But one poor soul from out the piteous heap.<br>
       But as they worked, their honest hearts elate<br>
       With love-inspiring toil, Oh, sad to tell!<br>
       Another mass, far larger than the last,<br>
       Fell from the dark flood-loosened mountain side,<br>
       Burying those noble men beneath the deep<br>
       Dank heap, like those they fondly hoped to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      O noble band! thy Christ-like heroism<br>
       Shall be enshrined in deathless memories<br>
       Outliving time; for rolling ages love<br>
       To chronicle the history of brave deeds,<br>
       That spur by their example other minds<br>
       To acts of heroism such as thine!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! fearful was that avalanche of earth,<br>
       That in its fury, e'en with lightning speed,<br>
       Swept to eternity such precious freight!<br>
       Strong men in the proud glory of life's prime,<br>
       Women in joyful trustfulness of love<br>
       With little children in full bloom of life;<br>
       All in the twinkling of an eye cut down,<br>
       In that rude harvest of the tyrant Death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the late lovely valley, Naini Tal<br>
       Stands as a witness of the frailty<br>
       Of human strength 'gainst the o'erwhelming might<br>
       Of forces, which the All Mighty only guides;<br>
       Proving, that great as oftimes is man's force,<br>
       It is as nothing, when the elements<br>
       Proclaim Him monarch of all power and might,<br>
       In language for the world to comprehend.

      Now, welcome home, ye valiant band,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; By science lured to roam,<br>
       Thrice welcome to your native land,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To Britain's hearth and home;<br>
       For ye have conquered many a foe,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And vanquished many a fear,<br>
       Since in your country's name ye sailed<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; So bravely forth last year.

    <p>
      Then many a fervent "Good speed ye"<br>

      There we find sweet repose and peace,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of coming joys above.

      It is but a lone faded rosebud<br>

      It opens the floodgates of memory,<br>

      For hearts that have once truly mingled,<br>

       Can never be really sundered<br>
       Though oceans and seas roll between.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still I will cherish my rosebud,<br>
       Though it never may bloom to a flower,<br>
       As a symbol of love that was strangled<br>
       In life's saddest yet happiest hour.

      O ye in power, thus placed to minister<br>
       To every pressing local, social claim,<br>
       Of those who gave you this authority,<br>
       Trusting you to act wisely in their name,<br>
       See that the precious heirloom of our race,<br>
       For which our fathers suffered, toiled and bled,<br>
       Our glorious Constitution, Britain's pride,<br>
       Be to the people's rights in justice wed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withhold not from them what in trust ye guard,<br>
       For calm enjoyment on the day of rest,<br>
       By opening parks, museums, libraries,<br>
       That their closed treasures be enjoyed with zest.<br>
       Why should our city's priceless treasures not<br>
       Be freely open on the day of rest,<br>
       That the inspiring thoughts of noble minds<br>
       Be to the people thus divinely blest?
    </p>
    <p>
      And if the masses do not agitate,<br>
       For free admission to these works of art,<br>
       This fact adds reason more why cultured men,<br>
       Should lead them in these joys to share a part.<br>
       This day was made for man, not he for it,<br>
       And should he to him of all days the best,<br>
       For moral, physical and mental life,<br>
       Since calm exertion may be actual rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the study of the Father's laws,<br>
       And survey of His wondrous works and power,<br>
       Seen through all nature's grand and wondrous realm,<br>
       Is fit enployment for a Sunday hour;<br>
       Think ye the public house a fitter place,<br>
       In which to spend that blessed afternoon?<br>
       I fear that many of you must do so,<br>
       Or you would grant what has been claimed right soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet object lessons from the King of Kings<br>
       Are found in animal and insect life,<br>
       And birds and fishes, beauteous flowers and trees,<br>
       Are with such lessons eloquently rife;<br>
       So are the gracious, light-dispensing heavens,<br>
       Grand ocean's depths and mountain heights sublime,<br>
       Day's regent King, night's lovely gentle Queen,<br>
       Each one discoursing of the Power Divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've lived in Paris and in wonder seen,<br>
       A mighty host of people wend their way<br>
       In thousands, to the lovely sylvan park<br>
       Of Versailles, to spend part of that blest day,<br>
       In families of husband, children, wife,<br>
       With basket of refreshments, simple, pure,<br>
       Which, seated on some verdant bank, they shared,<br>
       In peaceful happiness, serene and sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've watched them closely, willing to detect,<br>
       In those past days of prejudice and pride,<br>
       Some flaw of conduct, wantonness, excess,<br>
       Which I could criticise, rebuke or chide,<br>
       But I was staggered not to find save one<br>
       Excess of drunkenness in that vast throng,<br>
       And that one was a foreigner, which proved<br>
       That all my foregone censure had been wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      And further careful observation proved<br>
       Tha wisdom of thus opening freely all<br>
       Art treasures, which refine and cultivate,<br>
       Whilst giving joy alike to great and small,<br>
       For families, who, parted all the week,<br>
       On this one day could mingle happily,<br>
       And bodily, as well as mental health,<br>
       Be thus promoted most agreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd passed pleasantly and peacefully<br>
       Through the rich treasures in the palace spread,<br>
       And to his credit, be it here remarked,<br>
       The priest full oft these happy parties led;<br>
       They passed the forenoon of the day at church<br>
       In prayer and praise to the great Lord of all,<br>
       And now in calm enjoyment praised <i>Him</i> here,<br>
       Who hears when and where'er his children call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then ye who rule this city, pause I pray,<br>
       Give to this subject your attention best,<br>
       And make the Sunday to the poor as rich,<br>
       A day of liberty, a day of rest.<br>
       Let each be free to exercise his choice;<br>
       For to keep Britain really great and free,<br>
       We should not fetter consciences, or yet<br>
       Deprive its people of true liberty.

       &nbsp;&nbsp; To skim o'er the silvery tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the joy that awaits on all well-performed work,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Engaged in by youth, child, or man,<br>
       Whilst employing the powers which to him God has given,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And labouring as well as he can,
    </p>
    <p>
      They pushed from the shore, their young spirits elate.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In a trance of enjoyment and pride;<br>
       For were they not reaping the cherished reward<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Which to labour is never denied?
    </p>
    <p>
      Far happier than kings, as light-hearted as birds<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Who warbled spring carols on high,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Neath a cloudless, sun-glorified sky.

    <p>
      They had chatted together while making their boats,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp; Fair balance in the risk they might run.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, in increasing and joyful delight,<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp; In a twinkling was ruthlessly tost.

    <p>
      His nearest companion, young Whittaker, sprang,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; His canoe prompt assistance to lend,<br>

    <p>
      Young Girling was some distance off, but at once<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To the rescue most gallantly sprang,<br>
       As meantime the cry of "a boy drowning," loud<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Through the air supplicatingly rang.

      And the mother of Girling, who heard that wild cry,<br>

       Plunged fearlessly into the tide, where her son<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Was struggling with stout heart and hand
    </p>
    <p>
      To reach his poor friend, and the brave mother sought<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage his efforts to save,<br>
       While she, who, like him, could not swim, struggled
      hard,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Kept afloat by her clothes on the wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But vain were their efforts, the telegraph boy<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Had sunk 'neath the pitiless wave,<br>
       And his poor lifeless body, so late full of life,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Now lies in its calm ocean grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to shrill cries for assistance, some men<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Put off in a boat, all too late!<br>
       Instead of at once plunging in to the boy,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Thus heartlessly left to his fate,
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis said one of three or four beings called men,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Calmly standing close by on the land,<br>
       Threw stones to direct where the poor boy had sunk,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In reply to the woman's demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been told, but 'tis almost too hard to believe,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; That one of these beings could swim,<br>
       But was too great a coward and poltroon to risk<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; The endangering of life or of limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      But enough of such sickening allusions as these;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Those who might have saved life, lost what
      none<br>
       Who never ennoble their lives by good deeds,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Could imagine of happiness won
    </p>
    <p>
      By hearts braced with courage, regardless of self,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Such as John Girling's mother displayed,<br>
       Who, like a true hero, sublimely risked life<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; In those efforts, alas! vainly made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there not on this isle some society formed<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To reward such brave deeds as this one?<br>
       For surely humanity could not withhold<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Recompense for such gratitude won!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us hope that this sad, painful history may lead<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Every one to determine to try,<br>
       The fine art of swimming to master forthwith,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Ere the now opening season pass by.
    </p>
    <p>
      For doubtless the poor boy might yet have been spared,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Had he known how to swim or to float,<br>
       As very few strokes might have brought him to shore,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; When he slipped from his slight fragile boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis sweet to record the good conduct and life<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Of this well-beloved, motherless boy,<br>
       In the hope that it may to his absent sire's heart<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Convey some consolation and joy.

      Teacher sublime, great, grand and free!<br>
       My spirit loves and honours thee,<br>

    </p>

      Grand, comprehensive standard this,<br>

    </p>
    <p>
      Could any sect or doctrine claim<br>
       A higher, nobler, holier aim?<br>
       And should not all religion tend,<br>
       To this all-glorious god-like end?
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest teacher ever known,<br>
       This simple rule of life has shown<br>
       Should be the standard for all time,<br>

       Makes love to God and love to man,<br>
       Embrace all duties, and insure<br>
       Virtue and happiness most pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why vex the world with differing creeds,<br>
       Which meet not universal needs,<br>
       Which sore perplex and lead the mind<br>
       To separate, not link mankind?
    </p>
    <p>
      For would not self-denial spring<br>
       From such rich soil, and blessings bring,<br>
       Which would provoke each one to be<br>
       His brother's helper ceaselessly?
    </p>
    <p>
      If each love God with heart and mind,<br>
       And treat as brethren all mankind,<br>
       All other virtues must perforce,<br>
       Outflow from such inspiring source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such life divine inspired within,<br>
       Would form stern barriers to all sin,<br>
       And be the motive power to lead,<br>
       To all that man could wish or need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blest reason, long dethroned, might then<br>
       Become the guide of erring men,<br>
       Blind superstition meet its doom,<br>
       Within an unregretted tomb.

      Let all with one accord then bend,<br>
       Their powers to further this grand end,<br>

       Through perfumed breath they sing their God-taught-lay,<br>
       Root firmly bedded in the active sod,<br>

      Who has not treasured some poor faded flower?<br>
       In token of a radiant, love lit hour,<br>

       Is the inestimable gift of health;<br>
       But as this precious gift of heaven is placed<br>
       Greatly within our power to use or waste,<br>
       Should not its scientific study claim<br>
       Our grave attention and our best care gain?<br>
       Without it, the bright jewel of the mind<br>
       Is apt to get distorted, weak and blind,<br>
       And if not previously well schooled and trained,<br>
       Becomes to fears unjustified enchained.<br>
       This chiefest blessing of all bounteous heaven,<br>
       Is to His children by the Father given<br>
       As a productive talent, to be used<br>
       For universal good, and not abused.<br>
       It thus becomes a solemn charge, that each<br>
       Who understands it thus, should others teach,<br>
       By individual efforts, and means paid,<br>
       For missionary service widely laid,<br>
       And as strong healthy minds so much depend,<br>
       On healthy bodies; to this righteous end.<br>
       Should not all education be then based<br>
       On this foundation and with it enlaced?<br>
       Let children even, learn that kindly heaven,<br>
       To them this priceless heritage has given,<br>
       Which they must learn to use with constant care,<br>
       And of its dangerous abuse beware.<br>
       Why should they not be early taught to know<br>
       The dire effects from alcohol that flow,<br>
       As well as the right use of generous food.<br>
       And well-timed exercise to cleanse the blood.<br>
       To trace th' effects that flow from every cause:<br>
       With ventilation's most important laws,<br>
       Of cleanliness of mind and person too,<br>
       And strict exactitude in all they do,<br>
       And to breathe through their nostrils, meant to be<br>
       Their ever ready respirator free:<br>
       To masticate, not bolt their food, and try<br>
       To learn themselves, and know the reason why.<br>
       Thus being early taught, in after life<br>
       They might be better armoured for the strife<br>
       Of fierce temptations, which, when conquered, can<br>
       Strengthen and elevate the inner man,<br>
       For soon or later each is bound to learn,<br>
       That every talent must make fair return,<br>
       To Him who mercifully gave its use,<br>
       For joyful happiness, and not abuse.<br>
       There are three sanitary agents given<br>
       To mankind, by the gracious God of heaven,<br>
       Freely and without stint, for all who choose<br>
       These blessed ministers of His to use.<br>
       These agents blest are, water, light and air,<br>
       Abundantly provided everywhere,<br>
       Flowing so freely o'er the outstretched earth,<br>
       That man has scarcely yet discerned their worth.<br>
       The wind is earth's great ventilating force,<br>
       Water the cleansing, purifying course,<br>
       Light the awakening, stimulating power,<br>
       To nature as to man Heaven's priceless dower.<br>
       Important lessons they each hourly teach,<br>
       Which every creature has within his reach,<br>
       For the same laws that nature's rule apply<br>
       To every member of God's family,<br>
       Bringing stern punishment for every cause<br>
       Involved in disobeying His great laws.<br>
       All honour to the band of pioneers,<br>
       Who nobly fought 'midst opposition sneers<br>
       T' establish sanitary laws, through all<br>
       Our towns and cities, for the great and small,<br>
       So that preventable disease might be<br>
       Assaulted, and stamped out effectually,<br>
       And that diseases which perforce remain<br>
       Might fuller scientific treatment claim;<br>
       And, thanks to Heaven, the fight was not in vain,<br>
       For their wise teaching was so simple, plain,<br>
       That thousands were induced to join th' affray<br>
       And aid the righteous scheme to win the day,<br>
       So that a large share of the nation's wealth<br>
       Was gained to minister to public health:<br>
       And now, no longer are our towns disgraced<br>
       By filthy sewage and foul noxious waste,<br>
       And every corporation through the land<br>
       Is bound on this wise scheme to take its stand.<br>
       Medical science tells us that the skin<br>
       Is pierced by perspiratory tubes within,<br>
       In countless thousands, used for drainage pores;<br>
       Vessels secreting oil are found in stores,<br>
       Whilst more provide for growth, and others still<br>
       Carry off parts decayed with matchless skill,<br>
       Each needing daily cleansing with due care,<br>
       If we would health and mental vigour share.<br>
       Providing other strict conditions willed<br>
       By nature, be unswervingly fulfilled.<br>
       Thus it should be our first concern to learn,<br>
       The laws on which such vital interests turn.<br>
       The ambulance and cookery classes each,<br>
       In pleasant style much useful wisdom teach,<br>
       But are not patronized to the extent<br>
       They merit, in their practical intent.<br>
       The winter course of science lectures free<br>
       A spur to much research has proved to be,<br>
       Where representatives from every class,<br>
       The most delightful hours together pass.<br>
       And what a joy it is to sit at ease,<br>
       Listening to words that educate and please,<br>
       From master minds who know their subject well,<br>
       And on its salient points delighted dwell.<br>
       These with free libraries and concerts tend<br>
       Much happiness with useful work to blend;<br>
       And our fair city may be proud to know,<br>
       Th' uplifting forces which from them outflow.<br>
       The despotism of custom in our day<br>
       To much benignant progress bars the way,<br>
       While superstition, ignorance and sloth<br>
       Oppose all national and mental growth.<br>
       But under education's brightening ray,<br>
       And blessed reason's intellectual sway,<br>
       These barriers are bound to disappear,<br>
       And leave the path to progress free and clear.<br>
       The dogmatism of fashion too is crime,<br>
       When injuring the human form sublime,<br>
       By its stern mandates, which attract the weak,<br>
       Causing them nature's holiest laws to break,<br>
       By lacing tightly, to a model form,<br>
       Which fashion sternly says should then be worn;<br>
       This tightening in the vital organs so,<br>
       Prevents the circulation's healthy flow,<br>
       And thus the lungs and pliant ribs and heart,<br>
       Incapable of acting out the part<br>
       Assigned to them by nature, prove a prey<br>
       To premature diseases and decay.<br>
       We talk with pious horror and regret,<br>
       Of the unwise Chinese, who will not let<br>
       The feet of their poor female children grow,<br>
       Entailing thus unutterable woe;<br>
       But when unprejudiced the reason acts,<br>
       And we together scan th' appalling facts,<br>
       Resulting from tight lacing, and tight shoes,<br>
       We cannot conscientiously refuse,<br>
       To say that of the two vile customs, ours<br>
       Is certainly more culpable than theirs,<br>
       While we too are not guiltless or discreet,<br>
       Respecting our behaviour to our feet,<br>
       Making them hobble on high heels, with toes<br>
       Not half the width that should their forms enclose;<br>
       So we should be more modest when we seek<br>
       To satirize them and their customs-weak,<br>
       Remembering that we too are much to blame,<br>
       And like them merit censure and much shame.<br>
       How wisely Israel's poet songster said,<br>
       That cleanliness to godliness is wed,<br>
       For filthiness of body must conduct,<br>
       Impurities which mental life obstruct.<br>
       How well are engineers on the alert,<br>
       To keep their engines free from dust and dirt,<br>
       Knowing that without such great care from them,<br>
       They could not do the work required by men;<br>
       So neither can we hope our bodies will<br>
       Their heaven directed work aright fulfil,<br>
       If their machinery is not kept free,<br>
       From foul obstruction and impurity.<br>
       Science and nature then should be our guide,<br>
       Instructive lessons they for all provide,<br>
       Teaching us how the pleasant winds insure<br>
       That atmospheric air is sweet and pure;<br>
       God's antidote they are, invisible,<br>
       To poisonous vapours else unbearable,<br>
       Which steam from all decaying substances,<br>
       Throughout the earth's wide-spread dependences.<br>
       But as men civilized do not exist<br>
       Always in open air, these guides insist,<br>
       That as God uses circulating air,<br>
       To purify and sweeten everywhere,<br>
       That we should also, through our dwellings wide<br>
       An ever circulating air provide,<br>
       As we, like other animals outpour,<br>
       Foul, poisonous vapours too from every pore.<br>
       How well bees understand effects and cause,<br>
       Of breaking ventilation's righteous laws,<br>
       For see, their crowded hive with straw inlaid,<br>
       Has in it but one tiny opening made,<br>
       And yet the many thousand inmates there,<br>
       Have better, purer, more refreshing air,<br>
       Than men and women, in close bedrooms pent<br>
       For seven or eight long hours, without a vent<br>
       To carry off empoisoned loathsome air,<br>
       That they are stupidly content to share.<br>
       If we could look within the hive we'd see,<br>
       Full two score bees holding tenaciously,<br>
       With firm grasp to the floor, unceasingly<br>
       Flapping their tiny wings with energy,<br>
       And as they fall off wearied, others come<br>
       To take their place, with merry hum,<br>
       And thus they work, without a moment's pause,<br>
       Exemplifying ventilation's laws,<br>
       By forcing good air to supplant the bad,<br>
       And so escape the consequences sad<br>
       Of poisonous vapours and contracted homes,<br>
       For which their heaven-taught wisdom thus atones;<br>
       Proving they are indeed, inspired to be<br>
       Exponents of the laws of Deity.<br>
       And if still further witness is required,<br>
       To prove what nature teaches be desired,<br>
       Let us in fancy's aerial chariot fly<br>
       To Bengal's capital, and once more try<br>
       To demonstrate from just another side,<br>
       The evils which infected air provide;<br>
       For it is just a century ago,<br>
       Calcutta furnished such a tale of woe,<br>
       As surely seldom has been found before<br>
       In any other country's saddest lore.<br>
       The Great Mogul of India had allowed,<br>
       The English to have factories endowed,<br>
       In certain parts of his dominion wide,<br>
       Which soon became a source of wealth and pride,<br>
       To those who laboured in them, and it chanced<br>
       That a barbarian Nabob on them glanced<br>
       With envious eyes, Suragah Dowlah named.<br>
       The tributary king Bengal then claimed,<br>
       And this barbarian monster, one fine day<br>
       Led a large army to the factory<br>
       Built at Calcutta, and so suddenly<br>
       Did he attack the place that the small band<br>
       Of a few hundred English could not stand<br>
       A moment 'gainst his several thousand men,<br>
       As they at most but numbered one to ten;<br>
       Defence was useless, so they wildly fled<br>
       To ships within the harbour, by hope led<br>
       To find a refuge there; several of whom<br>
       Thereby escaped a most disastrous doom,<br>
       But others were pursued and brought to bay,<br>
       Which formed th' appalling history of the day,<br>
       For in the wild confusion of the fight,<br>
       Above six score were captured in their flight;<br>
       These the victorious Nabob, had immured<br>
       Within the fortress prison, well secured,<br>
       Too well, alas! for the contracted den,<br>
       Known as the "Black Hole of Calcutta" then,<br>
       But eighteen feet in length by fourteen wide.<br>
       Could air for twenty men at most provide;<br>
       And there were four score odd strong, stalwart men,<br>
       Thrust into that abominable den;<br>
       Having but two small holes for windows there<br>
       For the admission of Heaven's blessed air,<br>
       Crushed in with violent brutality,<br>
       Shoulder to shoulder they stood gaspingly.<br>
       No room to stir in that accursed place,<br>
       They pressed in ghastly horror, face to face;<br>
       The anguish of the captives soon became<br>
       Greater than any pen or word could name;<br>
       The neighbourhood resounded with their cries,<br>
       Which all description utterly defies,<br>
       But as the night wore on, these ravings ceased,<br>
       As most of the poor victims got released,<br>
       From their most agonising pain, by death;<br>
       Whilst the remainder scarce had gasping breath.<br>
       Thus when the morrow's blessed sun arose,<br>
       It did a most revolting sight disclose,<br>
       A ghastly spectacle of horror, where<br>
       Were six score loathsome corpses upright there,<br>
       Whilst jammed between them, in the filthy den,<br>
       Were twenty-three more miserable men,<br>
       Who hardly could be said to be alive,<br>
       So fearfully did death among them strive<br>
       To make them all his own, leaving no trace<br>
       Of aught but spectre life in that vile place.<br>
       This dreadful history cannot fail to show,<br>
       How fatal consequences surely flow,<br>
       From disregard of the Creator's laws,<br>
       For these foul poisonous vapours were the cause<br>
       Of five score agonising deaths, within<br>
       The space of a few hours, from wilful sin.<br>
       Many such instances of equal weight,<br>
       I might from various other sources state,<br>
       To show what misery and direful woe,<br>
       From breaking nature's laws is sure to flow;<br>
       Whilst in the keeping of them, blessings pure<br>
       Flow in rewards continual and sure.<br>
       Then, seeing we have so much in our power,<br>
       Let us like the wise bees improve each hour,<br>
       Learn of so-called barbarians, to set free<br>
       The vital organs, to act easily,<br>
       And to defy dogmatic customs, when<br>
       They would enslave the intellect of men,<br>
       No longer nature's holy precepts break;<br>
       So shall sound bodies sounder minds soon make,<br>
       As such a course rich blessings surely brings<br>
       From the All Wise, All Mighty King of Kings.

      INGRATITUDE.
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      Ingratitude! gaunt spectre of the mind,<br>
       That is to every generous impulse blind,<br>
       Offspring of nature's callous, cold and stern,<br>
       Where selfishness and censure reign by turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hideous these spectres to the mental sight,<br>
       Black as the sable pall of darkest night,<br>
       As they await the summons of the mind,<br>
       That sends them forth to sting and wound mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cold response to acts of kindness born,<br>
       Ingratitude replies with scathing scorn,<br>
       Inflicting through these imps uncalled for pain,<br>
       And treating sympathy with cold disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only torturing others, they invent<br>
       New tortures for the one by whom they're sent,<br>
       Inflicting most excruciating pain,<br>
       During their diabolical black reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like you the picture, callous, selfish man!<br>
       If not, then shun its likeness, while you can;<br>
       Let truth and justice triumph over hate,<br>
       And rise triumphant to a happier state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Displace the imps ingratitude convokes,<br>
       By love-winged sprites that gratitude evokes;<br>
       Open thy mind to kindnesses received,<br>
       And be no longer blindly self-deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      For gratitude has angels at command,<br>
       Which form an ever ready willing band,<br>
       To fly on missions of all-conquering grace,<br>
       As from their path those hideous imps they chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      For darkness cannot live where there is light,<br>
       And so these imps detested take their flight,<br>
       Before the glories of this angel band,<br>
       They could not for a single moment stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sweet balm these love-winged sprites convey,<br>
       Strengthens and cheers recipients on their way;<br>
       Blessing the sender no less than the one<br>
       Who thus receives the grateful tribute won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, one good and self-denying deed,<br>
       To many others must in order lead,<br>
       And the sweet gratitude that they evoke,<br>
       Will other loving kindnesses provoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, why should we refuse Heaven's proffered chance<br>
       To universal happiness enhance,<br>
       By doing unto others as we, too,<br>
       Would wish that they to our own selves should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we could only make this law our care,<br>
       What untold blessings might we daily share,<br>
       For every effort through this guidance made,<br>
       Would be by heaven most graciously repaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      One firm step forward in the right path makes<br>
       The next more easy, and fresh courage wakes,<br>
       While the sweet power of conquering bestows<br>
       Accumulating interest as it grows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the proudest warrior is he<br>
       Who governs self with strict fidelity,<br>
       While the bright laurels which he gams will last,<br>
       When all earth's bloody victories are past.

       Then the historic tree that was the pride<br>
       Of Israel's wisest monarch, that defied<br>
       The elemental strife that ages feared<br>
       To build the Temple Solomon upreared.<br>
       Cedars of Lebanon! how proudly they<br>
       In tens of thousands clothed the mountain way,<br>
       In age-timed friendship with each throbbing star,<br>
       A miracle of beauty near and far.<br>
       Now only seven of these trees remain,<br>
       Grand landmarks to the Arabs of the plain,<br>
       Who in their shade their altars consecrate,<br>
       And their umbrageous shelter venerate.<br>
       London has full six thousand acres laid<br>
       In parks, for public recreation made;<br>
       Paris its Tuileries, with Fontainebleau,<br>
       St. Cloud, Versailles, where lovely fountains flow,<br>
       Vienna its great Prater, Frankfort too,<br>
       New York its Central Park in verdure new;<br>
       Whilst other towns and cities everywhere,<br>
       Are vieing each with each such joys to share<br>
       All exercise important sway supreme,<br>
       On public health and morals felt and seen.<br>
       By their community of pleasures pure,<br>
       Which rich and poor can equally insure,<br>
       These public gardens with their lakes and flowers<br>
       Preach better temperance lectures than the showers<br>
       Of eloquence their advocates display,<br>
       On thirsting toilers of the working day.<br>
       They form a sweet oasis from the care<br>
       And dissipations of the city's glare,<br>
       Where families of young and old may meet,<br>
       And friends on equal terms each other greet.<br>
       A people must its pleasures have, and so,<br>
       Whether they're virtuous, poisonous, fast or slow,<br>
       Depend on the directing minds that lead<br>
       The city's councils met for public need;<br>
       So it should be our great concern to see<br>
       Our rulers men of whole-souled charity.<br>
       Let national be rational delight,<br>
       Made profitable to each class by right,<br>
       That public parks may be a joy to all,<br>
       Men, women, rich and poor, and children small.<br>
       That, as in Germany, the people may<br>
       Find healthful pleasures in them day by day.<br>
       Thus the class social barriers which the pride<br>
       Of Anglo-Saxon nations still provide,<br>
       May yield beneath more kindly pressure lent,<br>
       To make all classes happily content.<br>
       What worthier monument could nations raise,<br>
       To merit from its masses grateful praise,<br>
       Than such attractive parks to educate,<br>
       And morals, minds and manners elevate?<br>
       For lectures on home subjects, not too long,<br>
       Might be delivered freely to the throng,<br>
       Exemplifying the Creator's laws,<br>
       Which yield their just effects to every cause,<br>
       Whilst music in sweet tones of band and voice,<br>
       Might lead the congregation to rejoice,<br>
       As well to educate as charm the ear,<br>
       And many a saddened heart uplift and cheer.

      TO A FAITHFUL DOG.
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      Dear Vixey! quadruped of noble type,<br>
       I fain would chant the praises of thy life,<br>
       Though words of mine are powerless and weak,<br>
       To sketch thy character, so brave yet meek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of sincere devotion, without bound,<br>
       Art thou to thy dear master, faithful hound!<br>
       Thy love for him refreshing is to see,<br>
       For in him centres thy felicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he is saddened or beset with fears<br>
       I've seen thy lovely eyes suffused with tears.<br>
       And thou hast nestled by him to express<br>
       Thy sympathy in eloquent caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when in happier mood, and accents bright<br>
       He speaks to thee, what transports of delight<br>
       Beam from thine eye where joy and peace prevail,<br>
       Upraise thy ears and elevate thy tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those solemn, full, expressive eyes of thine,<br>
       With fond affection and emotion shine,<br>
       As he permits thee to curl round and lie<br>
       Upon the sofa near him cozily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing will tempt thee to forsake his side,<br>
       Where thou reclinest, with delighted pride.<br>
       Vain are all efforts to divert thy choice,<br>
       Unless o'er-ruled by his belov&eacute;d voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whilst in Mrs. Mount's well-ordered room,<br>
       Where thou with him art dining after noon,<br>
       How knowingly thou dost inspect each face,<br>
       Where thou, instinctively, kind feelings trace.
    </p>
    <p>
      If thou could'st only speak, what tones of love<br>
       Would pass 'twixt thee and him, thy joy to prove,<br>
       For surely never could affection be<br>
       Stronger than thine in warmth and constancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serving each member of the family,<br>
       With true allegiance and fidelity,<br>
       Though chiefly to thy youngest mistress thou<br>
       Dost with affectionate submission bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albeit, thou wouldst forsake them all to win<br>
       One quiet word or coaxing look from him;<br>
       Thy first obedient loyalty is shown<br>
       To him who thou so proudly count'st thine own.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder, then, that he so prizes thee,<br>
       For such devotion and fidelity,<br>
       Which, even from a dog, can joy impart<br>
       To a despairing or a troubled heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy great, round eyes with eloquence express<br>
       Unselfish love and fullest confidence,<br>
       Almost beyond the power of words to tell,<br>
       When gazing on the one thou lov'st so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Vixey, I conclude by sending thee,<br>
       Over the boundless, intervening sea,<br>
       Many kind words and pats by the loved one<br>
       Who thy fond, ardent, faithful love has won.

      SELF DISCIPLINE.

    <p class="dropverse">
      Self discipline and perseverance strong,<br>
       Effort on effort, with endurance long,<br>
       Make kings of men, who subjugate and sway<br>
       Stern empire over self each hour of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They, like skilled generals, lead on the van<br>
       Of thoughts progressive in the inner man,<br>
       And marshal well their forces, so to fight<br>
       That truth and justice be diffused as light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such constitute an empire grand within,<br>
       Raise fortresses 'gainst known and secret sin,<br>
       And thus become brave conquerors, whose deeds<br>
       Leave all the monument that goodness needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They form a true refining power on earth,<br>
       A high nobility of sterling worth,<br>
       Who, though oft poor in worldly riches, may<br>
       Far nobler thrones than those of earth's kings sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triumphs o'er self-will, selfishness and pride,<br>
       Ensure a wealth of consequences wide,<br>
       Which gain the victor armour that shall win<br>
       Him further victories o'er self and sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But 'tis the will of heaven that each should keep<br>
       This armour bright, and sow what he would reap,<br>
       That industry unflinching, tireless zeal<br>
       Should to earth's workers rich results reveal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Endurance disciplines to sympathy,<br>
       Which deals a death blow to cold apathy,<br>
       Making its owner ready to risk all,<br>
       And smile down obstacles at duty's call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kind gentleness comes also in its train,<br>
       Constraining men to serve those some would blame.<br>
       Patient with erring strayed ones far from home<br>
       Sternly severe unto themselves alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes the blissful privilege that flows<br>
       Through self-denial, of assisting those<br>
       Who may through ignorance have lost their way,<br>
       Or blindly stumbled in the glare of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      That charity translated into love,<br>
       Is of all graces foremost, all may prove,<br>
       Meaning not merely money, which counts naught,<br>
       Unless with sympathetic kindness fraught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligible to the searching mind,<br>
       Is the Creator's message to mankind,<br>
       If it with fervour study His grand laws,<br>
       Which prove that each effect must have a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      As naught material is lost in space,<br>
       So nothing spiritual can man efface;<br>
       Exemplifying thus the axiom sure,<br>
       That conquering love, truth, justice must endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let each strive to serve as best he can.<br>
       His Father God, himself, and fellow man,<br>
       By subjugating self, and shewing forth<br>
       That justice, love, truth, peace, should rule on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then might that brotherhood which Christ ordained,<br>
       Be through the wide world practised and proclaimed,<br>
       As one grand creed for earth's vast family,<br>
       Of loving service to the Deity.

      THE CENTENARY OF A HERO.
    </h2><br>
     
    <p class="dropverse">
      George Stephenson, the heroic son of Britain's hardy
      race,<br>
       The world this day holds festival, his grand career to
      trace;<br>
       And proudly as compatriots England enshrines his name,<br>
       Among her choicest heroes, on her cherished scroll of fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ninth of June commemorates the glad centenary<br>
       Of him whom mighty nations hold in grateful memory;<br>
       A veritable hero he, worthy immortal praise,<br>
       And the most lavish monuments mankind may to him raise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the humblest ranks of life the Wylam pitman rose,<br>
       To a stern, irresponsive world great secrets to
      disclose;<br>
       And through the rare, majestic force of a God-inspiring
      will,<br>
       He forced the world his grand design and purpose to fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor, illiterate youth thus reared in penury extreme,<br>
       Could scarcely read or write ere he attained eighteen,<br>
       And yet, by the observant force of a self-guided brain,<br>
       He lived to benefit a world, and gain immortal fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Battered and forged by poverty, his iron spirit rose,<br>
       Unbroken and undaunted by the world's derisive blows,<br>
       Spurred on by opposition, through the sharp furnace
      leapt,<br>
       Strengthened and sharpened&mdash;a great power&mdash;this
      king of railroads stept.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life work in his vast results will long outlive the
      fame<br>
       Of warrior, statesman, ruler, bard, and make his honoured
      name<br>
       An inspiration for all time to prove what can be done<br>
       By observation, force and skill&mdash;what deathless laurels
      won!
    </p>
    <p>
      Take courage, sons of hardy toil, your iron spirits, too,<br>
       By stern, unflinching industry, may some wise forging
      do,<br>
       Which might yourselves ennoble, and benefit your race,<br>
       Who would in turn, with gratitude, your names delight to
      trace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sailed a trackless, unknown sea in the vast realms of
      thought,<br>
       Discovered paths to enterprise, with golden issues
      fraught,<br>
       Which lent fair commerce fleetest wings, and spurred the
      heels of trade,<br>
       And throughout Britain's pleasant land his iron highways
      laid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something there is in lives like these that stirs the soul of
      man,<br>
       With irresistible desire to do the best he can;<br>
       Like him, through dauntless industry, and noble, firm
      resolve,<br>
       To aid life's wheel of progress more smoothly to revolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus may his grand career inspire the multitude to-day,<br>
       Throughout the nation he has dowered all homage due to
      pay<br>
       To the majestic mind and will of him, whose honoured
      name<br>
       The British nation shrines anew, on the world's proud scroll

       Four little fairy maiden forms<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp; What eyes! what shaggy hair!<br>
       In this case happily the wolf<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Ne'er moved or spake a word;<br>
       Perhaps he was too much ashamed<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To have his gruff voice heard.<br>
       Then to my wondering gaze appeared<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Old goody in her shoe,<br>
       With all her numerous tribe that made<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Her not know what to do.<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp; All hearts as in a cage,<br>
       And bearing up her graceful train<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; A quite bewitching page.<br>
       Then the scene changed and nothing but<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; A barrel, labelled "flour,"<br>
       Appeared upon the mimic stage<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp; The household <i>flower</i> that night.<br>
       Then 'round a caldron on a grate<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; To spoil the broth appeared,<br>
       Five little dainty fairy cooks<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Whom <i>tout le monde</i> now cheered.<br>
       Next came the awful family squalls,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Which Granny vainly tried<br>
       To stay with Winslow's stuff for which<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Full many a babe has cried;<br>

       &nbsp;&nbsp; The fairy sprites so bright,<br>
       In robes <i>de nuit</i> with tapers lit,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; All sweetly sang "good night."<br>
       Good night, I cried; why, how is this;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Things are then what they seem,<br>
       And these sweet picture-paintings here<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Have not been all a dream?<br>
       For there's our doctor's pleasant smile,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; There the kind brothers Gale,<br>

      Well I remember, many years ago,<br>

       With six dear girls in lovely virgin prime,<br>
       Partaking of its rural joys sublime.<br>
       Sue, Polly, Edith, Amy, Maud,<br>
       Dear girls, whom no one could but love and laud;<br>
       I like a mother to them tried to be,<br>
       We were, in truth, a happy family.<br>
       Far from our homes, in foreign lands we strayed;<br>
       In Paris for twelve months our quarters made,<br>
       Studying most earnestly, serenely gay,<br>
       In the good <i>pension</i> of Madame Rey.<br>
       We visited the Palace, and roamed through<br>
       Its storied chambers and trim gardens, too,<br>

       Poor Marie Antoinette the fishes tamed,<br>

       Which we discussed with appetites made keen<br>
       By games and frolic on the meadow green.<br>
       The over-hanging wealth of summer trees<br>
       Were swayed by Zephyr's stimulating breeze,<br>
       While the sun's ardent glances played between<br>
       The joy-tossed leaves and frolicked on the green.<br>
       Wearied with a long ramble we reclined<br>
       Beneath the waving foliage, glad to find<br>
       A spot so lovely for a needful rest,<br>
       Feeling by nature there supremely blest.<br>
       Reclining 'neath the sun's inspiring kiss,<br>
       We felt by nature soothed to peaceful bliss,<br>
       Too great for human utterance of word,<br>
       Though our whole being was to rapture stirred.<br>
       Thus in a dumb delight our thoughts took wing,<br>
       In grateful homage to fond nature's king,<br>
       With newly waken'd resolutions blest,<br>
       During that hour of blessed, peaceful rest;<br>
       And when at length we from the sweet trance woke,<br>
       What joyful exclamations from us broke!<br>
       As all in one rich harmony agreed,<br>
       We felt from every earthly burden freed.<br>
       Then, coming on a lovely forest glade,<br>
       By a clear, purling brook refreshing made,<br>
       We sat upon some rocks that tempting lay,<br>
       Full in the smile of the sun's chastening ray,<br>
       And its full glory rested on the hills,<br>
       Falling on lonely brooklets, streams and rills,<br>
       While the West glowed with blazing, crimson fires,<br>
       Kindled to emulate divine desires.<br>
       The sun-lit glory streaming from the West<br>
       Lulled us once more to tranquil, joyous rest,<br>
       When, with a silent wonder, we espied<br>
       Most lovely lizards o'er the smooth stones glide.<br>
       Doubtless the pretty creatures were lured forth<br>
       By the supernal love light flooding earth,<br>
       And in rich robes, with gorgeous colours bright,<br>
       Were joining nature's transports of delight;<br>
       For 'twas the tranquilizing sunset hour,<br>
       When the great sun-god concentrates his power,<br>
       To spread refining influence and show<br>
       His colour painting to the earth below.<br>
       And thus refreshed, we bent our homeward way,<br>
       Strong in the gladdening influence of the day,<br>
       Gathering bright wreaths of wild flowers rare, to be<br>
       Mementoes of the day's felicity.

      <i>The first volume of</i> HOME LYRICS <i>was published

      others, comments from the press as follows:</i>

      The mantle of Mrs. Hemans may be said to have descended on
      Mrs. H. S. Battersby. She infuses into her poems the ardour
      of home affection; her faith is pure, and her hope
      unswerving. Many of her verses have inspiration from the
      clear, bracing air of Canadian skies. She loves the grandeur
      of nature; lofty rocks and waterfalls; forests whitened with
      snows, and vast frozen lakes, smooth as polished marble, and
      solid as granite. He who delights in the fauna and flora of
      nature has in every clime<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; "Which the eye of Heaven visits."<br>
       &nbsp;<br>
       a library fruitful of study and a pursuit which is innocent
      and healthful. Mrs. Battersby deduces a moral lesson in her
      spirited lines "To the Chaudi&egrave;re Falls, Canada"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, wild rolling waters; oh, white-crested
      foam,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; I, too, would press onward, right on to my
      home;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Like thee, with stern purpose, let nothing
      impede,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Or cause me to falter in courage or speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "My mission, like thine, is right onward to
      go,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Though tempests be raging and dark waters
      flow,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, might I, like these, with firm, resolute
      voice,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Through dangers, and even through tempests,
      rejoice!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      But the author reserves her warmest welcome and her loudest
      notes of praise for the charming scenery of her native land.
      "Beautiful Malvern" is dearer to her heart than the most
      romantic regions in Europe. More beloved than the snow-capped
      grandeur of the Alps, than the castle crowned Rhine,
      enshrined in the stanzas of a hundred poets, Helvetia's dark
      gorges, and the silvery cascade of Giessbach, calm Chamounix,
      and the gloomy dungeons and stake of the Castle of Chilon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "All these wonders of nature and wonders of
      mind,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; With their thousand attractions of beauty
      combined,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Have served but to strengthen my fond love for
      thee,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; And make thee, dear Malvern, still dearer to
      me."
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      This supports the quaint remark of a tourist that one of the
      great delights of travelling is the thought and anticipated
      pleasure of coming home again. From the subjects chosen for
      many of her poems the author has evidently made appeal rather
      to the narrow circle of her own near relations and friends
      than to that ever-increasing one which is expressed by the
      phrase of the "reading public." She writes thus in her
      preface, the brevity of which is much to be
      commended:&mdash;"They are published chiefly for the author's
      dear children, relations, and valued friends, to whose
      hearths and hearts it is hoped that they will, as HOME
      LYRICS, readily find their way."
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      In "A Painful History," Mrs. Battersby speaks boldly out
      against one of our social inequalities, which she sensibly
      and very justly denounces. All men of true honour must accept
      and endorse her verdict. Hood treats the same theme with all
      the tenderness of his fine sensitive nature, and with all
      that exquisite harmony which his refined muse had at ready
      command. HOME LYRICS is a charming little volume of poems,
      full of sincerity, grace, and devotional feeling.

      "One of the prettiest collections of poems we know of. It is
      very nicely printed, and the poems will be found to have a
      large amount of poetry in them. A more suitable present to a
      young friend we do not think could be found than this
      volume."

      Poetry will never die while there are Hearts and Homes. The
      poetical spirit of this accomplished lady has hovered over
      that sacred spot, Home, sweet Home, and there sung, like the
      Bethlehem angels, those sweet melodies of love. They are
      published, she tells us "chiefly for the author's dear
      children, relatives and valued friends, to whose hearths and
      hearts it is hoped that they will, as Home Lyrics, readily
      find their way." It is a fortune all its readers will wish
      it, where the gems under the gold-lettered, crimson covers
      will be often inspected, and the neat volume often made a
      Christmas or a New Year's gift.

      Under this title will shortly be published a volume of poems.
      We have seen the author's proofs and can testify to the depth
      of feeling and mature thought, together with the telling
      language brought to bear in working out many of those homely
      scenes upon which the heart delights to dwell, as well as
      others of a miscellaneous character.

      This book, by H. S. Battersby, the issue of which we
      announced a short time ago, has been published, and forms a
      very handsome volume. We have before referred to the
      diversified character of the poems thus collated, in fact
      several of them have appeared in our columns; suffice it now
      to say that the general topics selected are of a pleasing
      character, simple rather than striking, yet effectively
      thought out in excellent composition. As its name denotes, it
      is chiefly the mirror of home attributes, and thoughts, and
      feelings, and what is more calculated to engross the
      attention of a thoughtful mind than such irresistible
      appeals, all the more attractive from their natural bearing
      and ingenious meaning! To the lover of poetical thought the
      volume will be welcome, while the general reader will find
      much that cannot fail to interest.

      From the <i>Worcestershire Chronicle</i>, Sept. 9th, 1876.
    </center>
    <p class="indent">
      The above is an appropriate title for a volume of poems in
      which events occurring within the domestic circle are
      largely, but by no means exclusively, dealt with by the
      authoress, who explains, in a modest and brief preface, that
      the poems are published chiefly for "dear children,
      relatives, and valued friends." To many of these, no doubt,
      most of the effusions contained in this volume will have a
      personal interest, especially as the verses are written with
      much feeling and natural truth, which will be sure to elicit
      sympathy. But there are other poems which will interest the
      general reader, especially if he or she has travelled much,
      as the authoress has jotted down in verse her thoughts upon
      many of the numerous places she has visited. Amongst these is
      Malvern, with which town and the hills Mrs. Battersby seems
      particularly pleased, if not quite enthusiastic. There is "A
      Welcome to Malvern," after years of absence, which clearly
      demonstrates this; then the delightful prospect from the
      "Beacon" is discoursed upon; and, later on appear a few
      verses on "St. Ann's Well," followed by "Farewell to
      Malvern," in which, after references to the pleasant
      locality, the Abbey Church, and the Promenade Gardens, there
      occurs the following verse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And then, 'tis the home of a man of rare
      fame,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Rare talents, rare worth, Dr. G&mdash;&mdash;y,
      by name,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose wonderful skill and refinement
      combined<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Administers (<i>sic</i>) balm to the body and
      mind.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      This, we apprehend, was written and published prior to the
      disclosures in the Bravo case, in which Dr. G&mdash;&mdash;y
      cut such a very sorry figure.

      From the <i>Western Daily Mercury</i>, August 24th, 1876.
    </center>
    <p class="indent">
      We are pleased to find that a second edition of Mrs.
      Battersby's poems has been called for; they really contain
      some very excellent verse, the offspring of a mind far
      superior to that of the ordinary rhymester. We have always
      had a good deal of sympathy for the Moon and the Sea, because
      they are generally the first victims of every "poet's"
      misguided pen; it was, therefore, an intense relief to find
      that Mrs. Battersby's lyrics on these subjects are quite
      readable; indeed, the lines to the Sea are exceedingly pretty
      and full of original ideas. The volume contains a few weak
      pieces, which might have been omitted with advantage. Of
      these is a "Farewell to Malvern," from which we extract the
      following verse, as being somewhat interesting at the present
      time:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; And then, 'tis the home of a man of rare
      fame,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Rare talents, rare worth, Dr. G&mdash;&mdash;y
      by name,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose wonderful skill and refinement
      combined<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Administers balm to the body and mind.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Mrs. Battersby says she prints this book for her relatives
      and friends, and of the latter we are sure it will make a
      great number.

      HOME LYRICS, by H. S. Battersby, is a small but neat volume
      of miscellaneous poems, published by Messrs. Ward, Lock and
      Tyler, Warwick House, Paternoster Row. The authoress states
      that the poems have been written at various times and under
      various circumstances, and several of them have already
      appeared separately in the columns of journals as occasional
      contributions. The versification is good and the true spirit
      of poetry runs through the volume. Mrs. Battersby's
      descriptions of scenery in Canada as well as in this country
      are very pleasing, and the language employed is evidently
      that of a devout Christian. These HOME LYRICS should find
      their way to many hearths and hearts.

    <p class="indent">
      This is a pretty volume of poems, written, as the preface
      informs us, at various times and under different
      circumstances. They also vary in merit, but the same kindly
      sentiment runs through the whole, and they will be welcome at
      many a fireside on account of the sympathy they manifest with
      home life. In the descriptions of scenery a warm admiration
      is manifested for the beauties of nature, but the chief
      attraction of these LYRICS lies in the interest they impart
      to the ordinary incidents of life.

      It is not surprising that this handsomely got-up book of
      poetry, gilt edged, and printed on toned paper, should have
      passed into a second edition. It would be difficult to find a
      work more adapted for a "present" than Mrs. Battersby's HOME
      LYRICS; for, while far removed from those hateful goody-goody
      collections of "poetry," which perplex and distress the
      unfortunate reader, her verses are tinged with a deep,
      religious earnestness which may find an echo in any well
      balanced mind. This very earnestness, in fact, is the most
      noticeable point in the whole of the detached pieces which go
      to make up the volume. Apart from the mechanism of the
      verses, which might readily be made to work more smoothly,
      there is found a rare amount of originality in the pieces and
      an enthusiastic admiration for Nature and Nature's wonders
      which finds expression in various outbursts, more or less
      poetical. Whether singing of the "proud hills of Malvern" or
      inditing blank verse in face of the Horse Shoe Falls at
      Niagara, the author is equally at home, inasmuch as she is
      always under the influence of a keen appreciation of the
      sublimity and beauty of natural objects. The following "Hymn
      to Nature" will give an exact idea of the merits and defects
      of her style:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear Nature, how I love thee,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all thy varied forms,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Through which the God of beauty<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy loveliness adorns.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Pure fount of gushing gladness,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From spring of heavenly birth,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose living Waters flow for<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "Crowned by soft, beauteous moonbeams<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of holy, silver light,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Types of that ancient pillar<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That led the hosts by
      night&mdash;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Kissed by fond golden sunbeams<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of love-streams from on high,<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; Well may thy glad song ever<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fill the wide earth and sky."
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      To those who can enjoy the quiet and peaceful side of life
      with only an occasional glimpse of its stern realities, these
      LYRICS will be very acceptable.

The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
