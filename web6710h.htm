This term is applied in the New Testament in both a general sense
connected with a ministry of establishing and strengthening church
fellowships, as well as in a specific sense to "The 12 Apostles of
the Lamb" (Revelation 21:14).  The former category applies to a
specific ministry that continues in the Church (Ephesians 4:11-13)
and which includes many more than 12 people, while the latter refers
to the apostles named in Matthew 10:2-4, except with Judas Iscariot
replaced by Matthias (Acts 1:26).

</H2>
<P>
Baptize means to immerse in, or wash with something, usually water.
Baptism in the Holy Spirit, fire, the Body of Christ, and suffering
are also mentioned in the New Testament, along with baptism in water.
Baptism is not just to cleanse the body, but as an outward sign of an
inward spiritual cleansing and commitment. Baptism is a sign of

Christ, as practiced by Jesus' disciples.
<H2>

(which is a little more than a quart). A choenix was the daily ration
of grain for a soldier in some armies.
<H2>
 <A NAME="concubine">concubine</A>
</H2>
<P>
a woman who is united to a man for the purpose of providing him with
sexual pleasure and children, but not being honored as a full partner
in marriage; a second-class wife. In Old Testament times (and in some
places now), it was the custom of middle-eastern kings, chiefs, and
wealthy men to mary multiple wives and concubines, but God commanded
the Kings of Israel not to do so (Deuteronomy 17:17) and Jesus
encouraged people to either remain single or marry as God originally
intended: one man married to one woman (Matthew 19:3-12; 1
Corinthians 7:1-13).
<H2>

</H2>
<P>
Corban is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God.
<H2>
 <A NAME="crucify">crucify</A>
</H2>
<P>
Crucify means to execute someone by nailing them to a cross with
metal spikes. Their hands are stretched out on the crossbeam with
spikes driven through their wrists or hands. Their feet or ankles are
attached to a cross with a metal spike. The weight of the victim's
body tends to force the air out of his lungs. To raise up to breathe,
the victim has to put weight on the wounds, and use a lot of
strength. The victim is nailed to the cross while the cross is on the
ground, then the cross is raised up and dropped into a hole, thus
jarring the wounds. Before crucifiction, the victim was usually
whipped with a Roman cat of nine tails, which had bits of glass and
metal tied to its ends. This caused chunks of flesh to be removed and
open wounds to be placed against the raw wood of the cross. The
victim was made to carry the heavy crossbeam of his cross from the
place of judgment to the place of crucifixion, but often was
physically unable after the scourging, so another person would be
pressed into involuntary service to carry the cross for him. Roman
crucifixion was generally done totally naked to maximize both shame
and discomfort. Eventually, the pain, weakness, dehydration, and
exhaustion of the muscles needed to breathe make breathing
impossible, and the victim suffocates.
<H2>
 <A NAME="cubit">cubit</A>
</H2>
<P>
A cubit is a unit of linear measure, from the elbow to the tip of the
longest finger of a man. This unit is commonly converted to 0.46
meters or 18 inches, although that varies with height of the man
doing the measurement. There is also a "long" cubit that is longer
than a regular cubit by a handbreadth. (Ezekiel 43:13)
<H2>
 <A NAME="cummin">cummin</A>
</H2>
<P>
Cummin is an aromatic seed from Cuminum cyminum, resembling caraway
in flavor and appearance. It is used as a spice.
<H2>
 <A NAME="darnel">darnel</A>
</H2>
<P>
Darnel is a weed grass (probably bearded darnel or Lolium temulentum)
that looks very much like wheat until it is mature, when the seeds
reveal a great difference. Darnel seeds aren't good for much except
as chicken feed or to burn to prevent the spread of this weed.
<H2>
 <A NAME="denarii">denarii</A>
</H2>
<P>
denarii: plural form of denarius, a silver Roman coin worth about a
days wages for a laborer.
<H2>
 <A NAME="denarius">denarius</A>
</H2>
<P>
A denarius is a silver Roman coin worth about a day's wages for an
agricultural laborer. A denarius was worth 1/25th of a Roman aureus.
<H2>
 <A NAME="devil">devil</A>
</H2>
<P>
The word "devil" comes from the Greek "diabolos," which means "one
prone to slander; a liar." "Devil" is used to refer to a fallen
angel, also called "Satan," who works to steal, kill, destroy, and do
evil.  The devil's doom is certain, and it is only a matter of time
before he is thrown into the Lake of Fire, never to escape.

</H2>
<P>
"Yah" is a shortened form of "Yahweh," which is God's proper name.
This form is used occasionally in the Old Testament, mostly in the
Psalms. See "Yahweh."
<H2>
 <A NAME="Yahweh">Yahweh</A>
</H2>
<P>
"Yahweh" is God's proper name. In Hebrew, the four consonants roughly
equivalent to YHWH were considered too holy to pronounce, so the
Hebrew word for "Lord" (Adonai) was substituted when reading it
aloud. When vowel points were added to the Hebrew Old Testament, the
vowel points for "Adonai" were mixed with the consonants for
"Yahweh," which if you pronounced it literally as written, would be
pronounced "Yehovah" or "Jehovah." When the Old Testament was
translated to Greek, the tradition of substituting "Lord" for God's
proper name continued in the translation of God's name to "Lord"
(Kurios). Some English Bibles translate God's proper name to "LORD"
or "GOD" (usually with small capital letters), based on that same
tradition. This can get really confusing, since two other words
("Adonai" and "Elohim") translate to "Lord" and "God," and they are
sometimes used together. The ASV of 1901 (and some other
translations) render YHWH as "Jehovah." The most probable
pronunciation of God's proper name is "Yahweh." In Hebrew, the name
"Yahweh" is related to the active declaration "I AM." See Exodus
3:13-14. Since Hebrew has no tenses, the declaration "I AM" also
implies "I WAS" and "I WILL BE." Compare Revelation 1:8.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
