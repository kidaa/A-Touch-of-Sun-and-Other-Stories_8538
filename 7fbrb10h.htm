      Hector Macintosh was a young man about five-and-twenty, who,
      with the proclivities of the Celt, inherited also some of the
      consequent disabilities, as well as some that were
      accidental. Among the rest was a strong tendency to regard
      only the ideal, and turn away from any authority derived from
      an inferior source. His chief delight lay in the attempt to
      embody, in what seemed to him the natural form of verse, the
      thoughts in him constantly moving at least in the direction
      of the ideal, even when he was most conscious of his
      inability to attain to the utterance of them. But it was only
      in the retirement of his own chamber that he attempted their
      embodiment; of all things, he shrank from any communion
      whatever concerning these cherished matters. Nor, indeed, had
      he any friends who could tempt him to share with them what
      seemed to him his best; so that, in truth, he was intimate
      with none. His mind would dwell much upon love and friendship
      in the imaginary abstract, but of neither had he had the
      smallest immediate experience. He had cherished only the
      ideals of the purest and highest sort of either passion, and
      seemed to find satisfaction enough in the endeavor to embody
      such in his verse, without even imagining himself in
      communication with any visionary public. The era had not yet
      dawned when every scribbler is consumed with the vain
      ambition of being recognized, not, indeed, as what he is, but
      as what he pictures himself in his secret sessions of
      thought. That disease could hardly attack him while yet his
      very imaginations recoiled from the thought of the inimical
      presence of a stranger consciousness. Whether this was
      modesty, or had its hidden base in conceit, I am, with the
      few insights I have had into his mind, unable to determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he had leisure for the indulgence of his bent was the
      result of his peculiar position. He lived in the house of his
      father, and was in his father's employment, so that he was
      able both to accommodate himself to his father's requirements
      and at the same time fully indulge his own especial taste.
      The elder Macintosh was a banker in one of the larger county
      towns of Scotland&#8212;at least, such is the profession and
      position there accorded by popular consent to one who is, in
      fact, only a bank-agent, for it is a post involving a good
      deal of influence and a yet greater responsibility. Of this
      responsibility, however, he had allowed his son to feel
      nothing, merely using him as a clerk, and leaving him, as
      soon as the stated hour for his office-work expired, free in
      mind as well as body, until the new day should make a fresh
      claim upon his time and attention. His mother seldom saw him
      except at meals, and, indeed, although he always behaved
      dutifully to her, there was literally no intercommunion of
      thought or feeling between them&#8212;a fact which probably
      had a good deal to do with the undeveloped condition in which
      Hector found, or rather, did not find himself. Occasionally
      his mother wanted him to accompany her for a call, but he
      avoided yielding as much as possible, and generally with
      success; for this was one of the claims of social convention
      against which he steadily rebelled&#8212;the more
      determinedly that in none of his mother's friends could he
      take the smallest interest; for she was essentially a
      commonplace because ambitious woman, without a spark of
      aspiration, and her friends were of the same sort, without
      regard for anything but what was&#8212;or, at least, they
      supposed to be&#8212;the fashion. Indeed, it was hard to
      understand how Hector came ever to be born of such a woman,
      although in truth she was of as pure Celtic origin as her
      husband&#8212;only blood is not spirit, and that is often
      clearly manifest. His father, on the other hand, was not
      without some signs of an imagination&#8212;quite undeveloped,
      indeed, and, I believe, suppressed by the requirements of his
      business relations. At the same time, Hector knew that he
      cherished not a little indignation against the insolence of
      the good Dr. Johnson in regard to both Ossian and his humble
      translator, Macpherson, upholding the genuineness of both,
      although unable to enter into and set forth the points of the
      argument on either side. As to Hector, he reveled in the
      ancient traditions of his family, and not unfrequently in his
      earlier youth had made an attempt to re-embody some of its
      legends into English, vain as regarded the retention of the
      special airiness and suggestiveness of their vaguely showing
      symbolism, for often he dropped his pen with a sigh of
      despair at the illusiveness of the special aroma of the
      Celtic imagination. For the rest, he had had as good an
      education as Scotland could in those days afford him, one of
      whose best features was the negative one that it did not at
      all interfere with the natural course of his inborn
      tendencies, and merely developed the power of expressing
      himself in what manner he might think fit. Let me add that he
      had a good conscience&#8212;I mean, a conscience ready to
      give him warning of the least tendency to overstep any line
      of prohibition; and that, as yet, he had never consciously
      refused to attend to such warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing I must mention is that, although his mind was
      constantly haunted by imaginary forms of loveliness, he had
      never yet been what is called <i>in love</i>. For he had
      never yet seen anyone who even approached his idea of
      spiritual at once and physical attraction. He was content to
      live and wait, without even the notion that he was waiting
      for anything. He went on writing his verses, and receiving
      the reward, such as it was, of having placed on record the
      thoughts which had come to him, so that he might at will
      recall them. Neither had he any thought of the mental soil
      which was thus slowly gathering for the possible growth of an
      unknown seed, fit for growing and developing in that same
      unknown soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day there arrived in that cold Northern city a certain
      cold, sunshiny morning, gay and sparkling, and with it the
      beginning of what, for want of a better word, we may call his
      fate. He knew nothing of its approach, had not the slightest
      prevision that the divinity had that moment put his hand to
      the shaping of his rough-hewn ends. It was early October by
      the calendar, but leaves brown and spotted and dry lay
      already in little heaps on the pavement&#8212;heaps made and
      unmade continually, as if for the sport of the keen wind that
      now scattered them with a rush, and again, extemporizing a
      little evanescent whirlpool, gathered a fresh heap upon the
      flags, again to rush asunder, as in direst terror of the
      fresh-invading wind, determined yet again to scatter them, a
      broken rout of escaping fugitives. Along the pavement,
      seemingly in furtherance of the careless design of the wind,
      a girl went heedlessly scushling along among the unresting
      and unresisting leaves, making with her rather short skirt a
      mimic whirlwind of her own. Her eyes were fixed on the
      ground, and she seemed absorbed in anxious thought, which
      thought had its origin in one of the commonest causes of
      human perplexity&#8212;the need of money, and the
      impossibility of devising a scheme by which to procure any.
      It was but a few weeks since her father had died, leaving
      behind him such a scanty provision for his widow and child
      that only by the utmost care and coaxing were they able from
      the first to make it meet their necessities. Nor, indeed,
      would it have been possible for them to subsist had not a
      brother of the widow supplemented their poor resources with
      an uncertain contingent, whose continuance he was not able to
      secure, or even dared to promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the present moment, however, it was not anxiety as to
      their own affairs that occupied the mind of Annie Melville,
      near enough as that might have lain; it was the unhappy
      condition in which the imprudence of a
      school-friend&#8212;almost her only friend&#8212;had involved
      herself by her hasty marriage with a man who, up to the
      present moment, had shown no faculty for helping himself or
      the wife he had involved in his fate, and who did not know
      where or by what means to procure even the bread of which
      they were in immediate want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Annie had never had to suffer hunger, and the idea that
      her companion from childhood should be exposed to such a fate
      was what she could not bear. Yet, for any way out of it she
      could see, it would have to be borne. She might possibly, by
      herself going without, have given her a good piece of bread;
      but then she would certainly share it with her foolish
      husband, and there would be little satisfaction in that! They
      had already arrived at a stage in their downward progress
      when not gold, or even silver, but bare copper, was lacking
      as the equivalent for the bread that could but keep them
      alive until the next rousing of the hunger that even now lay
      across their threshold. And how could she, in her all but
      absolute poverty, do anything? Her mother was but one pace or
      so from the same goal, and would, as a mother must, interfere
      to prevent her useless postponement of the inevitable. It was
      clear she could do nothing&#8212;and yet she could ill
      consent that it should be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her father almost suddenly left them alone, Annie was
      already acting as assistant in the Girls' High
      School&#8212;but, alas! without any recognition of her
      services by even a promise of coming payment. She lived only
      in the hope of a small salary, dependent on her definite
      appointment to the office. To attempt to draw upon this hope
      would be to imperil the appointment itself. She could not,
      even for her friend, risk her mother's prospects, already
      poor enough; and she could not help perceiving the
      hopelessness of her friend's case, because of the utter
      characterlessness of the husband to whom she was enslaved.
      Why interfere with the hunger he would do nothing to
      forestall? How could she even give such a man the sixpence
      which had been her father's last gift to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Annie was one to whom, in the course of her life,
      something strange had not unfrequently happened, chiefly in
      the shape of what the common mind would set aside as mere
      coincidence. I do not say <i>many</i> such things had
      occurred in her life; but, together, their strangeness and
      their recurrence had caused her to remember every one of
      them, so that, when she reviewed them, they seemed to her
      many. And now, with a shadowy prevision, as it seemed, that
      something was going to happen, and with a shadowy
      recollection that she had known beforehand it was coming,
      something strange did take place. Of such things she used, in
      after days, always to employ the old, stately Bible-phrase,
      "It came to pass"; she never said, "It happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she walked along with her eyes on the ground, the withered
      leaves caught up every now and then in a wild dance by the
      frolicsome wind, she was suddenly aware of something among
      them which she could not identify, whirling in the aerial
      vortex about her feet. Scarcely caring what it was, she yet,
      all but mechanically, looked at it a little closer, lost it
      from sight, caught it again, as a fresh blast sent it once
      more gyrating about her feet, and now regarded it more
      steadfastly. Even then it looked like nothing but another
      withered leaf, brown and wrinkled, given over to the wind,
      and rustling along at its mercy. Yet it made an impression
      upon her so far unlike that of a leaf that for a moment more
      she fixed on it a still keener look of unconsciously
      expectant eyes, and saw only that it looked&#8212;perhaps a
      little larger than most of the other leaves, but as brown and
      dead as they. Almost the same instant, however, she turned
      and pounced upon it, and, the moment she handled it, became
      aware that it felt less crumbly and brittle than the others
      looked, and then saw clearly that it was not a leaf, but
      perhaps a rag, or possibly a piece of soiled and rumpled
      paper. With a curiosity growing to expectation, and in a
      moment to wondering recognition, she proceeded to uncrumple
      it carefully and smooth it out tenderly; nor was the process
      quite completed when she fell upon her knees on the cold
      flags, her little cloak flowing wide from the clasp at her
      neck in a yet wilder puff of the bitter wind; but suddenly
      remembering that she must not be praying in the sight of men,
      started again to her feet, and, wrapping her closed hand
      tight in the scanty border of her cloak, hurried, with the
      pound-note she had rescued, to the friend whose need was
      sorer than her own&#8212;not without an undefined anxiety in
      her heart whether she was doing right. How much good the note
      did, or whether it merely fell into the bottomless gulf of
      irremediable loss, I cannot tell. Annie's friend and her
      shiftless mate at once changed their dirty piece of paper for
      silver, bought food and railway tickets, left the town, and
      disappeared entirely from her horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But consequences were not over with Annie; and the next day
      she became acquainted with the fact that proved of great
      significance to her, namely, that the same evening she found
      the money, Mr. Macintosh's kitchen-chimney had been on fire;
      and it wanted but the knowledge of how this had taken place
      to change the girl's consciousness from that of one specially
      aided by the ministry of an angel to that of a young woman,
      honest hitherto, suddenly changed into a thief!
    </p>
    <p>
      For, in the course of a certain friendly gossip's narrative,
      it came out that that night the banker had been using the
      kitchen fire for the destruction of an accumulation of
      bank-notes, the common currency of Scotland, which had been
      judged altogether too dirty, or too much dilapidated, to be
      reissued. The knowledge of this fact was the slam of the
      closing door, whereby Annie found her soul shut out to wander
      in a night of dismay. The woman who told the fact saw nothing
      of consequence in it; Mrs. Melville, to whom she was telling
      it, saw nothing but perhaps a lesson on the duty of having
      chimneys regularly swept, because of the danger to
      neighboring thatch. But had not Annie been seated in the
      shadow, her ghastly countenance would, even to the most
      casual glance, have betrayed a certain guilty horror, for now
      she <i>knew</i> that she had found and given away what she
      ought at once to have handed back to its rightful owner. It
      was true he did not even know that he had lost it, and could
      have no suspicion that she had found it; but what difference
      did or could that make? It was true also that she had neither
      taken nor bestowed it to her own advantage; but again, what
      difference could that make in her duty to restore it? Did she
      not well remember how eloquently and precisely Mr. Kennedy
      had, the very last Sunday, expounded the passage, "Thou shalt
      not respect the person of the poor." Right was right,
      whatever soft-hearted people might say or think. Anyone might
      give what was his own, but who could be right in giving away
      what was another's? It was time she had done it without
      thinking; but she had known, or might have known, well enough
      that to whomsoever it might belong, it was not hers. And now
      what possibility was there of setting right what she had set
      wrong? It was just possible a day might come when she should
      be able to restore what she had unjustly taken, but at the
      present moment it was as impossible for her to lay her hand
      upon a pound-note as upon a million. And, terrible
      thought!&#8212;she might have to enter the presence of her
      father&#8212;dead, men called him, but alive she knew
      him&#8212;with the consciousness that she had not brought him
      back the honor he had left with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will, of course, suggest itself to every reader that
      herein she was driving her sense of obligation to the verge
      of foolishness; and, indeed, the thought did not fail to
      occur even to herself; but the answer of the self-accusing
      spirit was that had she been thoroughly upright in heart, she
      would at once have gone to the nearest house and made such
      inquiry as must instantly have resulted in the discovery of
      what had happened. This she had omitted&#8212;without
      thought, it is true, but not, therefore, without blame; and
      now, so far as she could tell, she would never be able to
      make restitution! Had she even told her mother what befallen
      her, her mother might have thought of the way in which it had
      come to pass, and set her feet in the path of her duty! But
      she had made evil haste, and had compassed too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found herself, in truth, in a sore predicament, and was
      on the point of starting to her feet to run and confess to
      Mr. Macintosh what she had done, that he might at once
      pronounce the penalty on what she never doubted he must
      regard as a case of simple theft; but she bethought herself
      that she would remain incapable of offering the least
      satisfaction, and must therefore be regarded merely as one
      who sought by confession to secure forgiveness and remission.
      What proof had she to offer even that she had given the money
      away? To mention the name of her friend would be to bring her
      into discredit, and transfer to her the blame of her own act.
      There was nothing she could do&#8212;and yet, however was she
      to go about with such a load upon her conscience? Confessing,
      she might at least be regarded as one who desired and meant
      to be honest. Confession would, anyhow, ease the weight of
      her load. Passively at last, from very weariness of thought,
      her mind was but going backward and forward over its own
      traces, heedlessly obliterating them, when suddenly a new and
      horrid consciousness emerged from the trodden slime&#8212;
      that she was glad that at least Sophy <i>had</i> the money!
      For one passing moment she was glad with the joy of Lady
      Macbeth, that what was done was done, and could not be
      altered. Then once more the storm within her awoke and would
      not again be stilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now a third something happened which brought with it
      hope, for it suggested a way of deliverance. Impelled by the
      same power that causes a murderer to haunt the scene of his
      violence, she left the house, and was unaware whither she was
      directing her steps until she found herself again passing the
      door of the banker's house; there, in that same
      kitchen-window, on a level with the pavement, she espied, in
      large pen-drawn print, the production apparently of the cook
      or another of the servants, the announcement that a
      parlor-maid was wanted immediately. Again without waiting to
      think, and only afterwards waking up to the fact and meaning
      of what she had done, she turned, went back to the
      entry-door, and knocked. It was almost suddenly opened by the
      cook, and at once the storm of her misery was assuaged in a
      rising moon of hope, and the night became light about her.
      Ah, through what miseries are not even frail hopes our best
      and safest, our only <i>true</i> guides indeed, into other
      and yet fairer hopes!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you want to see the mistress?" asked the jolly-faced
      cook, where she stood on the other side of the threshold;
      and, without waiting an answer, she turned and led the way to
      the parlor. Annie followed, as if across the foundation of
      the fallen wall of Jericho; and found, to her surprise, that
      Mrs. Macintosh, knowing her by sight, received her with
      condescension, and Annie, grateful for the good-humor which
      she took for kindness, told her simply that she had come to
      see whether she would accept her services as parlor-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Macintosh seemed surprised at the proposal, and asked
      her the natural question whether she had ever occupied a
      similar situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie answered she had not, but that at home, while her
      father was alive, she had done so much of the same sort that
      she believed she could speedily learn all that was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought someone told me," said the lady, who was one of
      the greatest gossips in the town, "that you were one of the
      teachers in the High School?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true," answered Annie; "I was doing so upon
      probation; but I had not yet begun to receive any salary for
      it. I was only a sort of apprentice to the work, and under no
      engagement."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Macintosh, after regarding Annie for some time, and
      taking silent observation of her modesty and good-breeding,
      said at last:

    <p>
      "I like the look of you, Miss&#8212;, Miss&#8212;&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Annie Melville."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Annie, I confess I do not indeed <i>see</i> anything
      particularly unsuitable in you, but at the same time I cannot
      help fearing you may be&#8212;or, I should say rather, may
      imagine yourself&#8212;superior to what may be required of
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, ma'am!" answered Annie; "I assure you I am too poor
      to think of any such thing! Indeed, I am so anxious to make
      money at once that, if you would consent to give me a trial,
      I should be ready to come to you this very evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have no wages before the end of your six months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a risk to take you without a character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry, ma'am; but I have no one that can vouch for
      me&#8212;except, indeed, Mrs. Slater, of the High School,
      would say a word in my favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well!" answered Mrs. Macintosh, "I am so far pleased
      with you that I do not think I can be making a <i>great</i>
      mistake if I merely give you a trial. You may come to-night,
      if you like&#8212;that is, with your mother's permission."
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie ran home greatly relieved, and told her mother what a
      piece of good-fortune she had had. Mrs. Melville did not at
      all take to the idea at first, for she cherished undefined
      expections for Annie, and knew that her father had done so
      also, for the girl was always reading, and had been for years
      in the habit of reading aloud to him, making now and then a
      remark that showed she understood well what she read. So the
      mother took comfort in her disappointment that her child had,
      solely for her sake, she supposed, betaken herself to such
      service as would at once secure her livelihood and bring her
      in a little money, for, with the shadow of coming want
      growing black above them, even her first half-year's wages
      was a point of hope and expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Annie," she answered, after a few moments'
      consideration, "it is but for a time; and you will be able to
      give up the place as soon as you please, and the easier that
      she only takes you on trial; that will hold for you as well
      as for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing was farther from Annie's intention than finding
      the place would not suit her: no change could she dream of
      before at least she had a pound-note in her hand, when at
      once she would make it clear to her mother what a terrible
      scare had driven her to the sudden step she had taken. Until
      then she must go about with her whole head sick and her whole
      heart faint; neither could she for many weeks rid herself of
      the haunting notion that the banker, who was chiefly affected
      by her crime,&#8212;for as such she fully believed and
      regarded her deed,&#8212;was fully aware of her guilt. It
      seemed to her, when at any moment he happened to look at her,
      that now at last he must be on the point of letting her know
      that he had read the truth in her guilty looks, and she
      constantly fancied him saying to himself, "That is the girl
      who stole my money; she feels my eyes upon her." Every time
      she came home from an errand she would imagine her master
      looking from the window of his private room on the first
      floor, in readiness to cast aside forbearance and denounce
      her: he was only waiting to make himself one shade surer! Ah,
      how long was the time she had to await her cleansing, the
      moment when she could go to him and say, "I have wronged, I
      have robbed you; here is all I can do to show my repentance.
      All this time I have been but waiting for my wages, to repay
      what I had taken from you." And, oddly enough, she was always
      mixing herself up with the man in the parable, who had
      received from his master a pound to trade with and make more;
      from her dreams she would wake in terror at the sound of that
      master's voice, ordering the pound to be taken from her and
      given to the school-fellow whom, at the cost of her own
      honesty, she had befriended. Oh, joyous day when the doom
      should be lifted from her, and she set free, to dream no
      more! For surely, when at length her master knew all, with
      the depth of her sorrow and repentance, he could not refuse
      his forgiveness! Would he not even, she dared to hope, remit
      the interest due on his money?&#8212;of which she
      entertained, in her ignorance, a usurious and preposterous
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days went on, and the hour of her deliverance drew nigh.
      But, long before it came, two other processes had been slowly
      arriving at maturity. She had been gaining the confidence of
      her mistress, so that, ere three months were over, the
      arrangement of all minor matters of housekeeping was entirely
      in her hands. It may be that Mrs. Macintosh was not a little
      lazy, nor sorry to leave aside whatever did not positively
      demand her personal attention; one thing I am sure of, that
      Annie never made the smallest attempt to gain this favor, if
      such it was. Her mistress would, for instance, keep losing
      the keys of the cellaret, until in despair she at last
      yielded them entirely to the care of Annie, who thereafter
      carried them in her pocket, where they were always at hand
      when wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other result was equally natural, but of greater
      importance; Hector, the only child of the house, was
      gradually and, for a long time, unconsciously falling in love
      with Annie. Those friends of the family who liked Annie, and
      felt the charm of her manners and simplicity, said only that
      his mother had herself to blame, for what else could she
      expect? Others of them, regarding her from the same point of
      view as her mistress, repudiated the notion as absurd, saying
      Hector was not the man to degrade himself! He was incapable
      of such a misalliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as I have said already, Hector, although he had never
      yet been in love, was yet more than usually ready to fall in
      love, as belongs to the poetic temperament, when the fit
      person should appear. As to what sort she might prove
      depended on two facts in Hector&#8212;one, that he was
      fastidious in the best meaning of the word, and the other
      that he was dominated by sound good sense; a fact which even
      his father allowed, although with a grudge, seeing he had
      hitherto manifested no devotion to business, but spent his
      free time in literary pursuits. Of the special nature of
      those pursuits his father knew, or cared to know, nothing;
      and as to his mother, she had not even a favorite hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may say, then, that the love of womankind, which in
      solution, so to speak, pervaded every atomic interstice of
      the nature of Hector, had gradually, indeed, but yet rapidly,
      concentrated and crystallized around the idea of
      Annie&#8212;the more homogeneously and absorbingly that she
      was the first who had so moved him. It was, indeed, in the
      case of each a first love, although in the case of neither
      love at first sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost from the hour when first Annie entered the family,
      Hector had looked on her with eyes of interest; but, for a
      time, she had gone about the house with a sense almost of
      being there upon false pretenses, for she knew that she was
      doing what she did from no regard to any of its members, but
      only to gain the money whose payment would relieve her from
      an ever-present consciousness of guilt; and for this cause,
      if for no other, she was not in danger of falling in love
      with Hector. She was, indeed, too full of veneration for her
      master and mistress, and for their son so immeasurably above
      her, to let her thoughts rest upon him in any but a distantly
      worshipful fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was part of her duty, which was not over well-defined
      in the house, to see that her young master's room was kept
      tidy and properly dusted; and in attending to this it was
      unavoidable that she should come upon indications of the way
      in which he spent his leisure hours. Never dreaming, indeed,
      that a servant might recognize at a glance what his father
      and mother did not care to know, Hector was never at any
      pains to conceal, or even to lay aside the lines yet wet from
      his pen when he left the room; and Annie could not help
      seeing them, or knowing what they were. Like many another
      Scotch lassie, she was fonder of reading than of anything
      else; and in her father's house she had had the free use of
      what books were in it; nor is it, then, to be wondered at
      that she was far more familiar with certain great books than
      was ever many an Oxford man. Some never read what they have
      no desire to assimilate; and some read what no expenditure of
      reading could ever make them able to appropriate; but Annie
      read, understood, and re-read the "Paradise Lost"; knew
      intimately "Comus" as well; delighted in "Lycidas," and had
      some of Milton's sonnets by heart; while for the Hymn on the
      Nativity, she knew every line, had studied every turn and
      phrase in it. It is sometimes a great advantage not to have
      many books, and so never outgrow the sense of mystery that
      hovers about even an open book-case; it was with awe and
      reverence that Annie, looking around Hector's room, saw in
      it, not daring to touch them, books she had heard of, but
      never seen&#8212;among others a Shakspere in one thick volume
      lay open on his table; nor is it, then, surprising that, when
      putting his papers straight, she could not help seeing from
      the different lengths of the lines upon them that they were
      verse. She trembled and glowed at the very sight of them, for
      she had in herself the instinct of sacred numbers, and in her
      soul felt a vague hunger after what might be contained in
      those loose papers&#8212;into which she did not even peep,
      instinctively knowing it dishonorable. She trembled yet more
      at recognizing the beautiful youth in the same house with
      her, to whom she did service, as himself one of those gifted
      creatures whom most she revered&#8212;a poet, perhaps another
      such as Milton! Neither are all ladies, nor all servants of
      ladies, honorable like Annie, or fit as she to be left alone
      with a man's papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector knew very well how his mother would regard such an
      alliance as had now begun to absorb every desire and thought
      of his heart, and was the more careful to watch and repress
      every sign of the same, foreseeing that, at the least
      suspicion of the fact, she would lay all the blame upon
      Annie, at once dismiss her from the house, and remain forever
      convinced that she had entered it with the design in her
      heart to make him fall in love with her. He therefore avoided
      ever addressing her, except with a distant civility, the
      easier to him that his mind was known only to himself, while
      all the time the consciousness of her presence in it
      enveloped the house in a rosy cloud. For a long time he did
      not even dream of attempting a word with her alone, fondly
      imagining that thus he gave his mother time to know and love
      Annie before discovering anything between them to which she
      might object. But he did not yet know how incapable that
      mother was of any simple affection, being, indeed, one of the
      commonest-minded of women. He believed also that the least
      attempt to attract Annie's attention would but scare her, and
      make her incapable of listening to what he might try to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Annie, under the influence of more and
      better food, and that freedom from care which came of the
      consciousness that she was doing her best both for her mother
      and for her own moral emancipation, looked sweeter and grew
      happier every day; no cloudy sense, no doubt of approaching
      danger had yet begun to heave an ugly shoulder above her
      horizon, neither had Hector begun to fret against the feeling
      that he must not speak to her; in such a silence and in such
      a presence he felt he could live happy for ages; he moved in
      a lovely dream of still content.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was natural also that he should begin to burgeon
      spiritually and mentally, to grow and flourish beyond any
      experience in the past. Within a few such days of hidden
      happiness, the power of verse, and of thoughts worthy of
      verse, came upon him with as sure an inspiration of the
      Almighty as can ever descend upon a man, accompanied by a
      deeper sense of the being and the presence of God, and a
      stronger desire to do the will of the Father, which is surely
      the best thing God himself can kindle in the heart of any
      man. For what good is there in creation but the possibility
      of being yet further created? And what else is growth but
      more of the will of God?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something fresh began to stir in his mind; even as in the
      spring, away in far depths of beginning, the sap gives its
      first upward throb in the tree, and the first bud, as yet
      invisible, begins to jerk itself forward to break from the
      cerements of ante-natal quiescence, and become a growing
      leaf, so a something in Hector that was his very life and
      soul began to yield to unseen creative impulse, and throb
      with a dim, divine consciousness. The second evening after
      thus recognizing its presence he hurried up the stair from
      the office to his own room, and there, sitting down, began to
      write&#8212;not a sonnet to his charmer, neither any dream
      about her, not even some sweet song of the waking spring
      which he felt moving within him, but the first speech of a
      dramatic poem. It was a bold beginning, but all beginners are
      daring, if not presumptuous. Hector's aim was to embody an
      ideal of check, of rousing, of revival, of new energy and
      fresh start. All that evening he wrote with running pen,
      forgot the dinner-bell after its first summons, and went on
      until Annie knocked at his door, dispatched to summon him to
      the meal. There was in Hector, indeed, as a small part of the
      world came by-and-by to know, the making of a real poet, for
      such there are in the world at all times&#8212;yea, even
      now&#8212;although they may not be recognized, or even
      intended to ripen in the course of one human season. I think
      Annie herself was one of such&#8212;so full was she of
      receptive and responsive faculty in the same kind, and I
      remain in doubt whether the genuine enjoyment of verse be not
      a fuller sign of the presence of what is most valuable in it
      than even some power of producing it. For Hector, I imagine,
      it gave strong proof of his being a poet indeed that, when he
      opened the door to her knock, the appearance of Annie
      herself, instead of giving him a thrill of pleasure,
      occasioned him a little annoyance by the evanishment of a
      just culminating train of thought into the vast and seething
      void, into which he gazed after it in vain. And Annie
      herself, although all the time in Hector's thought, revealed
      herself only, after the custom of celestials, at the very
      moment of her disappearance; her message delivered, she went
      back to her duties at the table; and then first Hector woke
      to the knowledge that she had been at his door, and was there
      no more. During the last few days he had been gradually
      approaching the resolve to keep silence no longer, but be
      bold and tell Annie how full his heart was of her. One moment
      he might have done so; one moment more, and he could not!
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed close upon her steps, but not a word with her was
      possible, and it seemed to Hector that she sped from him like
      a very wraith to avoid his addressing her. Had she, then, he
      asked himself, some dim suspicion of his feelings toward her,
      or was she but making haste from a sense of propriety?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that very morning Mrs. Macintosh had been talking kindly
      to Annie&#8212;as kindly, that is, as her abominable
      condescension would permit&#8212;and, what to Annie was of
      far greater consequence, had paid her her wages, rather more
      than she had expected, so that nothing now lay between her
      and the fall of her burden from her heavy-laden conscience,
      except, indeed, her preliminary confession. Dinner,
      therefore, being over, her mistress gone to the drawing room
      to prepare the coffee, and her master to his room to write a
      letter suddenly remembered, Hector was left alone with Annie.
      Whereupon followed an amusing succession of disconnected
      attempt and frustration. For no sooner had Mr. Macintosh left
      the room than Annie darted from it after him, and Hector
      darted after Annie, determined at length to speak to her.
      When Annie, however, reached the foot of the stair, her
      master was already up the first flight, and Annie's courage
      failing her, she, turning sharply round, almost ran against
      Hector, who was close behind her. The look of disappointment
      on her face, to the meaning of which he had no clew,
      quenching his courage next, he returned in silence to the
      dining room, where Annie was now hovering aimlessly about the
      table, until, upon his re-entrance, she settled herself
      behind Hector's chair. He turned half-round, and would have
      said something to her, but, seeing her pale and troubled, he
      lapsed into a fit of brooding, and no longer dared speak to
      her. Besides, his mother might come to the dining room at any
      moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Annie, thinking she heard her master's re-descending
      step, hurried again from the room; but only at once to return
      afresh, which set Hector wondering yet more. Why on earth
      should she be lying in ambush for his father? He did not know
      that she was equally anxious to avoid the eyes of her
      mistress. And while Annie was anxious to keep her secret from
      the tongue of Mrs. Macintosh, Hector was as anxious to keep
      his from the eyes of his mother until a fit moment should
      arrive for its disclosure. But he imagined, I believe, that
      Annie saw he wanted to speak to her, and thought she was
      doing what she could to balk his intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the necessity for disclosure was strongest in Annie, and
      drove her to encounter what risk might be involved. So when
      at last she heard a certain step of the stair creak, she
      darted to the door, and left the room even while the hand of
      her mistress, coming to say the coffee was ready, was on that
      which communicated with the drawing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I heard Annie at the sideboard: is she gone?" she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She left the room this moment, I believe," answered Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is she gone for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say, mother," replied Hector indifferently, in the
      act himself of leaving the room also, determined on yet
      another attempt to speak to Annie. In the meantime, however,
      Annie had found her opportunity. She had met Mr. Macintosh
      halfway down the last flight of stairs, and had lifted to him
      such a face of entreaty that he listened at once to her
      prayer for a private interview, and, turning, led the way up
      again to the room he had just left. There he shut the door,
      and said to her pleasantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Annie, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid his man-imagination had led him to anticipate
      some complaint against Hector: he certainly was nowise
      prepared for what the poor self-accusing girl had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one moment she stood unable to begin; the next she had
      recovered her resolution: her face filled with a sudden glow;
      and ere her master had time to feel shocked, she was on her
      knees at his feet, holding up to him a new pound-note, one of
      those her mistress had just given her. Familiar, however, as
      her master was with the mean-looking things in which lay
      almost all his dealings, he did not at first recognize the
      object she offered him; while what connection with his wife's
      parlor-maid it could represent was naturally inconceivable to
      him. He stood for a moment staring at the note, and then
      dropped a pair of dull, questioning eyes on the face of the
      kneeling girl. He was not a man of quick apprehension, and
      the situation was appallingly void of helpful suggestion. To
      make things yet more perplexing, Annie sobbed as if her heart
      would break, and was unable to utter a word. "What must a
      stranger imagine," the poor man thought, "to come upon such a
      tableau?" Her irrepressible emotion lasted so long that he
      lost his patience and turned upon her, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must call your mistress; she will know what to do with
      you!" Instantly she sprang to her feet, and broke into
      passionate entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please, <i>please</i>, sir, have a minute's patience
      with me," she cried; "you never saw me behave so badly
      before!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not, Annie; I never did. And I hope you will never
      do so again," answered her master, with reviving good-nature,
      and was back in his first notion, that Hector had said
      something to her which she thought rude and did not like to
      repeat. He had never had a daughter, and perhaps all the more
      felt pitiful over the troubled woman-child at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, having once spoken out and conquered the spell upon her,
      Annie was able to go on. She became suddenly quiet, and,
      interrupted only by an occasional sob, poured out her whole
      story, if not quite unbrokenly, at least without actual
      intermission, while her master stood and listened without a
      break in his fixed attention. By-and-by, however, a slow
      smile began to dawn on his countenance, which spread and
      spread until at length he burst into a laugh, none the less
      merry that it was low and evidently restrained lest it should
      be overheard. Like one suddenly made ashamed, Annie rose to
      her feet, but still held out the note to her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was it possible that her evil deed should provoke her
      master to a fit of laughter? It might be easy for him in his
      goodness to pardon her, but how could he treat her offense as
      a thing of no consequence? Was it not a sin, which, like
      every other sin, could nowise at all be cleansed? For even
      God himself could not blot out the fact that she had done the
      deed! And yet, there stood her master laughing! And, what was
      more dreadful still, despite the resentment of her
      conscience, her master's merriment so far affected herself
      that she could not repress a responsive smile! It was no less
      than indecent, and yet, even in that answering smile, her
      misery of six months' duration passed totally away, melted
      from her like a mist of the morning, so that she could not
      even recall the feeling of her lost unhappiness. But, might
      not her conscience be going to sleep? Was it not possible she
      might be growing indifferent to right and wrong? Was she not
      aware in herself that there were powers of evil about her,
      seeking to lead her astray, and putting strange and horrid
      things in her mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      But, although he laughed, her master uttered no articulate
      sound until she had ended her statement, by which time his
      amusement had changed to admiration. Another minute still
      passed, however, before he knew what answer to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my good girl," he began, "I do not see that you have
      anything to blame yourself for&#8212;at least, not anything
      <i>worth</i> blaming yourself about. After so long a time,
      the money found was certainly your own, and you could do what
      you pleased with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sir, I did not wait at all to see how it had happened,
      or whether it might not be claimed. I believe, indeed, that I
      hurried away at once, lest anyone should know I had it. I ran
      to spend it at once, so for whatever happened afterward I was
      to blame. Then, when it was too late, I learned that the
      money was yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do with it, if I may ask?" said the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gave it to a school-fellow of mine who had married a
      helpless sort of husband and was in want of food."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid you did not help them much by that," murmured
      the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir, I knew no other way to help them; and the money
      seemed to have been given me for them. I soon came to know
      better, and have been sorry ever since. I knew that I had no
      right to give it away as soon as I knew whose it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, but still held out the note to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Macintosh stood again silent, and made no movement toward
      taking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir, take the money, and forgive me," pleaded Annie.
      "And please, sir, <i>please</i> do not say anything about it
      to anybody. Even my mother does not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now there you did wrong. You ought to have told your
      mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see that now, sir; but I was so glad to be able to help
      the poor creatures that I did not think of it till
      afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say your mother would have been glad of the money
      herself; I understand she was not left very well off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At that time I did not know she was so poor. But now that my
      mistress has paid me such good wages, I am going to take her
      every penny of them this very afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then you will tell her, will you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not mind telling her when you have taken it back. I
      was afraid to tell her before! It was to pay you back that I
      asked Mrs. Macintosh to take me for parlor-maid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you were not in service before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. You see, my mother thought I could earn my bread in
      a way we should both like better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So now you will give up service and go back to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure, sir. It would be long, I fear, before the
      school would pay me as well. You see, I have my food here
      too. And everything tells. Please, sir, take the pound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear girl," said her master, "I could not think of
      depriving you of what you have so well earned. It is more
      than enough to me that you want to repay it. I positively
      cannot take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I do want to repay it, sir," rejoined Annie. "It's
      anything but willing I shall be <i>not</i> to repay it.
      Indeed, there is no other way to get my soul free."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it seems time I should mention that Hector, weary of
      waiting Annie's return, had left the dining room to look for
      her; and running up the stair, not without the dread of
      hearing his mother's foot behind him, had slid softly into
      his father's room, to find Annie on her knees before him, and
      hear enough to understand her story before either his father
      or she was aware of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, sir, but indeed you must take it," urged
      Annie. "Surely you would not be so cruel to a poor girl who
      prays you to take the guilt off her back. Don't you see, sir,
      I never can look my father in the face till I have paid the
      money back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here his father caught sight of Hector, and, perceiving that
      Annie had not yet seen him, and possibly glad of a witness,
      put up his hand to him to keep still. "Where is your father,
      then?" he asked Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In heaven somewhere," she answered, "waiting for my mother
      and me. Oh, father!" she broke out, "if only you had been
      alive you would soon have got me out of my shame and misery!
      But, thank God! it will soon be over now; my master cannot
      refuse to set me free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I will set you free," said Mr. Macintosh, a good
      deal touched. "With all my heart I forgive you
      the&#8212;the&#8212;the debt, and I thank you for bringing me
      to know the honestest girl&#8212;I mean, the most honorable
      girl I have ever yet had the pleasure to meet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector had been listening, hardly able to contain his
      delight, and at these last words of his father, like the
      blundering idiot he was, he rushed forward, and, clasping
      Annie to his heart, cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God, Annie, my father at least knows what you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He met with a rough and astounding check. Far too startled to
      see who it was that thus embraced her, and unprepared to
      receive such a salutation, least of all from one she had
      hitherto regarded as the very prince of gentleness and
      courtesy, she met it with a sound, ringing box on the ear,
      which literally staggered Hector, and sent his father into a
      second peal of laughter, this time as loud as it was merry,
      and the next moment swelled in volume by that of Hector
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Annie!" he cried. "I never should have thought
      you could hit so hard. But, indeed, I beg your pardon. I
      forgot myself and you too when I behaved so badly. But I'm
      not sorry, father, after all, for that box on the ear has got
      me over a difficult task, and compelled me to speak out at
      once what has been long in my mind, but which I had not the
      courage to say. Annie," he went on, turning to her, and
      standing humbly before her, "I have long loved you; if you
      will do me the honor to marry me, I am yours the moment you
      say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Annie's surprise and the hasty act she had committed in
      the first impulse of defense had so reacted upon her in a
      white dismay that she stood before him speechless and almost
      ready to drop. Awakening from what was fast growing a mere
      dream of offense to the assured consciousness of another
      offense almost as flagrant, she stared as if she had suddenly
      opened her eyes on a whole Walpurgisnacht of demons and
      witches, while Hector, recovering from his astonishment to
      the lively delight of having something to pretend at least to
      forgive Annie, and yielding to sudden Celtic impulse, knelt
      at her feet, seized her hand, which she had no power to
      withdraw from him, covered it with eager kisses and placed it
      on his head. Little more would have made him cast himself
      prone before her, lift her foot, and place it on his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his father brought a little of his common sense to the
      rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut, Hector!" he said; "give the lass time to come to her
      senses. Would you woo her like a raving maniac? I don't,
      indeed, wonder, after what you heard her tell me, that you
      should have taken such a sudden fancy to her; but&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," interrupted Hector, "it is no fancy&#8212;least of
      all a sudden one! I fell in love with Annie the very first
      time I saw her waiting at table. It is true I did not
      understand what had befallen me for some time; but I do, and
      I did from the first, and now forever I shall both love and
      worship Annie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hector," said Annie, "it was too bad of you to listen. I
      did not know anyone was there but your father. You were never
      intended to hear; and I did not think you would have done
      such a dishonorable thing. It was not like you, Mr. Hector!"
    </p>
    <p>
      How was I to know you had secrets with my father, Annie?
      Dishonorable or not, the thing is done, and I am glad of
      it&#8212;especially to have heard what you had no intention
      of telling me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not have believed it of you, Mr. Hector!" persisted
      Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, now that I think of it," suggested Mr. Macintosh, "may
      not your mother think she has something to say in the matter
      between you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a thought already dawning upon her that terrified
      Annie; she knew, indeed, perfectly how his mother would
      regard Hector's proposal, and she dared not refer the matter
      to her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be out of the house first, Mr. Hector," she
      said&#8212;and I think she meant&#8212;"before I confess my
      love."
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression Annie had made upon her master may be judged
      from the fact that he rose and went, leaving his son and the
      parlor-maid together.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then passed between them I cannot narrate precisely.
      Overwhelmed by Hector's avowal, and quite unprepared as she
      had been for it, it was yet no unwelcome news to Annie.
      Indeed, the moment he addressed her, she knew in her heart
      that she had been loving him for a long time, though never
      acknowledging to herself the fact. Such must often be the
      case between two whom God has made for each other. And
      although he were a bold man who said that marriages were made
      in heaven, he were a bolder who denied that love at first
      sight was never there decreed. For where God has fitted
      persons for each other, what can they do but fall mutually in
      love? Who will then dare to say he did not decree that
      result? As to what may follow after from their own behavior,
      I would be as far from saying that was <i>not</i> decreed as
      from saying the conduct itself <i>was</i> decreed. Surely
      there shall be room left, even in the counsels of God, for as
      much liberty as belongs to our being made in his
      image&#8212;free like him to choose the good and refuse the
      evil! He who <i>has</i> chosen the good remains in the law of
      liberty, free to choose right again. He who always chooses
      the right, will at length be free to choose like God himself,
      for then shall his will itself be free. Freedom to choose and
      freedom of the will are two different conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the lovers, which it wanted no moment to make them,
      left the room, they had agreed that Annie must at once leave
      the house. Hector took her to her mother's door, and when he
      returned he found that his father and mother had retired. But
      it may be well that I should tell a little more of what had
      passed between the lovers before they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie's first thought when they were left together was,
      "Alas! what will my mistress say? She must think the worst
      possible of me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Hector!" she broke out, "whatever will your mother think
      of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No good, I'm afraid," answered Hector honestly. "But that is
      hardly what we have to think of at this precise moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take back what you said!" cried Annie; "I will promise you
      never to think of it again&#8212;at least, I will <i>try</i>
      never once to do so. It must have been all my
      fault&#8212;though I do not know how, and never dreamed it
      was coming. Perhaps I shall find out, when I think over it,
      where I was to blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt you are capable of inventing a hundred
      reasons&#8212;after hearing your awful guilty confession to
      my father, you little innocent!" answered Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the ice thus broken, things went on a good deal better,
      and they came to talk freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Hector, "I am not so silly or so wicked as
      to try to persuade you that my mother will open her arms to
      you. She knows neither you nor herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will she be terribly angry?" said Annie, with a foreboding
      quaver in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather, I am afraid," allowed Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then don't you think we had better give it up at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never forever!" cried Hector. "That is not what I fell in
      love with you for! I will not give you up even for Death
      himself! He is not the ruler of our world. No lover is worthy
      of the name who does not defy Death and all his works!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not afraid of him, Hector. I, too, am ready to defy
      him. But is it right to defy your mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, when she wants one to be false and dishonorable. For
      herself, I will try to honor her as much as she leaves
      possible to me. But my mother is not my parents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please, Hector, don't quibble. You would make me doubt
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we won't argue about it. Let us wait to hear what
      <i>your</i> mother will say to it to-morrow, when I come to
      see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really will come? How pleased my mother will be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what else should I do? I thought you were just talking
      of the honor we owe to our parents! Your mother is mine too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of yours then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I dare say I shall have a talk with <i>my</i> mother
      first, but what <i>your</i> mother will think is of far more
      consequence to me. I know only too well what my mother will
      say; but you must not take that too much to heart. She has
      always had some girl or other in her mind for me; but if a
      man has any rights, surely the strongest of all is the right
      to choose for himself the girl to marry&#8212;if she will let
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps his mother would choose better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you do not know, Annie, that I am five-and-twenty
      years of age: if I have no right yet to judge for myself,
      pray when do you suppose I shall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not the right I'm thinking of, but the experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I see! You want me to fall in love with a score of women
      first, so that I may have a chance of choosing. Really,
      Annie, I had not thought you would count that a great
      advantage. For my part, I have never once been in love but
      with you, and I confess to a fancy that that might almost
      prove a recommendation to you. But I suppose you will at
      least allow it desirable that a man should love the girl he
      marries? If my preference for you be a mere boyish fancy, as
      probably my mother is at this moment trying to persuade my
      father, at what age do you suppose it will please God to give
      me the heart of a man? My mother is sure to prefer somebody
      not fit to stand in your dingiest cotton frock. Anybody but
      you for my wife is a thing unthinkable. God would never
      degrade me to any choice of my mother's! He knows you for the
      very best woman I shall ever have the chance of marrying.
      Shall I tell you the sort of woman my mother would like me to
      marry? Oh, I know the sort! First, she must be tall and
      handsome, with red, fashionable hair, and cool, offhand
      manners. She must never look shy or put out, or as if she did
      not know what to say. On the contrary, she must know who's
      who, and what's what, and never wear a dowdy bonnet, but
      always a stunning hat. And she must have a father who can
      give her something handsome when she is married. That's my
      mother's girl for me. I can't bear to look such a girl in the
      face! She makes me ashamed of myself and of her. The sort I
      want is one that grows prettier and prettier the more you
      love and trust her, and always looks best when she is busiest
      doing something for somebody. Yes, she has black hair, black
      as the night; and you see the whiteness of her face in the
      darkest night. And her eyes, they are blue, oh, as blue as
      bits of the very sky at midnight! and they shine and flash
      so&#8212;just like yours, and nobody else's, my darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      But here they heard footsteps on the stair&#8212;those of
      Mrs. Macintosh, hurrying up to surprise them. They guessed
      that her husband had just left her, and that she was in a
      wild fury; simultaneously they rose and fled. Hector would
      have led the way quietly out by the front door; but Annie
      turning the other way to pass through the kitchen, Hector at
      once turned and followed her. But he had hardly got up with
      her before she was safe in her mother's house, and the door
      shut behind them. There Hector bade her goodnight, and,
      hastening home, found all the lights out, and heard his
      father and mother talking in their own room; but what they
      said he never knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Annie had hardly done dressing when she
      heard a knock at the street-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That'll be Hector, mother," she said. "I'm thinking he'll be
      come to have a word with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Annie!" exclaimed her mother, in rebuke of the liberty she
      took. "But if you mean young Mr. Macintosh, what on earth can
      he want with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bide a minute, mother," answered Annie, "and he'll tell you
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Melville went to the door and opened it to the young
      man, who stood there shy and expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Melville," he said, "I have come to tell you that I
      love your Annie, and want to make her <i>my</i> Annie as
      well. I am more sorry than I can tell you to confess that I
      am not able to marry at once, but please wait a little while
      for me. I shall do my best to take you both home with me as
      soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked for a moment silently in his face, then, throwing
      her arms round his neck, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I wonder who wouldn't be glad to wait for your sweet
      face to the very Day of Judgment, sir, when all must have
      their own at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewith she burst into tears, and, turning, led the way to
      the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's your Hector, Annie," she said as she opened the door.
      "Take him, and make much of him, for I'm sure he deserves
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she drew him hastily into the room, and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," Hector went on, "I must let you both know that my
      mother is dead against my having Annie. She thinks, of
      course, that I might do better; but I know she is only far
      too good for me, and that I shall be a fortunate as well as
      happy man the day we come together. She has already proved
      herself as true a woman as ever God made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is that, sir, as I know and can testify, who have known
      her longer than anybody else. But sit you down and love each
      other, and never mind me; I'll not be a burden to you as long
      as I can lift a hand to earn my own bread. And when I'm old
      and past work, I'll not be too proud to take whatever you can
      spare me, and eat it with thankfulness."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sat down, and were soon making merry together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing could reconcile Mrs. Macintosh to the thought of
      Annie for her daughter-in-law; her pride, indignation, and
      disappointment were much too great, and they showed
      themselves the worse that her husband would not say a word
      against either Annie or Hector, who, he insisted, had behaved
      very well. He would not go a step beyond confessing that the
      thing was not altogether as he could have wished, but upheld
      that it contained ground for satisfaction. In vain he called
      to his wife's mind the fact that neither she nor he were by
      birth or early position so immeasurably above Annie. Nothing
      was of any use to calm her; nothing would persuade her that
      Annie had not sought their service with the express purpose
      of carrying away her son. Her behavior proved, indeed, that
      Annie had done prudently in going at once home to her mother,
      where presently her late mistress sought and found her;
      acting royally the part of one righteously outraged in her
      dearest dignity. Her worst enemy could have desired for her
      nothing more degrading than to see and hear her. She insisted
      that Hector should abjure Annie, or leave the house. Hector
      laid the matter before his father. He encouraged him to humor
      his mother as much as he could, and linger on, not going
      every night to see the girl, in the hope that time might work
      some change. But the time passed in bitter reproaches on the
      part of the mother, and expostulations on the part of the
      son, and there appeared no sign of the amelioration the
      father had hoped for. The fact was that Mrs. Macintosh's
      natural vulgarity had been so pampered by what she regarded
      as wealth, and she had grown so puffed up, that her very
      person seemed to hold the door wide for the devil. For
      self-importance is perhaps a yet deeper root of all evil than
      even the love of money. Any deep, honest affection might have
      made it too hot for the devil, but in her heart there was
      little room for such a love. She seemed to believe in nothing
      but mode and fashion, to care for nothing but what she called
      "the thing." She grew in self-bulk, and gathered more and
      more weight in her own esteem: she wore yet showier and more
      vulgar clothes, and actually cultivated a slang that soon
      bade farewell to delicacy, so that she sank and she sank, and
      she ate and she drank, until at last she impressed her
      good-natured clergyman himself as one but a very little above
      the beasts that perish&#8212;if, indeed, she was in any
      respect equal to a good, conscientious dog! She retained,
      however, this much respect for her son, for which that son
      gave her little thanks, that by-and-by she limited herself to
      ex-pending all her contempt upon Annie, and toward Hector
      settled into a dogged silence, where upon he, finding it
      impossible to make any progress toward an understanding where
      he could not even get a reply, at last gave up the attempt
      and became as silent as she.
    </p>
    <p>
      To poor Annie it was a terrible thought that she should thus
      have come between mother and son; but she remembered that she
      had read of mothers who without cause had even hated their
      own flesh, and how much the more might not she who knew her
      ambitions and designs so utterly opposed to the desires of
      her son?
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon all at once awoke in Annie the motherhood that
      lies deepest of all in the heart of every good woman, making
      her know in herself that, his mother having forsaken him, she
      had no choice but take him up and be to him henceforward both
      wife and mother. What remains of my story will perhaps serve
      to show how far she succeeded in fulfilling this her vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mr. Macintosh saw that things could not thus
      continue, and that he had better accept an offer made him
      some time before by a London correspondent&#8212;to take
      Hector into his banking-house and give him the opportunity of
      widening his experience and knowledge of business; and
      Hector, on his part, was eager to accept the proposal. The
      salary offered for his services was certainly not a very
      liberal one, but the chief attraction was that the hours were
      even shorter than they had been with his father, and would
      yet enlarge his liberty of an evening. Hector's delights, as
      we have seen, had always lain in literature, and in that
      direction the labor in him naturally sought an outlet. Now
      there seemed a promise of his being able to pursue it yet
      more devotedly than before: who could tell but he might ere
      long produce something that people might care to read? Some
      publisher might even care to put it in print, and people
      might care to buy it! That would start him in a more genuine
      way of living, and he might the sooner be able to marry
      Annie&#8212;an aspiration surely legitimate and not too
      ambitious. He had had a good education, and considered
      himself to be ably equipped. It was true he had not been to
      either Oxford or Cambridge, but he had enjoyed the advantages
      possessed by a Scotch university even over an English one,
      consisting mainly in the freedom of an unhampered
      development. Since then he had read largely, and had
      cultivated naturally wide sympathies. As his vehicle for
      utterance, we have already seen that he had a great
      attraction to verse, and had long held and argued that the
      best training for effective prose was exercise in the fetters
      of verse&#8212;a conviction in which he had lived long enough
      to confirm himself, and perhaps one or two besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      His relations with his mother, and consequent impediments to
      seeing Annie, took away the sting of having to part with her
      for awhile; and, when he finally closed with the offer, she
      at once resumed her application for a place in the High
      School, and was soon accepted, for there were not a few in
      the town capable of doing justice to her fitness for the
      office; so that now she had the joy not merely of being able
      to live with her mother as before, and of contributing to her
      income, but of knowing at the same time that she lived in a
      like atmosphere with Hector, where her growth in the
      knowledge of literature, and her experience in the world of
      thought, would be gradually fitting her for a companion to
      him whom she continued to regard as so much above her. Her
      marked receptivity in the matter of verse, and her intrinsic
      discrimination of nature and character in it, became in her,
      at length, as they grew, sustaining forces, enlarging her
      powers both of sympathy and judgment, so that soon she came
      to feel, in reading certain of the best writers, as if she
      and Hector were looking over the same book together, reading
      and pondering it as one, simultaneously seeing what the
      writer meant and felt and would have them see and feel. So
      that, by the new intervention of space, they were in no sense
      or degree separated, but rather brought by it actually, that
      is, spiritually, nearer to each other. Also Hector wrote to
      her regularly on a certain day of every week, and very rarely
      disappointed her of her expected letter, in which he uttered
      his thoughts and feelings more freely than he had ever been
      able to do in conversation. This also was a gain to her, for
      thus she went on to know him better and better, rising
      rapidly nearer to his level of intellectual development,
      while already she was more than his equal in the moral
      development which lies at the root of all capacity for
      intellectual growth. So Annie grew, as surely&#8212;without
      irreverence I may say&#8212;in favor both with God and man;
      for at the same time she grew constantly in that loveliest of
      all things&#8212;humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Hector left without similar consolation in his life,
      although passed apart from Annie. For, not to mention the
      growing pleasure that he derived from poring over Annie's
      childlike letters&#8212;and here I would beg my reader to
      note the essential distinction betwixt childish and
      childlike&#8212;full of the keenest perceptions and the
      happiest phrases, he had soon come to make the acquaintance
      of a kindred spirit, a man whom, indeed, it took a long time
      really to know, but who, being from the first attracted to
      him, was soon running down the inclined plane of
      acquaintanceship with rapidly increasing velocity toward
      something far better than mere acquaintance: nor was there
      any check in their steady approach to a thorough knowledge of
      each other. He was a slightly older man, with a greater
      experience of men, and a good deal wider range of interests,
      as could hardly fail to be the case with a Londoner. But the
      surprising thing to both of them was that they had so many
      feelings in common, giving rise to many judgments and
      preferences also in common; so that Hector had now a
      companion in whom to find the sympathy necessary to the
      ripening of his taste in such a delicate pursuit as that of
      verse; and their proclivities being alike, they ran together
      like two drops on a pane of glass; whence it came that at
      length, in the confident expectation of understanding and
      sympathy, Hector found himself submitting to his friend's
      judgment the poem he had produced when first grown aware that
      he was in love with Annie Melville; although such was his
      sensitiveness in the matter of his own productions that
      hitherto he had not yet ventured on the experiment with Annie
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His new friend read, was delighted; read again, and spoke out
      his pleasure; and then first Hector knew the power of
      sympathy to double the consciousness of one's own faculty. He
      took up again the work he had looked upon as finished, and
      went over it afresh with wider eyes, keener judgment, and
      clearer purpose; when the result was that, through the
      criticisms passed upon it by his friend, and the reflection
      of the poem afresh in his own questioning mind, he found many
      things that had to be reconsidered; after which he committed
      the manuscript, carefully and very legibly re-written, once
      more to his friend, who, having read it yet again, was more
      thoroughly pleased with it than before, and proposed to
      Hector to show it to another friend to whom the ear of a
      certain publisher lay open. The favorable judgment of this
      second friend was patiently listened to by the publisher, and
      his promise given that the manuscript should receive all
      proper attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this part of my story there is no occasion to linger; for,
      strange thing to tell,&#8212;strange, I mean, from the
      unlikelihood of its happening,&#8212;the poem found the
      sympathetic spot in the heart of the publisher, who had
      happily not delegated the task to his reader, but read it
      himself; and he made Hector the liberal offer to undertake
      all the necessary expenses, giving him a fair share of
      resulting profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stranger yet, the poem was so far a success that the whole
      edition, not a large one, was sold, with a result in money
      necessarily small but far from unsatisfactory to Hector. At
      the publisher's suggestion, this first volume was soon
      followed by another; and thus was Hector fairly launched on
      the uncertain sea of a literary life; happy in this, that he
      was not entirely dependent on literature for his bodily
      sustenance, but was in a position otherwise to earn at least
      his bread and cheese. For some time longer he continued to
      have no experience of the killing necessity of writing for
      his daily bread, beneath which so many aspiring spirits sink
      prematurely exhausted and withered; this was happily
      postponed, for there are as much Providence and mercy in the
      orderly arrangement of our trials as in their inevitable
      arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reception by what is called the public was by no means so
      remarkable or triumphant as to give his well-wishers any
      ground for anxiety as to its possible moral effect upon him;
      but it was a great joy to him that his father was much
      interested and delighted in the reception of the poem by the
      Reviews in general. He was so much gratified, indeed, that he
      immediately wrote to him stating his intention of
      supplementing his income by half as much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflected opinion of others wrought also to the
      mollifying of his mother's feelings toward him; but those
      with which she regarded Annie they only served to indurate,
      as the more revealing the girl's unworthiness of him. And
      although at first she regarded with favor her husband's kind
      intention toward Hector, she faced entirely round when he
      showed her a letter he had from his son thanking him for his
      generosity, and communicating his intention of begging Annie
      to come to him and be married at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie was living at home, feeding on Hector's letters, and
      strengthened by her mother's sympathy. She was teaching
      regularly at the High School, and adding a little to their
      common income by giving a few music lessons, as well as
      employing her needle in a certain kind of embroidery a good
      deal sought after, in which she excelled. She had heard
      nothing of his having begun to distinguish himself, neither
      had yet seen one of the reviews of his book, for no one had
      taken the trouble to show her any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, as she stood waiting a moment for something
      she wanted in the principal bookshop of the town, a little
      old lady, rather shabbily dressed, came in, whom she heard
      say to the shopman, in a gentle voice, and with the loveliest
      smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you another copy of this new poem by your townsman,
      young Macintosh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry I have not, ma'am," answered the shopman; "but I
      can get you one by return of post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, if you please, and send it me at once. I am very glad to
      hear it promises to be a great success. I am sure it quite
      deserves it. I have already read it through twice. You may
      remember you got me a copy the other day. I cannot help
      thinking it an altogether remarkable production, especially
      for so young a man. He is quite young, I believe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am&#8212;to have already published a book. But as to
      any wonderful success, there is so little sale for poetry
      nowadays. I believe the one you had yourself, my lady, is the
      only one we have been asked for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much will depend," said the lady, "on whether it finds a
      channel of its own soon enough. But get me another copy,
      anyhow&#8212;and as soon as you can, please. I want to send
      it to my daughter. There is matter between those Quaker-like
      boards that I have found nowhere else. I want my daughter to
      have it, and I cannot part with my own copy," concluded the
      old lady, and with the words she walked out of the shop,
      leaving Annie bewildered, and with the strange feeling of a
      surprise, which yet she had been expecting. For what else but
      such success could come to Hector? Had it not been drawing
      nearer and nearer all the time? And for a moment she seemed
      again to stand, a much younger child than now, amid the gusty
      whirling of the dead leaves about her feet, once more on the
      point of stooping to pick up what might prove a withered
      leaf, but was in reality a pound-note, the thing which had
      wrought her so much misery, and was now filling her cup of
      joy to the very brim. The book the old lady had talked of
      could be no other than Hector's book. No other than Hector
      could have written it. What a treasure there was in the world
      that she had never seen! How big was it? what was it like?
      She was sure to know it the moment her eyes fell upon it. But
      why had he never told her about it? He might have wanted to
      surprise her, but she was not the least surprised. She had
      known it all the time! He had never talked about what he was
      writing, and still less would he talk of what he was going to
      write. Intentions were not worthy of his beautiful mouth!
      Perhaps he did not want her to read it yet. When he did, he
      would send her a copy. And, oh! when would her mother be able
      to read it? Was it a very dear book? There could be no
      thought of their buying it! Between them, she and her mother
      could not have shillings enough for that. When the right time
      came, he would send it. Then it would be twice as much hers
      as if she had bought it for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she met Mr. and Mrs. Macintosh, and the former
      actually congratulated her on what Hector had done and what
      people thought of him for it; but the latter only gave a
      sniff. And the next post brought the book itself, and with it
      a petition from Hector that she would fix the day to join him
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie made haste, therefore, to get ready the dress of white
      linen in which she meant to be married, and a lady, the
      sister of Hector's friend, meeting her in London, they were
      married the next day, and went together to Hector's humble
      lodgings in a northern suburb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector's new volume, larger somewhat, but made up of smaller
      poems, did not attract the same amount of attention as the
      former, and the result gave no encouragement to the publisher
      to make a third venture. One reason possibly was that the
      subjects of most of the poems, even the gayest of them, were
      serious, and another may have been that the common tribe of
      reviewers, searching like other parasites, discovered in them
      material for ridicule&#8212;which to them meant food, and as
      such they made use of it. At the same time he was not left
      without friends: certain of his readers, who saw what he
      meant and cared to understand it, continued his readers; and
      his influence on such was slowly growing, while those that
      admired, feeling the power of his work, held by him the more
      when the scoffers at him grew insolent. Still, few copies
      were sold, and Hector found it well that he had other work
      and was not altogether dependent on his pen, which would have
      been simple starvation. And, from the first, Annie was most
      careful in her expenditure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the simple people whom husband brought her to know, she
      speedily became a great favorite, and this circle widened
      more rapidly after she joined it. For her simple truth, which
      even to Hector had occasionally seemed some what overdriven,
      now revealed itself as the ground of her growing popularity.
      She welcomed all, was faithful to all, and sympathetic with
      all. Nor was it longer before her husband began to study her
      in order to understand her&#8212;and that the more that he
      could find in her neither plan nor system, nothing but
      straightforward, foldless simplicity. Nor did she ever come
      to believe less in the foreseeing care of God. She ceased
      perhaps to attribute so much to the ministry of the angels as
      when she took the fiercer blast that rescued from the flames
      the greasy note and blew it uncharred up the roaring chimney
      for the sudden waft of an angel's wing; but she came to meet
      them oftener in daily life, clothed in human form, though
      still they were rare indeed, and often, like the angel that
      revealed himself to Manoah, disappeared upon recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by it seemed certain that, if ever Hector had had
      anything of what the world counts success, it had now come to
      a pause. For a long time he wrote nothing that, had it been
      published, could have produced any impression like that of
      his first book; it seemed as if the first had forestalled the
      success of those that should follow. That had been of a new
      sort, and the so-called Public, innocent little
      personification, was not yet grown ready for anything more of
      a similar kind, which, indeed, seemed to lack elements of
      attraction and interest; and the readers to whom the same man
      will tell even new things are apt to grow weary of his mode
      of saying, even though that mode have improved in directness
      and force; the tide of his small repute had already begun to
      take the other direction. Those who understood and prized his
      work, still holding by him, and declaring that they found in
      him what they found in no other writer, remained stanch in
      their friendship, and among them the little old lady who had
      at once welcomed his first poem to her heart and whose name
      and position were now well known to Hector. But the
      reviewers, seeming to have forgotten their first favorable
      reception of him, now began to find nothing but faults in his
      work, pointing out only what they judged ill contrived and
      worse executed in his conceptions, and that in a tone to
      convey the impression that he had somehow wheedled certain of
      them into their former friendly utterances concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And about the same time it so happened that business began to
      fall away rapidly from the bank of which his father held the
      chief country agency, so that he was no longer able to
      continue to Hector his former subsidy, the announcement of
      which discouraging fact was accompanied by a lecture on the
      desirableness of a change in his choice of subject as well as
      in his style; if he continued to write as he had been doing
      of late, no one would be left, his father said, to read what
      he wrote!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it began to be evident what a happy thing it was for
      Hector that Annie was now at his side to help him. For, as
      his courage sank, and he saw Annie began to feel straitened
      in her housekeeping, he saw also how her courage arose and
      shone. But he grew more and more discouraged, until it was
      all that Annie could do to hold him back from despair. At
      length, however, she began to feel that possibly there might
      be some truth in what his father had written to him, and a
      new departure ought to be attempted. She could not herself
      believe that her husband was limited to any style or subject
      for the embodiment of his thoughts; he who had written so
      well in one fashion might write at least well, if not as
      well, in another! Had she not heard him say that verse was
      the best practice for writing prose?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently, therefore, and cautiously she approached the matter
      with him, only to find at first, as she had expected, that he
      but recoiled from the suggestion with increase of
      discouragement. Still, taking no delight in obstinacy, and
      feeling the necessity of some fresh attempt grow daily more
      pressing, he turned his brains about, and sending them
      foraging, at length bethought him of a certain old Highland
      legend with which at one time he had been a good deal taken,
      from the discovery in it of certain symbolical possibilities.
      This legend he proceeded to rewrite and remodel, doing his
      best endeavor to preserve in it the old Celtic aroma and
      aerial suggestion, while taking care neither to lose nor
      reproduce too manifestly its half-apparent, still evanishing
      symbolism. Urged by fear and enfeebled by doubt, he wrote
      feverously, and, after three days of laborious and unnatural
      toil, submitted the result to Annie, who was now his only
      representative of the outer world, and the only person for
      whose criticism he seemed now to care. She, greatly in doubt
      of her own judgment, submitted it to his friend; and together
      they agreed on this verdict: That, while it certainly proved
      he could write as well in prose as in verse, people would not
      be attracted by it, and that it would be found lacking in
      human interest. His friend saw in it also too much of the
      Celtic tendency to the mystical and allegorical, as
      distinguished from the factual and storial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon learning this their decision, poor Hector fell once more
      into a state of great discouragement, not feeling in him the
      least power of adopting another way; there seemed to him but
      one mode, the way things came to him. And in this surely he
      was right&#8212;only might not things come, or be sent to him
      in some other way? His friend suggested that he might,
      changing the outward occurrences, and the description of the
      persons to whom they happened, in such fashion that there
      could be no identification of them, tell the very tale of how
      Annie and he came to know and love each other, taking
      especial care to muffle up to shapelessness, or at least
      featurelessness, the part his mother had taken in their
      story. This seeming to Hector a thing possible, he took
      courage, and set about it at once, gathering interest as he
      proceeded, and writing faster and faster as he grew in hope
      of success. At the same time it was not favorable to the
      result that he felt constantly behind him, the darkly
      lowering necessity that, urging him on, yet debilitated every
      motion of the generating spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took him a long time to get the story into a condition
      that he dared to consider even passable; and the longer that
      he had not the delight that verse would have brought with it
      in the process of its production. Nevertheless he would now
      and then come to a passage in writing which the old emotion
      would seem to revive; but in reading these, Annie, modest and
      doubtful as she always was of her own judgment, especially
      where her husband's work was concerned, seemed to recognize a
      certain element of excitement that gave it a glow, or rather,
      glamour of unreality, or rather, unnaturalness, which
      affected her as inharmonious, therefore unfit, or out of
      place. She thought it better, however, to say little or
      nothing of any such paragraph, and tried to regard it as of
      small significance, and probably carrying little influence in
      respect of the final judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative, such as it might prove, was at length
      finished, and had been read, at least with pleasure and hope,
      by his friend, who was still the only critic on whose
      judgment he dared depend, for he could not help regarding
      Annie as prejudiced in his favor, although her approval
      continued for him absolutely essential. The sole portions to
      which his friend took any exception were the same concerning
      which Annie had already doubted, and which he found too
      poetical in their tone&#8212;not, he took care to say, in
      their meaning, for that could not be too poetical, but in
      their expression, which must impinge too sharply upon prosaic
      ears that cared only for the narrative, and would recoil from
      any reflection, however just in itself, that might be woven
      into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas, now came what Hector felt the last and final blow
      to the possibility of farther endeavor in the way of
      literature!
    </p>
    <p>
      The bank to which Hector had been introduced by his father,
      and in which he had been employed ever since, had of late
      found it necessary to look more closely to its outlay and
      reduce its expenses; therefore, believing that Hector had
      abundance of other resources, its managers decided on giving
      him notice first of all that they must in future deprive
      themselves of the pleasure of his services. And this
      announcement came at a time when Annie was already in no
      small difficulty to make the ends of her expenditure meet
      those of her income. In fact, she had no longer any income.
      For a considerable time she had, by the stinting of what had
      before that seemed necessities, been making a shilling do the
      work of eighteenpence, and now she knew nothing beyond,
      except to go without. But how allow Hector to go without? He
      must die if she did! Already he had begun to shrink in his
      clothes from lack of proper nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rumor reaching him of a certain post as librarian, in the
      gift of an old corporation, being vacant, Hector at once made
      application for it, but only to receive the answer that
      Pegasus must not be put in harness: poor Pegasus, on a false
      pretense of respect, must be kept out of the shafts! His fat
      friends would not permit him to degrade himself earning his
      bread by work he could have done very well; he must rather
      starve! He tried for many posts, one after the other. Heavier
      and heavier fell upon him each following disappointment.
      Annie had in her heart been greatly disappointed that no
      prospect appeared of a child to sanctify their union; but for
      that she had learned more than to console herself with the
      reflection that at least there was no such heavenly visitor
      for whose earthly sojourn to provide; and now how gladly
      would she have labored for the child in the hope that such a
      joy and companionship might lift him up out of his
      despondency! Then he would be able to enjoy and assimilate
      the poor food she was able to get for him. It is true he
      always seemed quite content; but, then, he would often, she
      believed, pretend not to be hungry, and certainly ate less
      and less. Hitherto she had fought with all her might against
      running in debt to the tradespeople, for, more than all else,
      she feared debt. Now, at last, however, her resolution was in
      danger of giving way, when, happily, Hector bethought himself
      of his precious books; to what better use could he put them
      than sell them to buy food&#8212;wherein the books he had
      written had failed him? Parcel by parcel in a leather strap,
      he carried them to the nearest secondhand bookseller, where
      he had so often bought; now he wanted to sell, but,
      unhappily, he soon found that books, like many other things,
      are worth much less to the seller than to the buyer, and
      where Hector had calculated on pounds, only shillings were
      forthcoming. Yet by their sale, notwithstanding, they managed
      to keep a little longer out of debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in these days Annie had at length finished her fair copy
      of Hector's last book, writing it out in her own lovelily
      legible hand&#8212;not such as ladies in general count
      legible, because they can easily read it themselves; she
      could do better than that, she could write so that others
      could not fail to read. For Hector had always believed that
      the acceptance of his first volume had been owing not a
      little to the fact that he had written it out most legibly,
      and he held that what reveals itself at once and without
      possibility of mistake may justly hope for a better reception
      than what from the first moment annoys the reader with a
      sense of ill-treatment. It is no wonder, he said, if such a
      manuscript be at once tossed aside with an imprecation.
      Legibility is the first and intelligibility the only other
      thing rendered due by the submission of a manuscript to any
      publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector spent a day or two in remodeling and modifying the
      passages remarked upon by his wife and his friend, and then,
      with hope reviving in both their hearts, the manuscript was
      sent in, acknowledged, and the day appointed when an answer
      would be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a certain dark morning, therefore, in November, having
      nothing else whatever to do, Hector set out in his much-worn
      Inverness cape to call upon his former publisher in the City,
      with whom of late he had had no communication. The weather
      was cold and damp, threatening rain. But Hector was too much
      of a Scotchman to care about weather, and too full of anxiety
      to mind either cold or wet. He had, indeed, almost always
      felt gloomy weather exciting rather than depressing. For one
      thing, it seemed, when he was indoors, to close him about
      with protection from uncongenial interruption, leaving the
      freer his inventive faculty; and now that he was abroad in
      it, and no inventive faculty left awake, it seemed to clothe
      him with congenial sympathy, for the weather was just the
      same inside him. And now, as he strode along with his eyes on
      the ground, he scarcely saw any of the objects about him, but
      sought only the heart of the City, where he hoped to find the
      publisher in his office, ready to print his manuscript, and
      advance him a small sum in anticipation of possible profit.
      So absorbed was he in thought undefined, and so sunk in
      anxiety as to the answer he was about to receive, that more
      than once he was nearly run over by the cart of some reckless
      tradesman&#8212;seeming to him, in its over-taking
      suddenness, the type of prophetic fate already at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, he arrived safe in the outer shop, where
      the books of the firm were exposed to sight, in process of
      being subscribed for by the trade. There a pert young man
      asked him to take a seat, while he carried his name to the
      publisher, and there for some time he waited, reading titles
      he found himself unable to lay hold of; and there, while he
      waited, the threatened rain began, and, ere he was admitted
      to the inner premises, such a black deluge came pouring down
      as, for blackness at least, comes down nowhere save in
      London. With this accompaniment, he was ushered at length
      into a dingy office, deep in the recesses of the house, where
      a young man whom he saw for the first time had evidently,
      while Hector waited in the shop, been glancing at the
      manuscript he had left. Little as he could have read,
      however, it had been enough, aided perhaps by the weather, to
      bring him to an unfavorable decision; his rejection was
      precise and definite, leaving no room for Hector to say
      anything, for he did not seem ever to have heard of him
      before. Hector rose at once, gathered up his papers from the
      table where they lay scattered, said "Good-morning," and went
      out into the sooty rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing whitherward to point his foot, he stopped at the
      corner of King William Street, close to the money-shops of
      the old Lombards, and there stood still, in vain endeavor to
      realize the blow that had stunned him. There he stood and
      stood, with bowed head, like an outcast beggar, watching the
      rain that dropped black from the rim of his saturated hat.
      Becoming suddenly conscious, however, that the few wayfarers
      glanced somewhat curiously at him as they passed, he started
      to walk on, not knowing whither, but trying to look as if he
      had a purpose somewhere inside him, whereas he had still a
      question to settle&#8212;whether to buy a bun, and, on the
      strength of that, walk home, or spend his few remaining pence
      on an omnibus, as far as it would take him for the money, and
      walk the rest of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, as if out of the depths of despair, arose in
      him an assurance of help on the way to him, and with it a
      strength to look in the face the worst that could befall him;
      he might at least starve in patience. Therewith he drew
      himself up, crossed the street to the corner of the Mansion
      House, and got into an omnibus waiting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he could creep into his grave and have done! Why
      should that hostelry of refuge stand always shut? Surely he
      was but walking in his own funeral! Were not the mourners
      already going about the street before ever the silver cord
      was loosed or the golden bowl broken? Might he not now at
      length feel at liberty to end the life he had ceased to
      value? But there was Annie! He would go home to her; she
      would comfort him&#8212;yes, she would die with him! There
      was no other escape; there was no sign of coming deliverance.
      All was black within and around them. That was the rain on
      the gravestones. He was in a hearse, on his way to the
      churchyard. There the mourners were already gathered. They
      were before him, waiting his arrival. No! He would go home to
      Annie! He would not be a coward soldier! He would not kill
      himself to escape the enemy! He would stand up to the Evil
      One, and take his blows without flinching. He and his Annie
      would take them together, and fight to the last. Then, if
      they must die, it was well, and would be better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas! what if the obligation of a live soul went farther
      than this life? What if a man was bound, by the fact that he
      lived, to live on, and do everything possible to keep the
      life alive in him? There his heart sank, and the depths of
      the sea covered it! Did God require of him that, sooner than
      die, he should beg the food to keep him alive? Would he be
      guilty of forsaking his post, if he but refused to ask, and
      waited for Death? Was he bound to beg? If he was, he must
      begin at once by refusing to accept the smallest credit! To
      all they must tell the truth of their circumstances, and
      refuse aught but charity. But was there not something yet he
      could try before begging? He had had a good education, had
      both knowledge and the power of imparting it; this was still
      worth money in the world's market. And doubtless therein his
      friend could do something for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewithal his new dread was gone; one possibility was yet
      left him in store! To his wife he must go, and talk the thing
      over with her. He had still, he believed, threepence in his
      pocket to pay for the omnibus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began to move; and then first, waking up, he saw that he
      had seated himself between a poor woman and a little girl,
      evidently her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry to incommode you, ma'am," he said
      apologetically to the white-faced woman, whose little tartan
      shawl scarcely covered her shoulders, painfully conscious of
      his dripping condition, as he took off his hat, and laid it
      on the floor between his equally soaking feet. But, instead
      of moving away from him to a drier position beyond, the
      woman, with a feeble smile, moved closer up to him, saying to
      her daughter on his other side:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit closer to the gentleman, Jessie, and help to keep him
      warm. She's quite clean, sir," she added. "We have plenty of
      water in our place, and I gave her a bath myself this
      morning, because we were going to the hospital to see my
      husband. He had a bad accident yesterday, but thank God! not
      so bad as it might have been. I'm afraid you're feeling very
      cold, sir," she added, for Hector had just given an
      involuntary shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband he's a bricklayer," she went on; "he has been in
      good work, and I have a few shillings in hand, thank God!
      Times are sure to mend, for they seldom turns out so bad as
      they looks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily Hector's hand moved to his trouser pocket, but
      dropped by his side as he remembered the fare. She saw his
      movement, and broke into a sad little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mistake me, sir," she resumed. "I told you true when I
      said I wasn't without money; and, before the pinch comes,
      wages, I dare say, will show their color again. Besides, our
      week's rent is paid. And he's in good quarters, poor fellow,
      though with a bad pain to keep him company, I'm afraid"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you live?" asked Hector "But," he went on, "why
      should I ask? I am as poor as you&#8212;poorer, perhaps, for
      I have no trade to fall back upon. But I have a good wife
      like you, and I don't doubt she'll think of something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust to that, sir! A good woman like I'm sure she is 'll be
      sure to think of many a thing before she'll give in. My
      husband, he was brought up to religion, and he always says
      there's one as know's and don't forget." But now the omnibus
      had reached the spot where Hector must leave it. He got up,
      fumbling for his threepenny-piece, but failed to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't forget your hat, sir; it'll come all right when it's
      dry," said the woman, as she handed it to him. But he stood,
      the conductor waiting, and seemed unable to take it from her:
      he could not find the little coin!
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, sir!" interposed the woman, as she made haste
      and handed him three coppers; "I have plenty for both of us,
      and wish for your sake it was a hundred times as much. Take
      it, sir," she insisted, while Hector yet hesitated and
      fumbled; "you won't refuse such a small service from another
      of God's creatures! I mean it well."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the conductor, apparently affected with the same
      generosity, pushed back the woman's hand, saying, "No, no,
      ma'am, thank you! The gentleman 'll pay me another day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector pulled out an old silver watch, and offered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot be so sure about that," he said. "Better take this:
      it's of little use to me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be damned if I do!" cried the conductor fiercely, and
      down he jumped and stood ready to help Hector from the
      omnibus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his kindness was more than Hector could stand; he walked
      away, unable to thank him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder now," muttered the conductor to himself when Hector
      was gone, "if that was a put-up job between him and the
      woman? I don't think so. Anyhow, it's no great loss to
      anybody. I won't put it down; the company 'll have to cover
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector turned down a street that led westward, drying his
      eyes, and winking hard to make them swallow the tears which
      sought to hide from him a spectacle that was calling aloud to
      be seen. For lo! the street-end was filled with the glory of
      a magnificent rainbow. All across its opening stretched and
      stood the wide arch of a wonderful rainbow. Hector could not
      see the sun; he saw only what it was making; and the old
      story came back to him, how the men of ancient time took the
      heavenly bow for a promise that there should no more be such
      a flood as again to destroy the world. And therefore even now
      the poets called the rainbow the bow of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor, even in these days of question and unbelief, is it
      matter of wonder that, at sight of the harmony of blended and
      mingling, yet always individual, and never confused colors,
      and notwithstanding his knowledge of optics, and of how the
      supreme unity of the light was secerned into its decreed
      chord, the imaginative faith of the troubled poet should so
      work in him as to lift his head for a moment above the waters
      of that other flood that threatened to overwhelm his
      microcosm, and the bow should seem to him a new promise,
      given to him then and individually, of the faithfulness of an
      unseen Power of whom he had been assured, by one whom he
      dared not doubt, that He numbered the very hairs of his head.
      Once more his spirit rose upon the wave of a hope which he
      could neither logically justify nor dare to refuse; for hope
      is hope whencesoever it spring, and needs no justification of
      its self-existence or of its sudden marvelous birth. The very
      hope was in itself enough for itself. And now he was near his
      home; his Annie was waiting for him; and in another instant
      his misery would be shared and comforted by her! He was
      walking toward the wonder-sign in the heavens. But even as he
      walked with it full in view, he saw it gradually fade and
      dissolve into the sky, until not a thread of its loveliness
      remained to show where it had spanned the infinite with its
      promise of good. And yet, was not the sky itself a better
      thing, and the promise of a yet greater good? He must walk
      onward yet, in tireless hope! And the resolve itself
      endured&#8212;or fading, revived, and came again, and ever
      yet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ere he had passed the few yards that lay between him and
      Annie yet another wonder befell: as if the rainbow had
      condensed, and taken shape as it melted away, there on the
      pathway, in the thickening twilight of the swift-descending
      November night, stood a creature, surely not of the night,
      but rather of the early morn, a lovely little
      child&#8212;whether wandered from the open door of some
      neighboring house, or left by the vanished rainbow, how was
      he to tell? Endeavoring afterward to recall every point of
      her appearance, he could remember nothing of her feet, or
      even of the frock she wore. Only her face remained to him,
      with its cerulean eyes&#8212;the eyes of Annie, looking up
      from under the cloud of her dark hair, which also was
      Annie's. She looked then as she stood, in his memory of her,
      as if she were saying, "I trust in you; will you not trust in
      Him who made the rainbow?" For a moment he seemed to stand
      regarding her, but even while he looked he must have
      forgotten that she was there before him, for when again he
      knew that he saw her, though he did not seem ever to have
      looked away from her, she had changed in the gathering
      darkness to the phantasm of a daisy, which still gazed up in
      his face trustingly, and, indeed, went with him to his own
      door, seeming all the time to say, "It was no child; it was
      me you saw, and nothing but me; only I saw the sun&#8212;I
      mean, the man that was making the rainbow." And never more
      could he in his mind separate the child, whom I cannot but
      think he had verily seen, from the daisy which certainly he
      had not seen, except in the atmosphere of his troubled and
      confused soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may help my reader to understand its confusion if I recall
      to him the fact that Hector had that day eaten nothing. Nor
      must my wife reader think hardly of Annie for having let him
      leave the house without any food, for he had stolen softly
      away, and closed the door as softly behind him, thinking how
      merrily they would eat together when he came back with his
      good news. And now he was bringing nothing to her but the
      story of a poor woman and her child who had warmed him, and
      of an omnibus-conductor who had trusted him for his fare, and
      of a rainbow and a child and a daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you naughty, naughty dear!" cried Annie, as she threw
      herself into his arms, rejoicing. But at sight of his worn
      and pallid face the smile faded from hers, and she thought,
      "What can have befallen him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lip quivered, and, seeking with a watery smile to
      reassure her, he gave way and burst into tears. Unmanly of
      him, no doubt, but what is a man to do when he cannot help
      it? And where is a man to weep if not on his wife's bosom?
      Call this behavior un-English, if you will; for, indeed,
      Hector was in many ways other than English, and, I protest,
      English ways are not all human. But I will not allow that it
      manifested any weakness, or necessarily involved shame to
      him; the best of men, and the strongest&#8212;yea, the one
      Man whose soul harbored not an atom of self-pity&#8212;upon
      one occasion wept, I think because he could not persuade the
      women whom he loved and would fain console to take comfort in
      his Father. Annie, for one reverent moment, turned her head
      aside, then threw her arms about him, and hid her glowing
      face in his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's only me in the house, dear," she said, and led the
      way to their room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached it, she closed the door, and turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they won't take your story?" she said, assuming the fact,
      with a sad, sunny smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They refused it absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, never mind! I shall go out charing to-morrow. You have
      no notion how strong I am. It is well for you I have never
      wanted to beat you. Seriously, I believe I am much stronger
      than you have the least notion of. There! Feel that
      arm&#8212;I should let you feel it another way, only I am
      afraid of hurting you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had turned up the sleeve of her dress, and uncovered a
      grandly developed arm, white as milk, and blossoming in a
      large, splendidly formed hand. Then playfully, but oh! so
      tenderly, with the under and softest part of her arm she
      fondled his face, rubbing it over first one, then the other
      cheek, and ended with both arms round his neck, her hands
      folding his head to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wife! wife!" faltered Hector, with difficulty controlling
      himself; "my strong, beautiful wife! To think of your
      marrying me for this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hector," answered Annie, drawing herself back with dignity,
      "do you dare to pity me? That would be to insult me! As if I
      was not fit to be your wife when doing <i>everything</i> for
      my mother! There are thousands of Scotch girls that would
      only be proud to take my place, poor as you are&#8212;and you
      couldn't be much poorer&#8212;and serve you, without being
      your wife, as I have the honor and pride to be! But, my
      blessed man, I do believe you have eaten nothing to-day; and
      here am I fancying myself your wife, and letting you stand
      there empty, instead of bestirring myself to get you some
      supper! What a shame! Why, you are actually dying with
      hunger!" she cried, searching his face with pitiful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, I am not in the least hungry," protested
      Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must be hungry at once, sir. I will go and bring
      you something the very sight of which will make you hungry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have no money, Annie; and, not being able to pay, we
      must go without. Come, we will go to bed." "Yes, I am ready;
      I had a good breakfast. But you have had nothing all day. And
      for money, do you know Miss Hamper, the dressmaker, actually
      offered to lend me a shilling, and I took it. Here it is. You
      see, I was so sure you would bring money home that I thought
      we <i>might</i> run that much farther into debt. So I got you
      two fresh eggs and such a lovely little white loaf. Besides,
      I have just thought of something else we could get a little
      money for&#8212;that dainty chemise my mother made for me
      with her own hands when we were going to be married. I will
      take it to the pawnbroker to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was never in a pawnshop, Annie. I don't think I should
      know how to set about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You!</i>" cried Annie, with a touch of scorn. "Do you
      think I would trust a man with it? No; that's a woman's work.
      Why, you would let the fellow offer you half it was
      worth&#8212;and you would take it too. I shall show it to
      Mrs. Whitmore: <i>she</i> will know what I ought to get for
      it. She's had to do the thing herself&#8212;too often, poor
      thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be like tearing my heart out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! to part with my pretty chemise. Hector, dear, you must
      not be foolish! What does it matter, so long as we are not
      cheating anybody? The pawnshop is a most honorable and useful
      institution. No one is the worse for it, and many a one the
      better. Even the tradespeople will be a trifle the better. I
      shall be quite proud to know that I have a pawn-ticket in my
      pocket to fall back upon. Oh, there's that old silk dress
      your mother sent me&#8212;I do believe that would bring more.
      It is in good condition, and looks quite respectable. If Eve
      had got into a scrape like ours, she would have been
      helpless, poor thing, not having anything <i>to put
      away</i>&#8212;that is the right word, I believe. There is
      really nothing disgraceful about it. Come now, dear, and eat
      your eggs&#8212;I'm afraid you must do without butter. I
      always preferred a piece of dry bread with an egg&#8212;you
      get the true taste of the egg so much better. One day or
      another we must part with everything. It is sure to come.
      Sooner or later, what does that matter? 'The readiness is
      all,' as Hamlet says. Death, or the pawnshop, signifies
      nothing. 'Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is
      it to leave betimes?' We do but forestall the grave for one
      brief hour with the pawnshop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You deserve to have married Epictetus, Annie, you brave
      woman, instead of Xantippe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prefer you, Hector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what might you have said if he had asked you, and you
      had heard me bemoaning the pawnshop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then, indeed! But, in the meantime, we will go to bed
      and wait there for to-morrow. Is it not a lovely thing to
      know that God is thinking about you? He will bring us to
      <i>our desired haven,</i> Hector, dearest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So in their sadness they laid them down. Annie opened her
      arms and took Hector to her bosom. There he sighed himself to
      sleep; and God put His arms about them both, and kept them
      asleep until the morning.
    </p>
    <pre>
  And in this love, more than in bed, I rest.
</pre>
    <p>
      Annie was the first to spring up and begin to dress herself,
      pondering in her mind as she did so whether to go first to
      the pawnbroker's or to the baker, to ask him to recommend her
      as a charwoman. She would tell him just the truth&#8212;that
      she must in future work for her daily bread. Then Hector rose
      and dressed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Annie!" he said, as he did so, "is it gone, that awful
      misery of last night in the omnibus? It seemed, as I jolted
      along, as if God had forgotten one of the creatures he had
      made, and that one was me; or, worse, that he thought of me,
      and would not move to help me! And why do I feel now as if He
      had help for me somewhere near waiting for me? I think I will
      go and see a man who lives somewhere close by, and find out
      if he is the same I used to know at St. Andrews; if he be the
      same, he may know of something I could try for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," replied Annie. "I will go with you, and on the way call
      at the grocer's&#8212;I think he will be the best to ask if
      he knows of any family that wants a charwoman or could give
      me any sort of work. There's more than one kind of thing I
      could turn my hand to&#8212;needle-work, for instance. I
      could make a child's frock as well, I believe, as a
      second-rate dressmaker. Can you tell me who was the first
      tailor, Hector? It was God himself. He made coats of skins
      for Adam and his wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, dear. You may well try your hand&#8212;as I
      know you have done many a time already. And, if I can get
      hold of ever so young a pupil, I shall be glad even to teach
      him his letters. We must try anything and everything. We are
      long past being fastidious, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and went on with his toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Hector," said Annie suddenly, and walked to the
      mantelpiece, "I am so sorry! Here is a letter that came for
      you yesterday. I did not care to open it, though you have
      often told me to open any letters I pleased. The fact is, I
      forgot all about it; I believe, because I was so unhappy at
      your going away without breakfast. Or perhaps it was that I
      was frightened at its black border. I really can't tell now
      why I did not open it."
    </p>
    <p>
      With little interest and less hope, Hector took the
      letter,&#8212;black-bordered and black-sealed,&#8212;opened
      it, and glanced carelessly at the signature, while Annie
      stood looking at him, in the hope merely that he would find
      in it no fresh trouble&#8212;some forgotten bill perhaps!
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw his face change, and his eyes grow fixed. A moment
      more and the letter dropped in the fender. He stood an
      instant, then fell on his knees, and threw up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, darling?" she cried, beginning to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only five hundred pounds!" he answered, and burst into an
      hysterical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" cried Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who <i>can</i> have played us such a cruel trick?" said
      Hector feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no trick, Hector!" exclaimed Annie. "There's nobody
      would have the heart to do it. Let <i>me</i> see the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She almost caught it from his hands as he picked it from the
      fender, and looked at the signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hale &amp; Hale?" she read. "I never heard of them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nor anyone else, I dare say," answered Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us see the address at the top," said Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is&#8212;Philpot Lane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is that? I don't believe there is such a place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, there is; I've seen it&#8212;somewhere in the City,
      I believe. But let us read the letter. I saw only the
      figures. I confess I was foolish enough at first to fancy
      somebody had sent us five hundred pounds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not?" cried Annie. "I am sure there's no one more in
      want of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just why not," answered Hector. "Did you ever know a
      rich man leave his money to a poor relation? Oh, I hope it
      does not mean that my father is gone. He may have left us a
      trifle. Only he could not have had so much to leave to
      anybody. I know he loved you, Annie."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Annie had been doing the one sensible
      thing&#8212;reading the letter, and now she stood pondering
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it, Hector. He always uses good people to do his
      kindnesses. Don't you remember me telling you about the
      little old lady in Graham's shop the time your book came
      out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Annie; I wasn't likely to forget that; it was my love
      for you that made me able to write the poem. Ah, but how soon
      was the twenty pounds I got for it spent, though I thought it
      riches then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it was&#8212;and so it is!" cried Annie, half laughing,
      but crying outright. "It's just that same little old lady.
      She was so delighted with the book, and with you for writing
      it, that she put you down at once in her will for five
      hundred pounds, believing it would help people to trust in
      God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here was I distrusting so much that I was nearly ready
      to kill myself. Only I thought it would be such a terrible
      shock to you, my precious! It would have been to tell God to
      his face that I knew he would not help me. I am sure now that
      he is never forgetting, though he seems to have forgotten.
      There was that letter lying in the dark through all the hours
      of the long night, while we slept in the weariness of sorrow
      and fear, not knowing what the light was bringing us. God is
      good!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go and see these people and make sure," said Annie.
      "'Hale and Hearty,' do they call themselves? But I'm going
      with you myself this time! I'm not going to have such another
      day as I had yesterday&#8212;waiting for you till the sun was
      down, and all was dark, you bad man!&#8212;and fancying all
      manner of terrible things! I wonder&#8212;I wonder,
      if&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do you wonder, Annie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only whether, if now we were to find out it was indeed all a
      mistake, I should yet be able to hope on through all the
      rest. I doubt it; I doubt it! Oh, Hector, you have taught me
      everything!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More, it seems, than I have myself learned. Your mother had
      already taught you far more than ever I had to give you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is much too early yet, I fear, to call in the City,"
      said Annie. "Don't you think we should have time first to
      find out whether the gentleman we were thinking of inquiring
      after to-day be your old college friend or not? And I will
      call at the grocer's, and tell him we hope to settle his bill
      in a few days. Then you can come to me, and I will go to you,
      and we shall meet somewhere between."
    </p>
    <p>
      They did as Annie propose; and before they met, Hector had
      found his friend, and been heartily received both by him and
      by his young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length they reached Philpot Lane, and were seated in
      an outer room waiting for admission, Annie said: "Surely, if
      rich people knew how some they do not know need their help,
      they would be a little more eager to feather their wings ere
      they fly aloft by making friends with the Mammon of
      unrighteousness. Don't you think it may be sometimes that
      they are afraid of doing harm with their money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid it is more that they never think what our Lord
      meant when he said the words. But oh, Annie! is it a bad sign
      of me that the very possibility of this money could make me
      so happy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were admitted at length, and kindly received by a
      gray-haired old man, who warned them not to fancy so much
      money would last them very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir," answered Annie, "the best thing we expect from
      it is that it will put my husband in good heart to begin
      another book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! your husband writes books, does he? Then I begin to
      understand my late client's will. It is just like her," said
      the old gentleman. "Had you known her long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never once saw her," said Hector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I did," said Annie, "and I heard her say how delighted
      she was with his first book. Please, sir," she added, "will
      it be long before you can let us have the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it by-and-by," answered the lawyer; "all in
      good time."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now first they learned that not a penny of the money
      would they receive before the end of a twelvemonth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that will give us plenty of time to die first,"
      thought Hector, "which I am sure the kind lady did not intend
      when she left us the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing they learned was that, even then, they would
      not receive the whole of the money left them, for seeing they
      could claim no relation to the legator, ten per cent must be
      deducted from their legacy. If they came to him in a year
      from the date of her death, he told them he would have much
      pleasure in handing them the sum of four hundred and fifty
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they left the office&#8212;not very exultant, for they
      were both rather hungry, and had to go at once in search of
      work&#8212;with but a poor chance of borrowing upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Hector broke the silence by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare, Annie, I feel so light and free already that I
      could invent anything, even a fairy tale, and I feel as if it
      would be a lovely one. I hope you have a penny left to buy a
      new bottle of ink. The ink at home is so thick it takes three
      strokes to one mark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear, I have a penny; I have two, indeed&#8212;just
      twopence left. We shall buy a bottle of ink with one,
      and&#8212;shall it be a bun with the other? I think one penny
      bun will divide better than two halfpenny ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Only, mind, <i>I'm</i> to divide it. But, do you
      know, I've been thinking," said Hector, "whether we might not
      take a holiday on the strength of our expectations, for we
      shall have so long to wait for the money that I think we may
      truly say we have <i>great</i> expectations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we should do better," answered Annie, "to go back to
      your old friend, Mr. Gillespie, and tell him of our
      good-fortune, and see whether he can suggest anything for us
      to do in the meantime."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector agreed, and together they sought the terrace where Mr.
      and Mrs. Gillespie lived, who were much interested in their
      story; and then first they learned that the lady was at least
      well enough off to be able to help them, and, when they left,
      she would have Annie take with her a dozen of her
      handkerchiefs, to embroider with her initials and crest; but
      Annie begged to be allowed to take only one, that Mrs.
      Gillespie might first see how she liked her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For, then, you see," she said to her husband, as they went
      home, "I shall be able to take it back to her this very
      evening and ask her for the half-crown she offered me for
      doing it, which I should not have had the face to do with
      eleven more of them still in my possession. I have no doubt
      of her being satisfied with my work; and in a week I shall
      have finished the half of them, and we shall be getting on
      swimmingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the winter Hector wrote steadily every night, and
      every night Annie sat by his side and
      embroidered&#8212;though her embroidery was not <i>all</i>
      for other people. Many a time in after years did their
      thoughts go back to that period as the type of the happy life
      they were having together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time Hector went to see Mr. Gillespie, that
      gentleman suggested that he should give a course of lectures
      to ladies upon English Poetry, beginning with the Anglo-Saxon
      poets, of whom Gillespie said he knew nothing, but would be
      glad to learn a great deal. He knew also, he said, some
      ladies in the neighborhood willing to pay a guinea each for a
      course of, say, half-a-dozen such lectures. They would not
      cost Hector much time to prepare, and would at once bring in
      a little money. Coleridge himself, he suggested, had done
      that kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Hector, "but he was Coleridge. I have nothing to
      say worth saying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave your hearers to judge of that," returned Gillespie.
      "Do your best, and take your chance. I promise you two pupils
      at least not over-critical&#8212;my wife and myself. It is
      amazing how little those even who imagine they love it know
      about English poetry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where should I find a room?" Hector still objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would not this drawing room do?" asked his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendidly!" answered Hector. "But what will Mrs. Gillespie
      say to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She and I are generally of one mind&#8212;about people, at
      least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will go home at once and set about finding what to
      say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I will go out at once and begin hunting you up an
      audience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gillespie succeeded even better than he had anticipated; and
      there was at the first lecture a very fair gathering indeed.
      When it was over, the one that knew most of the subject was
      the young lecturer's wife. The first course was followed by
      two more, the third at the request of almost all his hearers.
      And the result; was that, before the legacy fell due, Annie
      had paid all their debts and had not contracted a single new
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the happy day dawned Annie was not able to go with
      her husband to receive the money; neither did Hector wish
      that she had been able, for he was glad to go alone. By her
      side lay a lovely woman-child peacefully asleep. Hector
      declared her the very image of the child the rainbow left
      behind as it vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when the mother was a little stronger, she called
      Hector to her bedside, and playfully claimed the right to be
      the child's godmother, and to give it her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who else can have so good a right?" answered Hector. Yet
      he wondered just a little that Annie should want the child
      named after herself, and not after her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the time for the child's baptism came, Annie, who
      would hold the little one herself, whispered in the ear of
      the clergyman:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The child's name is Iris."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have told my little story. But perhaps my readers will have
      patience with me while I add just one little inch to the tail
      of the mouse my mountain has borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hector's next book, although never so popular as in any
      outward sense to be called a success, yet was not quite a
      failure even in regard to the money it brought him, and even
      at the present day has not ceased to bring in something.
      Doubtless it has faults not a few, but, happily, the man who
      knows them best is he who wrote it, and he has never had to
      repent that he did write it. And now he has an audience on
      which he can depend to welcome whatever he writes. That he
      has enemies as well goes without saying, but they are rather
      scorners than revilers, and they have not yet caused him to
      retaliate once by criticising any work of theirs. Neither, I
      believe, has he ever failed to recognize what of genuine and
      good work most of them have produced. One of the best results
      to himself of his constant endeavor to avoid jealousy is that
      he is still able to write verse, and continues to take more
      pleasure in it than in telling his tales. And still his own
      test of the success of any of his books is the degree to
      which he enjoyed it himself while writing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His legacy has long been spent, and he has often been in
      straits since; but he has always gathered good from those
      straits, and has never again felt as if slow walls were
      closing in upon him to crush him. And he has hopes by God's
      help, and with Annie's, of getting through at last, without
      ever having dishonored his high calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time I saw him, he introduced his wife to
      me&#8212;having just been telling me his and her
      story&#8212;with the rather enigmatical words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my wife. You cannot see her very well, for, like
      Hamlet, I wear her 'in my heart's core, aye, in my heart of
      hearts!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Far Above Rubies, by George MacDonald

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FAR ABOVE RUBIES ***

This file should be named 7fbrb10h.htm or 7fbrb10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 7fbrb11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 7fbrb10ah.htm

David Garcia, Jonathan Ingram, and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made

ways.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is

          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at

     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
