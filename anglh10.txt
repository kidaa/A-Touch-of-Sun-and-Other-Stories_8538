THE ANGEL OF LONESOME HILL
A STORY OF A PRESIDENT

by Frederick Landis
Author of "The Glory of His Country"

1910

[Illustration: Those who passed by night were grateful for the lamp]


It was a handful of people in the country--a simple-hearted handful.
There was no railroad--only a stage which creaked through
the gullies and was late. Once it had a hot-box, and the place drifted
through space, a vagrant atom.

Time swung on a lazy hinge. Children came; young folks married;
old ones died; Indian Creek overflowed the bottom-land; crops failed;
one by one the stage bore boys and girls away to seek their fortunes in
the far-off world; at long intervals some tragedy streaked the yellow
clay monotony with red; January blew petals from her silver garden;
April poured her vase of life; August crawled her snail length; years
passed, leaving rusty streaks back to a dull horizon.

The sky seemed higher than anywhere else; clouds hurried over this
place called "Cold Friday."

A mile to the east was "Lonesome Hill." Indians once built signal
fires upon it, and in this later time travellers alighted as their horses
struggled up the steep approach. At the top was a cabin; it was
whitewashed, and so were the apple-trees round it. A gourd vine clung
to its chimney; pigeons fluttered upon its shingles, and June flung a
crimson rose mantle over its side and half-way up the roof.

One wished to stop and rest beneath its weeping willow by the
white stone milk house.

Those who passed by day were accustomed to a woman's face at the
window--a calm face which looked on life as evening looks on day--such
a face as one might use to decorate a fancy of the old frontier. Those
who passed by night were grateful for the lamp which protested against
Nature's apparent consecration of the place to solitude.

This home held aloof from "Cold Friday"; many times Curiosity went
in, but Conjecture alone came out, for through the years the man and
woman of this cabin merely said, "We came from back yonder." Nobody
knew where "yonder" was.

But the law of compensation was in force--even in "Cold Friday."
With acquaintanceships as with books, the ecstasy of cutting leaves
is not always sustained in the reading, and the silence of this man and
woman was the life of village wonder.

It gave "Friday's" chimney talk a spice it otherwise had never known;
the back log seldom crumbled into ashes till the bones of these cabin
dwellers lay bleaching on the plains of "Perhaps."

John Dale was seventy-five years or more, but worked his niggard hillside
all the day, and seldom came to town. His aged wife was kind; the
flowers of her life she gave away, but none could glance upon the garden.
She seemed to know when neighbors were ill; hers was the dignity of being
indispensable. Many the mother of that region who, standing beneath
some cloud, thanked God as this slender, white-haired soul with star
shine in her face, hurried over the fields with an old volume pasted full
of quaint remedies.

She made a call of another kind--just once--when the "Hitchenses"
brought the first organ to "Cold Friday."

She remained only long enough to go straight to the cabinet, which the
assembled neighbors regarded with distant awe, and play several pieces
"without the book." On her leaving with the same quiet indifference, Mrs.
Ephraim Fivecoats peered owlishly toward Mrs. Rome Lukens and rendered
the following upon her favorite instrument:

"Well! if that woman ever gits the fever an' gits deliriums, I want
to be round, handy like. I'll swan there'll be more interestin' things
told than we've heerd in our born days--that woman is allus thinkin'!"

In this final respect, the judgment of the Lady of the House of Fivecoats
was sound.

How gallant the mind is! If the past be sad, it mingles with Diversion's
multitude till Sadness is lost; if the present be unhappy, it has a
magic thrift of joys, and Unhappiness is hushed by Memory's laughter;
if both past and present have a grief, it seeks amid its scanty store for
some event, for instance, whose recurrence brings some brightness; to
greet this it sends affectionate anticipations--and were its quiver empty,
it would battle still some way!

So the wife of Dale looked forward to Doctor Johnston's visits, yet
there were so many doors between her silence and the world, she did
not turn as he entered one eventful day.

Doctors are Nature's confessors, and down the memory of this one
wandered a camel of sympathy upon which the sick had heaped their secret
woes for years, though one added naught to the burden.

It was the tale he wished to hear, and when some fugitive phrase promised
revelation, he folded the powders slowly; but when it ended in a sigh,
he strapped up bottles and expectations and went away, reflecting how
poor the world where one might hear all things save those which interested.

But Time is a patient locksmith to whom all doors swing open.

"I always sit by this window," she began as he removed the fever
thermometer; "I've looked so long, I see nothing in a way--and at night
I always put the light here. If he should come in the dark I want him
to see--here is a letter."

The Doctor read and returned it with a look of infinite pity.

"I had a dream last night; I may be superstitious or it may be the fever--
but it was so real. I saw it all; it was just like my prayer. I believe in
God, you know." She smiled in half reproach. "Yes, in spite of all.

"In that dream something touched my hand and a voice whispered the
word, 'Now.' Oh, how anxious it was! I awoke, sitting up; the lamp
had gone out, yet it was not empty--and there was no wind."

John Dale stumbled into the room, his arms full of wood, and an old dog,
lying before the fireplace, thumped his tail against the floor with
diminishing vigor.

She arose. "I'll get you a bite to eat, Doctor."

"Never mind! I must be going." He made a sign to Dale, who followed
to the gate.

"John, I've been calling here a long time--"

"I know I ought to pay somethin'," Dale started to say.

"It isn't that--I've just diagnosed the case; only one man can cure it."

"Would he--on credit?" Dale anxiously inquired.

"He never charges." Johnston smiled sorrowfully at the old man's
despair.

"Who is he?"

"The President; the President of the United States," he added as
Dale's eyes filled with questions. "I came out of college a sceptic,
John, and I'd be an infidel outright but for that wife of yours--she's
nearer the sky, somehow, than any other mortal I've seen. I don't
believe in anything, of course--but that dream--if I were you I'd trust
it--I'd follow where it led."

With his foot on the hub, the farmer slowly whetted his knife on
his boot. "I'll go with you, Doctor."

       *       *       *       *       *

"I called at the office, but it was locked, and so I'm here," apologized
Dale as Judge Long opened the door of his old-fashioned stone house in
Point Elizabeth, the county seat.

"Glad to see you--had your supper?"

Hearing voices in the dining-room, he answered in the affirmative.

"Then have a cigar and wait in the library; the folks are having a
little company."

The old man surveyed the room; the books alone were worth more than
his earthly possessions. From a desk loomed a bust of Webster. Shadows
seemed to leap from it; the sombre lips bespoke the futility of striving
against stern realities.

There was gayety in the dining-room; Judge Long was a fountain of
mirth, a favorite at taverns, while riding the circuit--before
juries--wherever people gathered.

A gale of laughter greeted his last anecdote and the diners protested as
he arose.

Dale told his story excitedly, and at the conclusion Judge Long slowly
brushed away the tobacco smoke.

"I'm sorry, John, but we did all we could last month--and we failed;
there's just one thing to do--face the matter. It's hard, but this world is
chiefly water, and what isn't water is largely rock--it's for fish and
fossils, I suppose."

"But we will win now!" The old man's hand fell with decision.

"Why do you say that?"

"Mother had another dream last night."

"But, you know, she had one a month ago," quietly protested Long.

"Yes--and it came true--we didn't do our part just right. We can't
fail this time; there must be a day of justice!"

"Well, as to that, John, this game of life is strange; we bring nothing
with us, so how can we lose? We take nothing away, so how can we
win? We think; we plan; we stack these plans with precision, but Chance
always sits at our right, waiting to cut the cards. You speak of 'justice.'
It's a myth. The statue above the court-house stands first on one foot,
then on the other, tired of waiting, tired of the sharp rocks of
technicality, tired of the pompous farce. Why, Dale," he waved a hand
toward an opposite corner, "if old Daniel Webster were here he couldn't
do anything!"

When an American lawyer cites that mighty shade it is conclusive, but
the effect was lost on Dale. He was not a lawyer, neither had he read the
"Dartmouth College Case" nor the "Reply to Hayne." In fact his relations
with the "Sage of Marshfield" were so formal he believed his fame
to rest chiefly on having left behind a multitude of busts. Besides, he was
impatient; the Judge's peroration having lifted his head so suddenly
that cigar ashes fell upon the deep rug at his feet.

"You won't go again, Judge?" He leaned forward perplexed.

"It's no use."

"Well, mebbe you can't do anything--mebbe Dan'l Webster couldn't--but
John Dale can!"

Long arose, astonished. "How foolish! Reason for a moment--any
presentation of this matter calls for the highest ability; it involves
sifting of evidence; symmetry of arrangement; cohesiveness of method, logic
of argument, persuasiveness of advocacy, subtleties of acumen, charms
of eloquence--all the elements of the greatest profession among men!"

Dale leaned heavily against the table, his eyes following the Judge as he
walked back and forth.

"Well, I've got 'em--I can't call 'em by name, but I've got the whole
damned list--and I'm goin'!"

Long stood at bay, his hand on the door, his face glowing with animation.

"Dale, you're old enough to be my father, but you shall listen. You'd
fail before a justice of the peace, and before the President of the United
States--it's absurd. You'd go down there, get mad, probably be arrested
and kill any hope we might have; why, you're guilty of contempt of
court right now. I had a strong influence, yet I failed."

The old farmer of "Lonesome Hill" would listen no more.

"Then wait, John. This letter may at least save you from jail--and you
haven't any money; will this do?"

"It's more than I need, Judge."

"No, keep it all--and keep your temper too."

As the Judge stood in the doorway, watching the venerable figure disappear
in the drizzling night, a young woman from the dining-room stole
to his side and heard him muse: "After all, who knows? A Briton
clad in skins once humbled a Roman emperor."

"Is he in trouble?" she asked.

"Yes, great trouble, and it isn't his fault. Fate's a poor shot. She never
strikes one who is guilty without wounding two who are innocent."

       *       *       *       *       *

Dale was an admirable volunteer and strangely resourceful; he had
something more than courage.

The train did not leave for two hours. He sat in the station till the
clatter of the telegraph drove him out, when he walked toward the
yards with their colored lights, and through his brain raced Speculation's
myriad fiends, all brandishing lanterns like those before him. When,
at last, the train did start, it seemed to roll slowly, though it could
suffer delay and reach the Capital by daybreak.

He read the letter of introduction several times, and wondered what
kind of man the President was; he thought of what he would say--and
how it would end.

At intervals a ghost would extend a long, bony hand and wring drops
of blood from his heart; at such times the President was hostile--the trip
very foolish--he regretted his anger at Judge Long's house; and once,
had the engine been a horse, he might have turned back. At other times
gleams of victory came from somewhere and yet from nowhere, and
routed the gypsies from his brain, and the President stood before him,
a sympathetic gentleman. Once he knew it, and through excess of spirits
walked up and down the aisle, studying the sleeping passengers; for John
Dale travelled in a common "day coach."

At last he yielded to fatigue, and far off on the horizon of consciousness
dimly flashed the duel of his hopes and fears. Rest was impossible, and
after a long time the dawn drifted between his half-closed lids; a glorious
dome floated out of the sky and the porter shouted, "All out for
Washington!"

The cabmen who besieged the well-dressed passengers paid scant homage
to the old man, who walked uncertainly out of the smoky shed and stood
for a moment in Pennsylvania Avenue--on one hand the Capitol, on
the other the Treasury and White House. A great clock above him
struck the hour of six; he hesitated, then went toward the scene of
conflict.

The waking traffic, the great buildings, the pulse of this strange life
filled him with depression. He came to a beautiful park and gazed upon
Lafayette and Rochambeau, then the equestrian statue of Jackson. As he
sat facing the snow-white building with columned portico, the magnolia
blossoms were as incense. Then he could wait no longer and crossed to
the President's office. A policeman stopped him at the steps. He explained
that he had a letter from Judge Long. What! Did this policeman
not know Judge Long?

He sat under a tree, and the policeman walked a few paces away to turn
anon and survey the waiting pilgrim. When the doors opened he entered.
The President would not come for another hour; he would be busy--possibly
he might see him by noon--provided he had credentials.

With a sigh he sank into a chair and was soon asleep.

"Come--this is no cheap lodging house!" The greeting was shaken
into him by a clerk with hair parted in the middle, who disdainfully
surveyed the sleeper's attire.

He who has much on his mind little cares what he has on his back, and
when the youth exploded, "Who are you?" the old fellow's self-reliance
came forth.

Leading the way to the door Dale pointed a trembling finger. "See
that buildin', 'Bub'--and that one yonder, and that patch over there
with Andy Jackson in it? Well, I'm one of the folks that made it all--and
paid for it; and you're one of my hired hands. I've got to keep
so many of you down here I can't afford one on the farm. I want to
see the President--give him this letter--it's from Judge Sylvester Long,
of Point Elizabeth!"

The youth vanished and Dale resumed his chair.

He was looking across the lawn when a sudden alertness came into
the scene; the silk-hatted line of callers stepped aside; those who were
seated arose; newspaper correspondents turned with vigilant ears. A
nervous voice inquired, "Where is Mr. John Dale?"

The President stood before him, dressed in white flannel, then smilingly
grasped his hand with a blast of welcome: "I'm delighted to meet
the friend of Judge Long!" Taking his arm the Executive escorted him
through the Cabinet Room thronged with Senators, Representatives, and
tourists. They entered the private office. "Take the sofa, Mr. Dale--it's
the easiest thing in the place. I hope your business is such that you
can excuse me for a little while."

A smile came over Dale's white face. Could the poorest farmer of
the "Cold Friday" region wait for the most powerful character in the
world? Nor was the old man in the linen duster the only one who smiled.
A member of the Russian Embassy turned to his companion--a distinguished
visitor from the Court of St. Petersburg: "What would a peasant
say to the Czar?"

The President now entered the Cabinet Room, shaking hands with
the many, guiding a few into his private office. Dale listened; now it was
an introduction and a message to an old friend in the West. Then a decisive
"No" dashed some hope of patronage; again, it was a discussion
of poetry, aerial navigation, or the relics of the Aztecs. It was a long
stride from "Lonesome Hill," and for the time Dale was novelty's captive.
He glanced round the room. It was not as fine as the director's
office of the Point Elizabeth Bank! Above the mantel--the place of
honor--was the painting of a martyr. He wondered whether another stroke
of the brush would have brought a smile to the face, or an expression of
sadness. The hands were very large--they  had once broken iron bands.

In one corner was a shot-gun; tennis rackets in another; on a chair
were snow-shoes and on the desk a sheaf of roses.

Those whom the President had sifted into his office from the crowd
outside engaged in conversation. A Senator discussed the ball game with
a Supreme Court Justice; a General advised an Author to try deep breathing.

The President returned more animated than before. He placed a
hand on Dale's shoulder: "Be comfortable--and stay for lunch; nobody
but us."

The crowd paid sudden respect to the homespun citizen of an older day,
and a great happiness came into his heart--it was like the unfolding of one
of the roses. Not that he was to lunch with the President, though Dale's
was the village estimate of human greatness. A vaster issue was before
him, and this was a token of success--a success which would bind up his
remaining years with peace, and give glorious recompense to the companion
of his few joys and many griefs.

The President hurriedly signed his name to parchments.

"I'm making a few postmasters." He smiled toward the sofa. "It's no
trouble here--that's all at the other end of the line."

Without stopping the pen, he discussed matters with one statesman
after another, his lips snapping with metallic positiveness.

A member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations protested
against the course pursued in Santo Domingo.

"If I were making a world, Senator, I'd try to get along without putting
in any Santo Domingos, but as things stand, we must make her be
decent or let somebody else do it."

Another brings up the question of taxing incomes and inheritances.

"I favor them both," declared the President. "They are taxes on good
luck; bad luck is its own tax."

A statesman from the Pacific slope protests against Federal interference
in the school question.

"It is a local matter as you say, Senator, and yours is a 'Sovereign
State'--they all are till they get into trouble. If we should have war with
Japan, your State would speedily become an integral part of the Union."

A group of gentlemen now object to an aspirant for a Federal judgeship
on the ground that he has not a "judicial temperament."

"As I understand it," the President begins, "judicial temperament is
largely a fragrance rising from the recollection of corporate employment;
it is the ability to throw a comma under the wheels of progress and upset
public welfare; I am glad to learn that Mr. L---- has _not_ a 'judicial
temperament'; I shall send his name to the Senate to-day."

The gentlemen retired. "Come, Mr. Dale, let us go."

This President had been accused of a lack of dignity. Is it a less valuable
trait which puts the John Dales of our land at instant ease in the
"State Dining-Room" of the White House?

"Well, sir, no man ever had a better friend than Judge Long," said
the President when they were seated. "'Ves' Long, I mean," he added
with a smile.

"I met him in the West; he had a ranch; mine was near it. We saw
much of each other; we hunted together--and that's where you learn
a man's mettle. He never complained of dogs, luck, or weather.
We saw rough times; it was glorious. We'd wake up with snow on the bed,
and when 'Ves' introduced me at Point Elizabeth in my first campaign
he said we often found rabbit tracks on the quilts--but then 'Ves' had a
remarkable eye.

"Some say, 'blood is thicker than water.' That depends somewhat on
the quality of the water; I like him; there's nothing I wouldn't do
for him!"

Dale grew suddenly sick at heart. If Long had only come! Recalling
his discouraging words, a shadow crept over the old man's mind.
Could it be possible he had not tried the month before?

Such misgivings soon vanished. "This is a trying office, Mr. Dale.
With all my feelings I had to hold in abeyance the only favor he ever
asked; it was about a pardon in a murder case over thirty-five years
ago. He said it was the most cruel case of circumstantial evidence in
the books--possibly you may know about the case."

The old man struggled back in his chair, then arose, his rough hand
brushing thin locks back from a temple where the veins seemed swelling
to the danger point. He was unable to summon more than a whisper
from his shrunken throat.

"Yes, Mr. President, I do--he's my boy!"

"Your--boy! Yes--that's the name--how stupid of me--I beg
your pardon, Mr. Dale--a thousand times."

They stared a long while at each other and Dale felt the fears which
had fled before his gracious reception returning to grip him by the heart;
the speech he had prepared had fled; it had all happened so differently.

At last the President spoke: "Congress is just going out; it's the busy
season, but I'll go through the papers to-night myself."

Dale walked to the window; perspiration was on his face, but he was
very cold. He stood with locked brain, and into his eyes came filmy
clouds; then through these he saw, with sudden strangeness, a cabin far
away, and a woman with pallid cheeks looked straight at him.

The President gazed intently as the old man wiped the window pane,
nodded his head, and turned to face the table.

He cleared his throat, then opened a flannel collar, already loose, and
his eyes glistened.

"You're sick!" exclaimed the President rising. "Waiter--some
brandy!"

"No--just a little dizzy.

"Mr. President," he slowly began, "this is a case that all the papers in
the world can't tell--nor all the men--there's none just like it.

"It's not for the boy--it's not for me. I took her from her folks against
their will, and I've not panned out lucky--but that's not to the point.
She's sick; the doctor can't help her--nobody can but you--I wish you
might have seen her from the window yonder."

The half-finished luncheon was disregarded; the President had sunk
into his chair, and the keen discrimination of a king of affairs was
struggling with a strange fascination.

"Long ago, Mr. President, I had an enemy--Bill Hartsell--we shot
each other." He held up a withered hand. "It's been a feud ever since.
His boy and mine went to war in the same company--both as brave as ever
wore the blue. When they were waitin' to be mustered out Bill's boy was
murdered in his tent--in his sleep. Bill was there and swore he saw my
Richard do it.

"One night, a month ago, my woman--she's a great woman, Mr.
President--the sick folks down in my country call her 'The Angel of
Lonesome Hill'--well, she had a dream that Bill Hartsell wanted to see
me. I hadn't laid eyes on him for years. I strapped on my six-shooter
and she said, 'No--it isn't that kind of a trip--it's peace.'

"I put down the shootin' iron and went--it was a long way--two
days on horseback. I got to Bill's cabin at night; I went in without
a knock; I wasn't afraid. Bill's folks were round the bed. He
arose and cried out: 'John, I sent for you; it was a damn lie I told--your
boy didn't do it'--and then Bill died."

For the moment the old man's agitation mastered him.

"I remember, Mr. Dale. 'Ves' told me; he brought the statements
of the family--and yours. I've been thinking of it ever since--and a great
deal these last two days. Tell me, why did you happen to come?"

"Mother had a dream that said the time was up."

Dale spoke as calmly as though delivering a message from a neighbor.

Fear was not even a memory now. He stood erect; the stone he had
slowly pushed up many steep years was near the summit--one mighty
effort might hurl it down the past forever.

"Just a word about that boy, Mr. President. At Cold Harbor his regiment
stood in hell all day; he was one of those who pinned his name to his
coat so his body could be identified--after the charge. Well, in that
charge the flag went down, and a man went out to get it--and he fell; then
another--and he fell; and then a thin, pale fellow that the doctors almost
refused sprang forward like a panther--and he fell. They were askin' for a
volunteer when a staff officer called out: 'Good God! He's alive! He's got
it! He's crawlin' back!'

"They had to lift him off the colors; he didn't know anything, . . . and
that was my boy, Mr. President--that was Dick!

"Funny how he enlisted," Dale resumed after a moment. "He'd been
tryin' to get in, but I kept him out. One night his mother sent him for a
dime's worth of clothes-line--and he never came back. He's not bad, Mr.
President; he's good--he gets it from his mother."

Dale lifted his head with pride: "When I was on the jury I heard
Judge Long say no one could be punished if their name wasn't written in
the indictment. Now, they didn't only convict Dick--they convicted
his mother--this whole world's her prison--and it's illegal, Mr.
President--her name wasn't written in that indictment--and it's her pardon
I want."

The President arose and walked the floor. "How could the man who
saved those colors shoot a comrade in his sleep? Mr. Dale, my faith in
human nature tells me that's a lie!"

He stood for an instant at the window, looking over the fountain, the
river, the tall white Washington needle which pierced the sky, then
quickly stepped to the table and lifted a glass:

"Mr. Dale, I propose a toast--'The Angel of Lonesome Hill' . . . her
liberty!"

       *       *       *       *      *

As they returned to the office there was nothing extraordinary in the
President's vigorous step--that was known the world around. There
was something most unusual, however, in the radiant soul--the splendid
ancient youth of the quaint figure by his side.

At the door where the policeman had watched the waiting pilgrim the
President shook the old man's hand.

"Come again, Mr. Dale, and tell 'Ves' Long I'll go hunting with him
this fall and bring along a man he'll like--a man who catches wolves with
his hands."

       *       *       *      *       *

John Dale knew every fence corner in that region, but the night was so
dark he stopped at times to "feel where he was."

The man with him could not aid him; he was a stranger--a strange
stranger who spoke but once--"How far is it?"

Long habit had made him silent; he was in the upper fifties, but long
absence from the sun had pinched his face into the white mask of great
age.

At the village store the stranger entered, returning with a package.

When the road turned there was a light high ahead and a moment later
the two men entered the cabin.

The stranger paused. "Mother, you sent me for a clothes-line--I've
been delayed--but here it is."

Her hand trembled as she raised the lamp from the table.

"My boy--my dream--the President!"

       *       *       *      *      *

When she lifted her face it was glorified.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,

     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
