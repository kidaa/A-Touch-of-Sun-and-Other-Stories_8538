<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr>
<p>The drama of "Laura Secord" was written to rescue from oblivion
the name of a brave woman, and set it in its proper place among the
heroes of Canadian history. During the first few years of her
residence in Canada the author was often astonished to hear it
remarked, no less among educated than uneducated Canadians, that
"Canada has no history;" and yet on every hand stories were current
of the achievements of the pioneers, and the hardships endured and
overcome by the United Empire Loyalists. Remembering that, as soon
as she had conquered the merest rudiments of reading and grammar at
school, she was set to learn English History, and so become
acquainted with the past of her country, it seemed to the writer
that there was something lacking in a course of teaching that could
leave Canadians to think that their country had no historical past.
Determined to seek out for herself the facts of the case, it was
with feelings of the deepest interest that she read such of the
contributions to the newspaper press as came in her way during the
debate with regard to the pensions asked of Government for the
surviving veterans of 1812 in 1873-4. Among these was incidentally
given the story of Mrs. Secord's heroic deed in warning Fitzgibbon.
Yet it could not pass without observation that, while the heroism
of the men of that date was dwelt upon with warm appreciation and
much urgency as to their deserts, Mrs. Secord, as being a woman,
shared in nothing more tangible than an approving record. The
story, to a woman's mind, was full of pathos, and, though barren of
great incidents, was not without a due richness of colouring if
looked at by appreciative eyes. Nor were the results of Laura
Secord's brave deed insignificant. Had the Americans carried Beaver
Dams at that juncture, the whole peninsula was before
them&mdash;all its supplies, all its means of communication with
other parts of the Province. And Canada&mdash;Upper Canada, at
least&mdash;would have been in the hands of the invaders until, by
a struggle too severe to be contemplated calmly, they had been
driven forth. To save from the sword is surely as great a deed as
to save with the sword; and this Laura Secord did, at an expense of
nerve and muscle fully equal to any that are recorded of the
warrior. To set her on such a pedestal of equality; to inspire
other hearts with loyal bravery such as hers; to write her name on
the roll of Canadian heroes, inspired the poem that bears her name.
But the tribute to her memory would not be complete were it to omit
an appeal to Canadians, especially to the inhabitants of this
Province, who, in their prosperity owe to her so much, to do their
part, and write her name in enduring marble upon the spot where she
lies buried.</p>
<p>Nor does it seem asking more than a graceful act from the
Government of the Dominion&mdash;a Dominion which, but for her,
might never have been&mdash;to do its share in acknowledgment. One
of her daughters still lives, and if she attain to her mother's age
has yet nearly a decade before her.</p>
<p>The drama of "Laura Secord" was written in 1876, and the ballad
a year later, but, owing to the inertness of Canadian interest in
Canadian literature at that date, could not be published. It is
hoped that a better time has at length dawned.</p>

<h2>MEMOIR OF MRS. SECORD</h2>
<hr>
<p>It is at all times an amiable and honourable sentiment that
leads us to enquire into the antecedents of those who, by the
greatness of their virtues have added value to the records of human
history. Whether such inquiry increases our estimation of such
value or not, it must always be instructive, and therefore
inspiring. Under this impression I have sought on every hand to
learn all that could be gathered of the history of one of Canada's
purest patriots. As Dr. Ryerson aptly says in his <i>U. E.
Loyalists and their Times</i>, "the period of the U. E. Loyalists
was one of doing, not recording," therefore little beyond tradition
has conserved anything of all that we would now like to know of the
heroism, the bravery, the endurance, the trials of that bold army
of men and women, who, having laid strong hands on the primeval
forest, dug wide and deep the foundations of a nation whose
greatness is yet to come. In such a light the simple records that
follow will be attractive.</p>
<p>Laura Secord came of loyal blood. She was the daughter of Mr.
Thomas Ingersoll, the founder of the town of Ingersoll, and his
wife Sarah, the sister of General John Whiting, of Great
Barrington, Berkshire County, Mass. At the close of the War of
1776, Mr. Ingersoll came to Canada on the invitation of Governor
Simcoe, an old friend of the family, and founded a settlement on
the banks of the Thames in Oxford County. On the change of
government, Mr. Ingersoll and his struggling settlement of eighty
or ninety families found their prospects blighted and their future
imperilled; Mr. Ingersoll therefore saw it necessary to remove to
Little York, and shortly afterward settled in the township of
Etobicoke. There he resided until some time after the War of
1812-14, when he returned with his family to Oxford County. Here he
died, but left behind him worthy successors of his honourable name
in his two sons, Charles and James.</p>
<p>Charles Ingersoll, with that active loyalty and heroic energy
which alike characterized his patriotic sister, Mrs. Secord, held
prominent positions in the gift of the Government and of the
people, and was also a highly respected merchant and trader.</p>
<p>James Ingersoll, though of a more retiring disposition than his
brother, was a prominent figure in Western Canada for many years.
He was a magistrate of high repute, and occupied a foremost
position in the militia, in which he held the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel at the time of his death. This event took place
on the 9th August, 1886, at which date he had been Registrar for
the County of Oxford fifty-two years.</p>
<p>That Mrs. Secord should be brave, ready, prompt in action, and
fervent <a name="pageii"><!-- Begin Page II --></a> in patriotism
is not surprising, seeing that all the events of her childhood and
youth were blended with those of the settlement of Upper Canada by
the U. E. Loyalists, in whose ranks her family held so honourable a
position, and whose character and sentiments were at all times to
be depended upon.</p>
<p>The family of Secord, of which she became so distinguished a
member, was also a notable one. Family documents exist which show
that in the reign of Louis the Tenth of France a certain Marquis
D'Secor was a Marshal of His Majesty's Household. A son of this
Marquis embraced the Protestant religion, as did younger branches
of the family. During the persecution of the Huguenots many of them
suffered at the stake, and the family estates, situated at La
Rochelle, were confiscated. The survivors escaped the massacre of
St. Bartholomew by flight to England along with many other noble
families, among whom were the Comte de Puys, the Baudeaux, and a
Holland family, the Van Cortlandts.</p>
<p>Eventually five brothers emigrated to America where they settled
in New Jersey, purchasing large tracts of land, founding New
Rochelle and engaging in lumbering. On the breaking out of the
Revolutionary War the family divided, the Loyalists changing their
patronym to Secord by placing the prefix "d" at the end of their
name. These brothers after, as King's men, losing, in common with
all the Loyalists, their property and estates, emigrated to New
Brunswick, again engaging in lumbering and milling operations, and;
there certain of their descendants are to be found today. Some of
these, and their sons, again removed to Canada West, where one of
them, commonly called "Deaf John Secord," who married Miss Wartman,
of Kingston, was known all along the coast from St. John to Quebec
for his hospitalities. Among those who settled in the Niagara
district were Stephen Secord, the miller of St. David's, Major
David Secord, after whom the village was named, and James Secord,
the husband of the heroine of 1812. Stephen Secord died before the
War of 1812, leaving a widow and a family of seven sons. Of Major
David Secord, the only record I have been able to procure is to be
found in <i>A History of the Late War between Great Britain and the
United States of America, by David Thompson, late of the Royal
Scots</i>, as quoted for me by the kind courtesy of Miss Louisa
Murray, of Stamford. It is as follows: "The Second Lincoln Militia,
under Major David Secord, distinguished themselves in this action
[the Battle of Chippewa] by feats of genuine bravery and heroism,
stimulated by the example of their gallant leader, which are seldom
surpassed even by the most experienced veterans. Their loss was
proportionate with that of the regular army."</p>
<p>At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Mr. James Secord was living
at Queenston, where he had a lumber mill and stores. He held the
rank of Captain in the Lincoln Militia until close on the American
invasion, but resigned in dudgeon at some action of his superior
officer, and thus it is that in the relation of Mrs. Secord's
heroic deed he is not designated by any rank. At the first call to
arms, however, Mr. Secord at once offered his services, <a name=
"pageiii"><!-- Begin Page III --></a> which were gladly accepted,
and he was present at the Battle of Queenston Heights. Here he was
severely wounded in the leg and shoulder, and lay on the field as
one dead, until rescued by his brave wife. He never fully recovered
from his wounds, and received an acknowledgment of his voluntary
services to the Government in the appointment to the post of
Collector of Customs at the Port of Chippewa, which he held until
his death in 1841.</p>
<p>The married life of Mr. and Mrs. Secord was a most happy one.
Their third daughter, Mrs. Harriet Smith, who still survives, a
cheerful and vivacious lady of eighty-six, says that her father and
mother were most devoted to each other, and lived in the closest
mutual affection.</p>
<p>At the date of the Battle of Queenston Heights, the family
consisted of four daughters and one son: Mary&mdash;with whom the
great Tecumseh is said to have been in love&mdash;who was married
to Dr. Trumbull, Staff-surgeon to the 37th Regiment, and died in
Jamaica; Charlotte, "the belle of Canada," who, died during a visit
to Ireland; Harriet&mdash;Mrs. Smith&mdash;who still survives and
lives in great retirement with her eldest daughter at Guelph; and
Appolonia, who died at the early age of eighteen. Charles, the only
son, lived at Newark, and his surviving children are Mr. James B.
Secord, of Niagara, and Alicia, Mrs. Isaac Cockburn, of
Gravenhurst.</p>
<p>Two daughters were born to Mr. and Mrs. Secord subsequent to the
war. Hannah, who was married to Mr. Carthew, of Guelph. and died in
1884, leaving several sons, and Laura, who was married to Dr.
Clarke, of Palmerston, and died young, leaving one daughter,
Laura.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith relates that she very well remembers her mother
setting off for St. David's, ostensibly to see her brother Charles,
who lay sick at the mill, and her father's ill-concealed agitation
during that trying day. What must the night have been to him? She
also relates that during the short occupation of Queenston by the
invaders, their soldiery were very tyrannical, entering the houses
and stores to look for money and help themselves to plunder, and
even destroying the bedding, by ripping it up with their swords and
bayonets, in the search. Mrs. Secord who had a store of Spanish
doubloons, heirlooms, saved them by throwing them into a cauldron
of water which hung on a crane over a blazing fire. In this she
unconsciously emulated the ready wit of one of her husband's
Huguenot progenitors, a lady, who during the persecution that
followed the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, at a period of
domiciliary search for incriminating proofs of unorthodoxy, is said
to have thrown a copy of the Bible&mdash;a doubly precious treasure
in those days&mdash;into a churn of milk from whence it was
afterwards rescued little the worse, thanks to heavy binding and
strong clasps.</p>
<p>Envy having sent a shaft at even so warm and patriotic a breast
as that of Mrs. Secord, Col. Fitzgibbon sent her a certificate,
dated only a short time before his death, vouching to the facts of
the heroic deed. It was evidently one of the cruel necessities of
this hard life. The certificate runs as follows:</p>
<a name="pageiv"><!-- Begin Page IV --></a>
<center>
<p>FITZGIBBON'S CERTIFICATE.</p></center>
<p class="letter">"I do hereby certify that Mrs. Secord, the wife
of James Secord, of Chippewa, Esq., did, in the month of June,
1813, walk from her house in the village of St. David's to Decamp's
house in Thorold, by a circuitous route of about twenty miles,
partly through the woods, to acquaint me that the enemy intended to
attempt by surprise to capture a detachment of the 49th Regiment,
then under my command; she having obtained such knowledge from good
authority, as the event proved. Mrs. Secord was a person of slight
and delicate frame; and made the effort in weather excessively
warm, and I dreaded at the time that she must suffer in health in
consequence of fatigue and anxiety, she having been exposed to
danger from the enemy, through whose line of communication she had
to pass. The attempt was made on my detachment by the enemy, and
his detachment, consisting of upwards of 500 men, with a
field-piece and fifty dragoons, was captured in consequence. I
write this certificate in a moment of much hurry and from memory,
and it is, therefore, thus brief.<br>
<br>
 "(Signed) JAMES FITZGIBBON,<br>
 "<i>Formerly Lieutenant in the 49th Regiment</i>."</p>
<p>It is well to consider this great achievement of Mrs. Secord
carefully, that we may be the better able to realize the greatness
of the feat. To assist in so doing, it will not be amiss to quote
the following, from Coffin's <i>Chronicles of the War</i>, bearing
on the prudential reasons of Proctor's retreat at Moravian Town.
"But whether for advance or for retreat, the by-paths of the forest
intermediate were such as the macadamized and locomotive
imagination of the present day cannot encompass. A backwoodsman,
laden with his axe, wading here, ploutering there, stumbling over
rotted trees, protruding stumps, a bit of half-submerged corduroy
road for one short space, then an adhesive clay bank, then a mile
or two or more of black muck swamp, may,
possibly,&mdash;clay-clogged and footsore, and with much pain in
the small of his back,&mdash;find himself at sundown at the foot of
a hemlock or cedar, with a fire at his feet, having done manfully
about ten miles for his day's work." This was written of a time of
year when the fall rains predict an approaching winter. Mrs.
Secord's exploit was made on the 23rd of June, a time when the
early summer rains that set the fruit and consecrate an abundant
harvest with their blessing, nevertheless make clay banks slippery,
and streams swift, and of these latter the whole Niagara district
was full. Many have now been diverted and some dried up. I am happy
to be able to give my readers the heroine's own simple account of
her journey, as furnished me by the courtesy of Mr. Benson J.
Lossing, author of the "Pictorial Field Book of the War of 1812,"
to whom the aged lady in 1862 recounted it in a letter (given in a
note in Mr. Lossing's book), the historian, on his visit to
Chippewa in 1860, having failed to see her. She was then
eighty-five years of age.</p>
<a name="pagev"><!-- Begin Page V --></a>
<p>"DEAR SIR,&mdash;I will tell you the story in a few words.</p>
<p>"After going to St. David's and the recovery of Mr. Secord, we
returned again to Queenston, where my courage again was much tried.
It was there I gained the secret plan laid to capture Captain
Fitzgibbon and his party. I was determined, if possible, to save
them. I had much difficulty in getting through the American guards.
They were ten miles out in the country. [Footnote: The American
sentries were out ten miles into the country; that is, at any point
commanding a possible line of communication within a radius of ten
miles from Fort George, Mrs. Secord might come upon an American
sentry. The deep woods, therefore, were her only security. These
she must thread to the best of her ability, with what knowledge she
might possess of the woodman's craft, for even a blazed path was
not safe. And by this means she must get out of American cover and
into British lines. To do this she must take a most circuitous
route, as she tells us, all round "by Twelve-mile Creek," whose
port is St. Catharines, climbing the ridge that is now cut through
by the Welland Canal, and thus doubling upon what would have been
the straight route, and coming on Fitzgibbon from the back, from
the way of his supports, for Major de Haren lay at Twelve-mile
Creek, but not within several miles of where the heroine crossed
it. And it was dark, and within a few hours of the intended
surprise when she reached it. To go to De Haren, even though it
might have been nearer at that point&mdash;it may not have been so,
however&mdash;was a greater risk to Fitzgibbon, whose safety she
was labouring to secure, than to send him aid which might only
reach him after the event. Forgetting her exhaustion she proceeds,
fulfils her errand, and saves her country. <i>And shall that
country let her memory die</i>?] When I came to a field belonging
to a Mr. De Cou, in the neighbourhood of the Beaver Dams, I then
had walked nineteen miles. By that time daylight had left me. I yet
had a swift stream of water (Twelve-mile Creek) to cross over on an
old fallen tree, and to climb a high hill, which fatigued me very
much.</p>
<p>"Before I arrived at the encampment of the Indians, as I
approached they all arose with one of their war yells, which,
indeed, awed me. You may imagine what my feelings were to behold so
many savages. With forced courage I went to one of the chiefs, told
him I had great news for his commander, and that he must take me to
him or they would all be lost. He did not understand me, but said,
'Woman! What does woman want here?' The scene by moonlight to some
might have been grand, but to a weak woman certainly terrifying.
With difficulty I got one of the chiefs to go with me to their
commander. With the intelligence I gave him he formed his plans and
saved his country. I have ever found the brave and noble Colonel
Fitzgibbon a friend to me. May he prosper in the world to come as
he has done in this.</p>
LAURA SECORD. <br>
 "CHIPPEWA, U.C., Feb. 18, 1861." <br>

<p>Mr. Lossing further adds in his letter to me:</p>
<p>"When, in the summer of 1860, the Prince of Wales visited
Queenston the veteran soldiers of the Canada side of the Niagara
frontier signed an address to his Royal Highness; Mrs. Secord
claimed the privilege of signing it. 'Wherefore?' was asked. She
told her story, and it was allowed that she <a name="pagevi">
<!-- Begin Page VI --></a> eminently deserved a place among the
signers. Her story was repeated to the Prince. He was greatly
interested, and learning that the heroine had not much of this
world's goods, sent her $500 soon after his return home, in
attestation of his appreciation of her patriotism."</p>
<p>Her sole surviving daughter at this date, says the gift was
carried to her mother by ten gentlemen who had formed part of the
Prince's suite.</p>
<p>A correspondent at Drummondville, to whom I am indebted for
several Valuable particulars, says: "Mrs. Laura Second is
remembered here as a fine, tall, strong woman. Strong, too, in
mind, purpose, determination, and yet womanly and maternal withal.
She is spoken of as <i>indeed a brave woman</i>, of strong
patriotism and courage.</p>
<p>"The difficulties and dangers then, were those of anew,
uncleared, pathless country increased by lurking foes, and by
wandering, untaught Indians.</p>
<p>"In connection with her chief act of heroism the following
anecdote has been told me:&mdash;Three American soldiers called at
her log house at Queenston to ask for water. One of them said, 'You
have a nice place here, missis, when we come for good to this
country we'll divide the land, and I'll take this here for my
share.' Mrs. Secord was so nettled by the thoughts expressed that
although the men were civil and respectful, she replied sharply,
'You scoundrel you, all you'll ever get here will be six feet of
earth!'</p>
<p>"When they were gone her heart reproached her for her heat,
because the men had not molested her nor her property." (Yet her
indignation was righteous, since they were invaders in the worst
sense of the term, having no lawful cause for their invasion.) "Two
days after two of the men returned. They said to Mrs. Secord, 'You
were right about the six feet of earth, missis! The third man had
been killed."</p>
<p>In speaking of the heroine, Mr. James B. Secord, of Niagara,
says in a letter to me, "My grandmother was of a modest
disposition, and did not care to have her exploit mentioned, as she
did not think she had done any thing extraordinary. She was the
very last one to mention the affair, and unless asked would never
say any thing about it."</p>
<p>This noble-minded and heroic woman died in 1868, aged
ninety-three years. She lies in Drummondville Churchyard, by the
side of the husband she loved so well. Nothing but a simple
headstone, half defaced, marks the place where the sacred ashes
lie. But surely we who enjoy the happiness she so largely secured
for us, we who have known how to honour Brock and Brant, will also
know how to, honour Tecumseh and LAURA SECORD; the heroine as well
as the heroes of our Province&mdash;of our common
Dominion&mdash;and will no longer delay to do it, lest Time should
snatch the happy opportunity from us.</p>

<h2>LAURA SECORD:<br>
 THE HEROINE OF THE WAR OF 1812.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<h4>SCENE 1.&mdash;<i>Queenston. A farmhouse</i>.</h4>
<p>John Penn, a Quaker, <i>is seated on a chair tilted against the
wall</i>. Mr. Secord, <i>his arm in a sling, reclines on a couch,
against the end of which a crutch is is placed</i>. Mrs. Secord,
<i>occupies a rocking-chair near the lounge</i>. Charlie, <i>a
little fellow of four, is seated on her lap holding a ball of yarn
from which she is knitting</i>. Charlotte, <i>a girl of twelve, is
seated on a stool set a little in rear of the couch; she has a
lesson-book in her hand</i>. Harriet, <i>a girl of ten, occupies a
stool near her sister, and has a slate on her lap. All are
listening intently to the</i> Quaker, <i>who is speaking</i>.</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i>. The midnight sky, set thick with shining
points,<br>
 Hung watchingly, while from a band of gloom<br>
 That belted in the gloomier woods, stole forth<br>
 Foreshortened forms of grosser shade, all barred<br>
 With lines of denser blackness, dexter-borne.<br>
 Rank after rank, they came, out of the dark,<br>
 So silently no pebble crunched beneath<br>
 Their feet more sharp than did a woodchuck stir.<br>
 And so came on the foe all stealthily,<br>
 And found their guns a-limber, fires ablaze,<br>
 And men in calm repose.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With
bay'nets fixed<br>
 The section in advance fell on the camp,<br>
 And killed the first two sentries, whose sharp cries<br>
 Alarmed a third, who fired, and firing, fled.<br>
 This roused the guard, but "Forward!" was the word,<br>
 And on we rushed, slaying full many a man<br>
 Who woke not in this world.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
'larum given,<br>
 <a name="page012"><!-- Begin Page 12 --></a> A-sudden rose such
hubbub and confusion<br>
 As is made by belching earthquake. Waked from sleep,<br>
 Men stumbled over men, and angry cries<br>
 Resounded. Surprised, yet blenching not,<br>
 Muskets were seized and shots at random fired<br>
 E'en as they fled. Yet rallied they when ours,<br>
 At word from Harvey, fell into line,<br>
 And stood, right 'mid the fires, to flint their locks&mdash;<br>
 An awful moment!&mdash;<br>
 As amid raging storms the warring heaven<br>
 Falls sudden silent, and concentrates force<br>
 To launch some scathing bolt upon the earth,<br>
 So hung the foe, hid in portentous gloom,<br>
 While in the lurid light ours halted. Quick,<br>
 Red volcanic fire burst from their lines<br>
 And mowed us where we stood!<br>
 Full many a trembling hand that set a flint<br>
 Fell lifeless ere it clicked: <i>yet silent all</i>&mdash;<br>
 Save groans of wounded&mdash;till our rods struck home;<br>
 Then, flashing fire for fire, forward we rushed<br>
 And scattered them like chaff before the wind.<br>
 The King's Own turned their left; the Forty-ninth,<br>
 At point of bay'net, pushed the charge, and took<br>
 Their guns, they fighting valiantly, but wild,<br>
 Having no rallying point, their leaders both<br>
 Lying the while all snug at Jemmy Gap's.<br>
 And so the men gave in at last, and fled,<br>
 And Stony Creek was ours.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Brave Harvey! Gallantly planned and
carried.<br>
 The stroke is good, the consequences better.<br>
 Cooped as he is in George, the foe will lack<br>
 His forage, and perforce must&mdash;eat his stores;<br>
 For Yeo holds the lake, and on the land<br>
 His range is scarce beyond his guns. And more,<br>
 He is the less by these of men to move<br>
 On salient points, and long as we hold firm<br>
 <a name="page013"><!-- Begin Page 13 --></a> At Erie, Burlington,
and Stony Creek,<br>
 He's like the wretched bird, he "can't get out."</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. You speak, friend Penn, as if you saw the
fight,<br>
 Not like a simple bearer of the news.</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i>. Why, so I did.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. You did! Pray tell us how it was;<br>
 For ever have I heard that Quakers shunned<br>
 The sight of blood.</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i>. None more than I.<br>
 Yet innate forces sometimes tell o'er use<br>
 Against our will. But this was how it happed:<br>
 Thou seest, Mistress Secord, I'd a load<br>
 Of sound potatoes, that I thought to take<br>
 To Vincent's camp, but on the way I met<br>
 A British officer, who challenged me; saith he,<br>
 "Friend, whither bound?" "Up to the Heights," say I,<br>
 "To sell my wares." "Better," saith he,<br>
 "Go to the Yankee camp; they'll pay a price<br>
 Just double ours, for we are short of cash."<br>
 "I'll risk the pay," say I, "for British troops;<br>
 Nay, if we're poor, I can afford the load,<br>
 And p'rhaps another, for my country's good."<br>
 "And say'st thou so, my Quaker! Yet," saith he,<br>
 "I hear you Quakers will not strike a blow<br>
 To guard your country's rights, nor yet your own."<br>
 "No, but we'll hold the stakes," cried I. He laughed.<br>
 "Can't you do more, my friend?" quoth he, "I need<br>
 A closer knowledge of the Yankee camp:<br>
 How strong it is, and how it lies. A brush<br>
 Is imminent, and one must win, you know<br>
 Shall they?"<br>
 His manner was so earnest that, before<br>
 I knew, I cried, "Not if I know it, man!"<br>
 With a bright smile he answered me, "There spoke<br>
 A Briton." Then he directed me<br>
 How I might sell my load, what I should mark,<br>
 <a name="page014"><!-- Begin Page 14 --></a> And when report to
him my observations.<br>
 So, after dusk, I met him once again,<br>
 And told him all I knew. It pleased him much.<br>
 Warmly he shook my hand. "I am," saith he,<br>
 "Lieutenant-Colonel Harvey. Should it hap<br>
 That I can ever serve you, let me know."</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. And then you stayed to see the end of
it?</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i>. Mistress, I did. Somewhat against my creed,<br>
 I freely own; for what should I, a Quaker,<br>
 E'er have to do with soldiers, men of blood!<br>
 I mean no slight to you, James.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i> (<i>laughing</i>). No, no! go on.</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i>. Well, when I thought how tired poor Dobbin
was,<br>
 How late the hour, and that 'twould be a week<br>
 Before I'd hear how Harvey sped that night,<br>
 I thought I'd stay and see the matter out;<br>
 The more, because I kind o' felt as if<br>
 Whatever happed I'd had a hand in it.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. And pray where did you hide? for hide you
must,<br>
 So near the Yankee lines.</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i>. It wasn't hard to do; I knew the ground,<br>
 Being a hired boy on that very farm,<br>
 Now Jemmy Gap's. There was an elm, where once<br>
 I used to sit and watch for chipmunks, that I clomb,<br>
 And from its shade could see the Yankee camp,<br>
 Its straggling line, its fires, its careless watch;<br>
 And from the first I knew the fight was ours,<br>
 If Harvey struck that night.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Ha! ha! friend John, thine is a soldier's
brain<br>
 Beneath that Quaker hat.</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i> (<i>in some embarrassment, rising</i>).<br>
 No, no, I am a man of peace, and hate<br>
 The very name of war. I must be gone.</p>
<p>(<i>To Mrs. Secord</i>.) My woman longs to see thee,
Mistress.<br>
 Good-bye to all.</p>
<p><i>The Little Girls</i> (<i>rising</i>). Good-bye, sir.</p>
<a name="page015"><!-- Begin Page 15 --></a>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Good-bye, John,<br>
 'Twould please me much to see my friend again,<br>
 But war blots out the sweet amenities<br>
 Of life. Give her my love.</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i>. I will.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i> (<i>rising and taking his crutch</i>). I'll
walk a piece with you, friend Penn,<br>
 And see you past the lines.</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>His little daughter</i>, HARRIET, <i>hands him
his hat</i>.</p>
<p><i>Quaker</i>. That's right, 'twill do thee good:<br>
 Thy wounds have left thee like an ailing girl,<br>
 So poor and pale.</p>

 That's not invaded, even one's books<br>
 Borrowed without one's leave. I hate it all!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. We must be patient, dear, it cannot
last.</p>
<p><i>Harriet</i>. Oh, if we girls were boys, or Charles a man!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Poor baby Charles! See, he's asleep; and
now,<br>
 Dear girls, seeing we cannot fight, we'll pray<br>
 That peace may come again, for strife and blood,<br>
 Though wisely spent, are taxes hard to pay.<br>
 But come, 'tis late! See Charlie's dropt asleep;<br>
 Sing first your evening hymn, and then to bed.<br>
 I'll lay the darling down.</p>

down in much agitation</i>.</h4>
<center><i>Enter</i> MR. SECORD.</center>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i> (<i>springing to meet him</i>). Oh, James,
where have you been?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. I did but ramble through the pasture,
dear,<br>
 And round the orchard. 'Twas so sweet and still.<br>
 Save for the echo of the sentry's tread<br>
 O'er the hard road, it might have been old times.<br>
 But&mdash;but&mdash;you're agitated, dear; what's wrong?<br>
 I see our unasked visitors were here.<br>
 Was that&mdash;?</p>
<a name="page019"><!-- Begin Page 19 --></a>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Not that; yet that. Oh, James, I scarce can
bear<br>
 The stormy swell that surges o'er my heart,<br>
 Awaked by what they have revealed this night.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Dear wife, what is't?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Oh, sit you down and rest, for you will
need<br>
 All strength you may command to hear me tell.</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>Mr. Secord sits down, his wife by him</i>.</p>
That saucy fellow, Winter, and a guard<br>
 Came and demanded supper; and, of course,<br>
 They had to get it. Pete and Flos I left<br>
 To wait on them, but soon they sent them off,<br>
 Their jugs supplied,&mdash;and fell a-talking, loud,<br>
 As in defiance, of some private plan<br>
 To make the British wince. Word followed word,<br>
 Till I, who could not help but hear their gibes,<br>
 Suspected mischief, and, listening, learned the whole.<br>
 To-morrow night a large detachment leaves<br>
 Fort George for Beaver Dam. Five hundred men,<br>
 With some dragoons, artillery, and a train<br>
 Of baggage-waggons, under Boerstler, go<br>
 To fall upon Fitzgibbon by surprise,<br>
 Capture the stores, and pay for Stony Creek.<br>

<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. My God! and here am I, a paroled cripple!<br>
 Oh, Canada, my chosen country! Now&mdash;<br>
 Is't now, in this thy dearest strait, I fail?<br>
 I, who for thee would pour my blood with joy&mdash;<br>
 Would give my life for thy prosperity&mdash;<br>
 Most I stand by, and see thy foes prevail<br>
 Without one thrust?</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>In his agitation he rises</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Oh, calm thee, dear; thy strength is all to
me.<br>
 Fitzgibbon shall be warned, or aid be sent.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. But how, wife? how? Let this attempt
succeed,<br>
 As well it may, and vain last year's success;<br>
 In vain fell Brock: in vain was Queenston fought:<br>
 In vain we pour out blood and gold in streams:<br>
 <a name="page020"><!-- Begin Page 20 --></a> For Dearborn then may
push his heavy force<br>
 Along the lakes, with long odds in his favour.<br>
 And I, unhappy wretch, in such a strait<br>
 Am here, unfit for service. Thirty men<br>
 Are all Fitzgibbon has to guard the stores<br>
 And keep a road 'twixt Bisshopp and De Haren.<br>
 Those stores, that road, would give the Yankee all.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Why, be content now, dear. Had we not
heard,<br>
 This plot might have passed on to its dire end,<br>
 Like the pale owl that noiseless cleaves the dark,<br>
 And, on its dreaming prey, swoops with fell claw.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. What better is it?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. This; that myself will go to Beaver Dam,<br>
 And warn Fitzgibbon: there is yet a day.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Thou! thou take a task at which a man might
shrink?<br>
 No, no, dear wife! Not so.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Ay, prithee, let me go;<br>
 'Tis not so far. And I can pass unharmed<br>
 Where you would be made prisoner, or worse.<br>
 They'll not hurt me&mdash;my sex is my protection.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Oh, not in times like these. Let them
suspect<br>
 A shadow wrong, and neither sex, nor tears,<br>
 Nor tenderness would save thy fate.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Fear not for me. I'll be for once so
wise<br>
 The sentries shall e'en put me on my way.<br>
 Once past the lines, the dove is not more swift<br>
 Nor sure to find her distant home than I<br>
 To reach Fitzgibbon. Say I may go.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i> (<i>putting his arm 'round her tenderly</i>).
How can I let thee go? Thy tender feet<br>
 Would bleed ere half the way was done. Thy strength<br>
 Would fail 'twixt the rough road and summer heat,<br>
 And in some, gloomy depth, faint and alone,<br>
 Thou would'st lie down to die. Or, chased and hurt<br>
 By wolf or catamount, thy task undone,<br>
 <a name="page021"><!-- Begin Page 21 --></a> Thy precious life
would then be thrown away.<br>
 I cannot let thee go.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Not thrown away! Nay, say not that, dear
James.<br>
 No life is thrown away that's spent in doing duty.<br>
 But why raise up these phantoms of dismay?<br>
 I did not so when, at our country's call,<br>
 You leapt to answer. Said I one word<br>
 To keep you back? and yet my risk was greater<br>
 Then than now&mdash;a woman left with children<br>
 On a frontier farm, where yelling savages,<br>
 Urged on, or led, by renegades, might burn,<br>
 And kill, and outrage with impunity<br>
 Under the name of war. Yet I blenched not,<br>
 But helped you clean your musket, clasped your belt,<br>
 And sent you forth, with many a cheery word.<br>
 Did I not so?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Thou didst indeed, dear wife, thou didst.<br>
 But yet,&mdash;<br>
 I cannot let thee go, my darling.<br>
 Did I not promise in our marriage vow,<br>
 And to thy mother, to guard thee as myself.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. And so you will if now you let me go.<br>
 For you would go yourself, without a word<br>
 Of parley, were you able; leaving me<br>
 The while in His good hands; not doubting once<br>
 But I was willing. Leave me there now, James,<br>
 And let me go; it is our country calls.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Ah, dearest wife, thou dost not realize<br>
 All my deep promise, "guard thee as myself?"<br>
 I meant to guard thee doubly, trebly more.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. There you were wrong. The law says
"<i>as</i> thyself<br>
 Thou shalt regard thy neighbour."</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. My neighbour! Then is that all that thou
art<br>
 To me, thy husband? Shame! thou lovest me not.<br>
 My neighbour!</p>
<a name="page022"><!-- Begin Page 22 --></a>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Why now, fond ingrate! What saith <i>the
Book?</i><br>
 "THE GOOD, with all thy soul and mind and strength;<br>
 Thy neighbour as thyself." Thou must <i>not</i> love<br>
 Thyself, nor me, as thou <i>must</i> love the Good.<br>
 Therefore, I am thy neighbour; loved as thyself:<br>
 And as thyself wouldst go to warn Fitzgibbon<br>
 If thou wert able, so I, being able,<br>
 Thou must let me go&mdash;thy other self.<br>
 Pray let me go!</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). Thou shalt, dear wife,
thou shalt. I'll say no more.<br>
 Thy courage meets the occasion. Hope shall be<br>
 My standard-bearer, and put to shame<br>
 The cohorts black anxiety calls up.<br>
 But how shall I explain to prying folks<br>
 Thine absence?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Say I am gone to see my brother,<br>
 'Tis known he's sick; and if I venture now<br>
 'Twill serve to make the plot seem still secure.<br>
 I must start early.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Yet not too soon, lest ill surmise<br>
 Aroused by guilty conscience doubt thy aim.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. That's true.<br>
 Yet at this time of year do travellers start<br>
 Almost at dawn to avoid the midday heats.<br>
 Tell not the children whither I am bound;<br>
 Poor darlings! Soon enough anxiety<br>
 Will fall upon them; 'tis the heritage<br>
 Of all; high, low, rich, poor; he chiefly blest<br>
 Who travels farthest ere he meets the foe.<br>
 There's much to do to leave the household straight,<br>
 I'll not retire to-night.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Oh, yes, dear wife, thou shalt not spend thy
strength<br>
 On household duties, for thou'lt need it all<br>
 Ere thy long task be done. O, but I fear&mdash;</p>
<a name="page023"><!-- Begin Page 23 --></a>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i> (<i>quickly</i>). Fear nothing!<br>
 Trust heaven and do your best, is wiser.<br>
 Should I meet harm,'twill be in doing duty:<br>
 Fail I shall not!</p>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Retire, dear wife, and rest; I'll watch the
hours<br>
 Beside thee.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. No need to watch me, James, I shall
awake.</p>
<br>
 [<i>Aside</i>. And yet perhaps 'tis best.<br>
 If he wake now he'll sleep to-morrow<br>
 Perforce of nature; and banish thus<br>
 Some hours of sad anxiety.]<br>

<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. I'd better watch.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Well then, to please you! But call me on the
turn<br>
 Of night, lest I should lose an hour or two<br>
 Of cooler travel.</p>

<h4>SCENE 4&mdash;<i>Daybreak on the</i> 23<i>rd June</i>,
1813.</h4>
<center><i>The porch of</i> Mr. Secord's <i>farmhouse. A garden
path, with a gate that opens on to the high road from Newark to
Twelve-Mile Creek</i>.<br>

<p><i>Enter</i> JAMES SECORD <i>and his wife</i>.</p></center>
<p><i>Mr. Secord</i>. Heaven speed thee, then, dear wife. I'll try
to bear<br>
 The dreadful pangs of helplessness and dread<br>
 With calm demeanour, if a bursting heart.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Then will you taste a woman's common lot<br>
 In times of strait, while I essay man's r&ocirc;le<br>
 Of fierce activity. We will compare<br>
 When I return. Now, fare-thee-well, my husband.</p>
<p>(<i>Fearful of being observed, they part without an embrace</i>.
Mrs. Secord <i>walks down the garden slowly, and gathers a few
clove pinks; a the gate she stops as though the latch were
troublesome, raises the flowers to her lips, and makes a slight
salute to her husband, who yet stands within the porch watching
<a name="page024"><!-- Begin Page 24 --></a> her. She then rapidly
pursues her way, but soon encounters an American sentry, whom she
essays to pass with a nod and a smile: the man prevents her by
bringing his musket to the charge, and challenging</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Why do you stop me?</p>
<p><i>Sentry</i>. Where is your pass?<br>
 You know that none may take the road without one.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. But surely I may go to milk my cow,<br>
 Yonder she is.</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>A cow is seen in the clearing</i>.</p>
She's wandered in the night.<br>
 I'll drive her back again, poor thing.<br>
 She likes new pasture best, as well she may.<br>

<p><i>Sentry</i>. Keep you your kine at home, you've land
enough.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Why, that's our land, and those our barns
and sheds.</p>
<p><i>Sentry</i>. Well, pass!</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>He suddenly observes the flowers</i>.</p>
<p>But where's your milking pail?<br>
 I guess the bunch of flowers is for the cow.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i> (<i>gently</i>). You are too rough! The pinks
weep dewy tears<br>
 Upon my hand to chide you. There, take them;</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>She offers him the flowers</i>.</p>
<p>And let their fragrance teach you courtesy,<br>
 At least to women. You can watch me.</p>
<p><i>Sentry</i>. Madam, suspicion blunts politeness. Pass.<br>
 I'll take your flowers, and thank you, too;<br>
 'Tis long since that I saw their fellows in<br>
 The old folks' garden.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Secord <i>crosses the road, takes a rail out of the fence,
which she replaces after having passed into the clearing, and
proceeds to the barn, whence she brings an old pail, luckily left
there, and approaches the cow</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i> (<i>aside</i>). Could I but get her out of
sight, I'd drive<br>
 The creature round the other way, and go<br>
 My own. Pray Heaven the sentry watch me not<br>
 Too closely; his manner roused my fears.</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>She waves her hand at the cow, which moves
on</i>.</p>
Co' boss! co' boss. Sh! Haste thee, poor cow;<br>
 <a name="page025"><!-- Begin Page 25 --></a> Fly from me! though
never didst thou yet:<br>
 Nor should'st do now, but for the stake I play.<br>

<p class="stage">[<i>Both disappear in the bush</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sentry</i> (<i>apostrophising the disappearing "enemy"</i>).
Well, mistress, were you gentle as your face,<br>
 The creature wouldn't run you such a race.<br>
 It serves you right! The cows my Anna milks,<br>
 Come at her call, like chickens. O, sweet voice,<br>
 When shall I hear you next? Even as I pace<br>
 With measured step this hot and dusty road,<br>
 The soft June breezes take your tones, and call,<br>
 "Come, Henry, come." Would that I could!<br>
 Would I had never joined!<br>
 But my hot blood o'ermastered my cool sense,<br>
 Nor let me see that always is not bought<br>
 Honour by arms, but often dire disgrace.<br>
 For so it is, as now I clearly see,<br>
 We let the animal within remain<br>
 Unbroke, till neither gyve nor gear will serve<br>
 To steady him, only a knock-down blow.<br>
 Had I, and others, too, within the ranks,<br>
 Haltered our coltish blood, we should have found<br>
 That hate to England, not our country's name<br>
 And weal, impelled mad Madison upon this war;<br>
 And shut the mouths of thousand higher men<br>
 Than he.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
a lesson may I learn<br>
 So as to ne'er forget, that in the heat of words<br>
 Sparks oft are struck that should be straightway quenched<br>
 In cool reflection; not enlarged and fed<br>
 With passionate tinder, till a flame is blown<br>
 That reaches past our bonds, and leaves behind<br>
 Black, sullen stumps where once the green trees grew.<br>
 If honour's what we want, there's room enough<br>
 For that, and wild adventure, too, in the West,<br>
 At half the cost of war, in opening up<br>
 A road shall reach the great Pacific.<br>

 Casket that holds my jewels! If no more<br>
 My happy eyes rest on thy lowly roof,<br>
 If never more my ears drink in the sounds<br>
 Of sweeter music, in your loving tones,<br>
 My darlings, than e'er was drawn from harp<br>
 The best attuned, by wandering Aeolus,<br>
 Then let my memory, like some fond relic laid<br>
 In musk and lavender, softly exhale<br>
 A thousand tender thoughts to soothe and bless;<br>
 And let my love hide in your heart of hearts,<br>
 And with ethereal touch control your lives,<br>
 Till in that better home we meet again.</p>

<h3>ACT II.</h3>
<h4>SCENE 1.&mdash;<i>The great kitchen at St. David's Mill.
Breakfast-time</i>.</h4>
<center><i>At the board are seated the</i> Widow Stephen Secord,
Sergeant George Mosier, <i>and little</i> Tom. Babette <i>is
waiting at table</i>.</center>
<p><i>Widow</i>. 'Tis pitiful to see one's land go waste<br>
 For want of labour, and the summer days,<br>
 So rich in blessing, spend their fruitful force<br>
 On barren furrows. And then to think<br>
 That over both the Provinces it is the same,&mdash;<br>
 No men to till the land, because the war<br>
 Needs every one. God knows how we shall feed<br>
 Next year: small crop, small grist,&mdash;a double loss<br>
 To me. The times are anxious.<br>
 (<i>To Sergeant Mosier</i>.) Have you news?</p>
<p><i>Sergeant</i>. Not much, ma'am, all is pretty quiet still<br>
 Since Harvey struck them dumb at Stony Creek.<br>
 Along the Lake bold Yeo holds them fast,<br>
 And, Eric-way, Bisshopp and Evans back him.<br>
 Thus stand we now; but Proctor's all too slow.<br>
 O had we Brock again, bold, wise, and prompt,<br>
 That foreign rag that floats o'er Newark's spires<br>
 Would soon go down, and England's ensign up.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. Ah, was he not a man! and yet so sweet,<br>
 So courteous, and so gentle.</p>
<p><i>Babette</i>. <i>Ah, oui, madame</i>.<br>
 So kind! not one rough word he ever had,<br>
 The <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>, but bow so low, "<i>Merci,
Babette</i>,"<br>
 For glass of milk, <i>et petit chose comme &ccedil;a</i>.<br>
 Ah, long ago it must be he was French:<br>
 Some <i>grand seigneur, sans doute</i>, in Guernsey then.<br>
 Ah the brave man, madame, <i>c&eacute; hero la!</i></p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. Yes, brave indeed, Babette, but English,
English.<br>
 Oh, bravery, good girl, is born of noble hearts,<br>
 And calls the world its country, and its sex<br>
 Humanity.</p>
<a name="page028"><!-- Begin Page 28 --></a>
<p><i>Babette</i>. Madame?</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. You do not understand me, not; but you<br>
 Were very brave and noble-hearted when<br>
 You faced the wolf that scented the young lambs.</p>
<p><i>Babette</i>. <i>Brave! moi!</i> Madame is kind to say it
so.<br>
 But bravery of women&mdash;what is that<br>
 To bravery of man?</p>
<p><i>Tom</i>. An' that's just what I said to Hatty, mother,<br>
 When she declared that Aunty Laura was<br>
 As brave as soldiers, 'cause she went an' fetched<br>
 Poor Uncle James from off the battlefield.<br>
 After the fight was over. That wasn't much!</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. You're but an ignorant little boy, my son,<br>
 But might be wiser were you not so pert.</p>
<p><i>Sergeant</i>. I heard not that before, ma'am.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. Did you not?<br>
 'Tis very true. Upon that dreadful day,<br>
 After Brock fell, and in the second fight,<br>
 When with the Lincoln men and Forty-first<br>
 Sheaffe led the attack, poor Captain Secord dropped,<br>
 Shot, leg and shoulder, and bleeding there he lay,<br>
 With numbers more, when evening fell; for means<br>
 Were small to deal with wounded men, and all,<br>
 Soldiers and citizens, were spent and worn<br>
 With cruel trials. So when she learned he lay<br>
 Among the wounded, his young wife took up<br>
 A lantern in her hand, and searched the field&mdash;<br>
 Whence sobs and groans and cries rose up to heaven<br>
 And paled the tearful stars&mdash;until she found<br>
 The man she loved, not sure that life remained.<br>
 Then binding him as best she might, she bore,<br>
 With some kind aid, the fainting body home,&mdash;<br>
 If home it could be called where rabid hate<br>
 Had spent its lawless rage in deeds of spite;<br>
 Where walls and roof were torn with many balls,<br>
 And shelter scarce was found.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That
very night,<br>
 <a name="page029"><!-- Begin Page 29 --></a> Distrustful lest the
foe, repulsed and wild,<br>
 Should launch again his heavier forces o'er<br>
 The flood, she moved her terror-stricken girls&mdash;<br>
 Four tender creatures&mdash;and her infant boy,<br>
 Her wounded husband and her two young slaves,<br>
 'Neath cover of thick darkness to the farm,<br>
 A mile beyond: a feat even for a man.<br>
 And then she set her woman's wit and love<br>
 To the long task of nursing back to health<br>
 Her husband, much exhaust through loss of blood,<br>
 and all the angry heat of gunshot wounds.<br>
 But James will never be himself again<br>
 Despite her care.</p>
<p><i>Sergeant</i>. 'Twas well and bravely done.<br>
 Yet oft I think the women of these days<br>
 Degenerate to those I knew in youth.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. You're hasty, Sergeant, already hath this war<br>
 Shown many a young and delicate woman<br>
 A very hero for&mdash;her hero's sake;<br>
 Nay, more, for others'. She, our neighbour there<br>
 At Queenston, who when our troops stood still,<br>
 Weary and breathless, took her young babe,<br>
 Her husband under arms among the rest,<br>
 And cooked and carried for them on the field:<br>
 Was she not one in whom the heroic blood<br>
 Ran thick and strong as e'er in times gone by?<br>
 O Canada, thy soil is broadcast strown<br>
 With noble deeds: a plague on him, I say,<br>
 Who follows with worse seed!</p>
<p>(<i>She rises and prepares for making pies</i>. Babette
<i>clears off the table, and</i> Sergeant George <i>smokes his
pipe, sitting close to the open chimney, now filled with fresh
branches of spruce and cedar</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Sergeant</i>. Well, mistress, p'rhaps you're right; old folks
aye think<br>
 Old times the best; but now your words recall<br>
 The name of one, the bravest of her sex,<br>
 <a name="page030"><!-- Begin Page 30 --></a> So far as e'er I saw,
save, p'rhaps, the Baroness.<br>
 Tender of frame, most gentle, softly raised,<br>
 And young, the Lady Harriet Acland shared,<br>
 With other dames whose husbands held commands,<br>
 The rough campaign of 'Seventy-six.<br>
 But her lot fell so heavy, and withal<br>
 She showed such spirit, cheerfulness, and love,<br>
 Her name became a watchword in the ranks.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. And what about her, Sergeant?</p>
<p><i>Sergeant</i>. Well, mistress, as you ask I'll tell the
tale:<br>
 She was the wife of Major John Dyke-Acland,<br>
 An officer of Grenadiers, then joined<br>
 To Highland Frazer's arm of Burgoyne's troops.<br>
 At Chambl&eacute;e he was wounded. Leaving the Fort,<br>
 His wife crossed lake and land, by means so rough<br>
 As tried the strength of men, to nurse him.<br>
 Recovered; next he fought Ticonderoga,<br>
 And there was badly wounded. Lake Champlain<br>
 She traversed to his aid in just a batteau.<br>
 No sooner was he better, than again<br>
 He joined his men, always the first to move,<br>
 And so alert their situation was,<br>
 That all slept in their clothes. In such a time<br>
 The Major's tent took fire, and he, that night,<br>
 But for a sergeant's care, who dragged him out,<br>
 Had lost his life. Twice saved he was;<br>
 For thinking that his wife still lay within,<br>
 Burning to death, he broke away,<br>
 And plunged into the fiery mass. But she,<br>
 Scarce half awake, had crept from out the tent,<br>
 And gained her feet in time to see him rush<br>
 In search of her&mdash;a shuddering sight to one<br>
 Loving and loved so well. But luckily,<br>
 Both then were saved. She also shared the march<br>
 That followed up the foe, action impending<br>
 At every step; and when the fight began,<br>
 Though sheltered somewhat, heard all the din,<br>
 <a name="page031"><!-- Begin Page 31 --></a> The roar of guns, and
bursting shells, and saw<br>
 The hellish fire belch forth, knowing the while<br>
 Her husband foremost in the dreadful fray.<br>
 Nay, more; her hut was all the shelter given<br>
 To dress the wounded first; so her kind eyes<br>
 Were forced to witness sights of ghastly sort,<br>
 Such as turn surgeons faint; nor she alone,<br>
 Three other ladies shared her anxious care:<br>
 But she was spared the grief they knew too soon,<br>
 Her husband being safe.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
when Burgoyne<br>
 At Saratoga lost the bloody day,<br>
 The Major came not back&mdash;a prisoner he,<br>
 And desperate wounded. After anxiety<br>
 So stringent and prolonged, it seemed too much<br>
 To hope the lady could support such sting<br>
 And depth of woe, yet drooped she not; but rose<br>
 And prayed of Burgoyne, should his plans allow,<br>
 To let her pass into the hostile camp,<br>
 There to beseech for leave to tend her husband.<br>
 Full pitifully Burgoyne granted her<br>
 The boon she asked, though loath to let her go;<br>
 For she had passed hours in the drenching rain,<br>
 Sleepless and hungry; nor had he e'en a cup<br>
 Of grateful wine to offer. He knew<br>
 Her danger, too, as she did,&mdash;that she might fall<br>
 In cruel hands; or, in the dead of night<br>
 Approaching to the lines, be fired on.<br>
 Yet yielding to her prayer, he let her go,<br>
 Giving her all he could, letters to Gates,<br>
 And for her use an open boat.<br>
 Thus she set forth, with Chaplain Brudenell<br>
 For escort, her maid, and the poor Major's man&mdash;<br>
 Thus was she rowed adown the darkling stream.<br>
 Night fell before they reached the enemy's posts,<br>
 And all in vain they raised the flag of truce,<br>
 The sentry would not even let them land,<br>
 <a name="page032"><!-- Begin Page 32 --></a> But kept them there,
all in the dark and cold,<br>
 Threatening to fire upon them if they stirred<br>
 Before the break of day. Poor lady! Sad<br>
 Were her forebodings through those darksome hours,<br>
 And wearily her soft maternal frame<br>
 Bore such great strain. But as the dark<br>
 Grows thickest ere the light appears, so she<br>
 Found better treatment when the morning broke.<br>
 With manly courtesy, proud Gates allowed<br>
 Her wifely claim, and gave her all she asked.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. Could he do less! Yes, Sergeant, I'll allow<br>
 Old times show tender women bold and brave<br>
 For those they love, and 'twill be ever so.<br>
 And yet I hold that woman braver still<br>
 Who sacrifices all she loves to serve<br>
 The public weal.</p>
<p><i>Sergeant</i>. And was there ever one?</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. Oh, yes&mdash;</p>

<br>
 Why, Laura! Now you're just too late<br>
 To have your breakfast with us. But sit down.<br>

<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. I must, no other can. The time is short,<br>
 And through the virgin woods my way doth lie,<br>
 For should those sentries meet, or all report<br>
 <a name="page034"><!-- Begin Page 34 --></a> I passed their
bounds, suspicion would be waked,<br>
 And then what hue and cry!</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. The woods! and are you crazed? You cannot go!<br>
 The woods are full of creatures wild and fierce,<br>
 And wolves prowl round about. No path is blazed,<br>
 No underbrush is cleared, no clue exists<br>
 Of any kind to guide your feet. A man<br>
 Could scarce get through, how then shall you?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. I have a Guide in Heaven. This task is
come<br>
 To me without my seeking. If no word<br>
 Reaches Fitzgibbon ere that murderous horde<br>
 Be on him, how shall he save himself?<br>
 And if defeat he meets, then farewell all<br>
 Our homes and hopes, our liberties and lives.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. Oh, dear! oh, dear! and must you risk your
life,<br>
 Your precious life? Think of it, Laura, yet:<br>
 Soldiers expect to fight; and keep strict watch<br>
 Against surprise. Think of your little girls,<br>
 Should they be left without a mother's care;<br>
 Your duty is to them, and surely not<br>
 In tasks like this. You go to risk your life.<br>
 As if you had a right, and thereby leave<br>
 Those who to you owe theirs, unpitied,<br>
 Desolate. You've suffered now enough<br>
 With all you've lost, and James a cripple, too,<br>
 What will the children do should they lose you<br>
 Just when their youthful charms require your care?<br>
 They'll blame you, Laura, when they're old enough<br>
 To judge what's right.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. I do not fear it.<br>
 Children can see the right at one quick glance,<br>
 For, unobscured by self or prejudice,<br>
 They mark the aim, and not the sacrifice<br>
 Entailed.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. Did James consent to have you go?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Not till he found there was no other
way;<br>
 He fretted much to think he could not go.</p>
<a name="page035"><!-- Begin Page 35 --></a>
<p><i>Widow</i>. I'm sure he did. A man may undergo<br>
 A forced fatigue, and take no lasting hurt,<br>
 But not a woman. And you so frail&mdash;<br>
 It is your life you risk. I sent my lads,<br>
 Expecting them to run the chance of war,<br>
 And these you go to warn do but the same.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. You see it wrong; chances of war to
those<br>
 Would murder be to these, and on my soul,<br>
 Because I knew their risk, and warned them not.<br>
 You'll think I'm right when tramp of armed men,<br>
 And rumble of the guns disturb you in your sleep.<br>
 Then, in the calmer judgment night-time brings,<br>
 You'd be the first to blame the selfish care<br>
 That left a little band of thirty men<br>
 A prey to near six hundred.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. Just the old story! Six hundred&mdash;it's
disgraceful!<br>
 Why, Were they tailors&mdash;nine to make a man&mdash;<br>
 'Tis more than two to one. Oh, you must go.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. I knew you'd say so when you came to
think:<br>
 It was your love to me that masked your judgment.<br>
 I'll go and see poor Charles, but shall not say<br>
 My real errand, 'twould excite him so.</p>

visible the driving shed: here are assembled some twenty lads of
all ages and heights, between six and sixteen. They carry all sorts
of old firelocks and are "falling in." They are properly sized, and
form a "squad with intervals." In the rear stands a mash-tub with a
sheepskin stretched over it for a drum, and near it is the

 'Tis a fine tune! A grand, inspiring tune,<br>

 "Dumble-dum-deary." Can soldiers march to that?<br>
 Can they have spirit, honour, or do great deeds<br>
 With such a tune as that to fill their ears?<br>

<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. The Sergeant's bitter on the foe, I
think.</p>
<p><i>Widow</i>. He is, but can you wonder? Hounded out<br>
 When living peaceably upon his farm.<br>
 Shot at, and threatened till he takes a side,<br>
 And then obliged to fly to save his life,<br>
 Losing all else, his land, his happy home,<br>
 His loving wife, who sank beneath the change,<br>
 Because he chose the rather to endure<br>
 A short injustice, than belie his blood<br>

<center><i>Enter</i> MRS. SECORD.&mdash;<i>After scanning the spot
searchingly, she seats herself on a fallen trunk</i>.</center>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. This spot is surely safe; here I will
rest,<br>
 For unaccustomed service tires my limbs,<br>
 And I have travelled many a weary rood<br>
 More than a crow-line measures; ups and downs<br>
 Absorb so many steps that nothing add<br>
 To distance. Faint am I, too, and thirsty.<br>
 Hist! hist! ye playful breezes that do make<br>
 Melodious symphonies and rippling runs<br>
 Among the pines and aspens, hear I not<br>
 A little tinkling rill, that somewhere hides<br>
 Its sweet beneficence 'mid ferns and moss?</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>She rises and looks about</i>.</p>
Ay, here it is: a tiny brilliancy<br>
 That glances at the light, as careful, still,<br>
 To keep the pure translucency that first<br>
 It caught from Heaven. Give me, oh give, sweet rill,<br>
 A few cool drops to slake my parching throat.<br>
 Fair emblem truly thou of those meek hearts<br>
 That thread the humblest haunts of suffering earth<br>
 With Christ-like charities, and keep their souls<br>
 Pure and untaint, by Heavenly communings.<br>

<p class="stage">[<i>She reseats herself, and contemplates the
scene</i>.</p>
<br>
 O this is beautiful! Here I could lie&mdash;<br>
 Were earth a myth and all her trials nought&mdash;<br>
 And dream soft nothings all a summer's day.<br>
 In this fair glade were surely celebrate<br>
 The nuptials of the year: and for her gift,<br>
 Fair Flora, lightly loitering on the wing<br>
 Of Zephyrus, tossed all her corbel out,<br>
 Filling the air with bloom.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From
yonder copse,<br>
 With kindling eye and hasty step, emerged<br>

with leafy honours crowned,<br>
 His following a troop of skipping lambs:<br>
 And o'er yon hill, blushing for joy, approached<br>
 His happy bride, on billowy odours borne,<br>
 And every painted wing in tendance bent.<br>
 Procession beautiful! Yet she how fair!&mdash;<br>
 The lovely Summer, in her robes of blue,<br>
 Bedecked with every flower that Flora gave,&mdash;<br>
 Sweet eglantine and meek anemone,<br>
 Bright, nodding columbine and wood-star white,<br>
 Blue violets, like her eyes, and pendant gems<br>
 Of dielytra, topaz-tipped and gold,<br>
 Fragrant arbutus, and hepatica,<br>
 With thousands more. Her wreath, a coronet<br>
 Of opening rose-buds twined with lady-fern;<br>
 And over all, her bridal-veil of white,&mdash;<br>
 Some soft diaph'nous cloudlet, that mistook<br>
 Her robes of blue for heaven.&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I
could dream<br>
 That, from his lofty throne beholding,<br>
 Great Sol, on wings of glowing eve, came down<br>
 In gracious haste, to bless the nuptials.<br>
 (<i>She pauses</i>.) And shall this land,<br>
 That breathes of poesy from every sod,<br>
 Indignant throb beneath the heavy foot<br>
 Of jeering renegade? at best a son<br>
 His mother blushes for&mdash;shall he, bold rebel<br>
 Entwine its glories in defiant wreath<br>
 Above his boastful brow, and flaunt it in<br>
 Her face, rejoicing in her woe? No! No!<br>
 This priceless gem shall ever deck her crown,<br>
 And grace its setting with a ray more pure<br>
 For that, nor flood, nor fire, can flaw its heart.<br>
 Yes, Canada, thy sons, at least, maintain<br>
 The ancient honour of their British blood,<br>
 In that their loyalty contracts no stain<br>
 From proffered gifts or gold.<br>

<h4>SCENE 3&mdash;<i>A thick wood through which runs a forest path,
leading to a high beech ridge</i>.</h4>
<center><i>Enter</i> MRS. SECORD, <i>walking as quickly as the
underbrush will allow</i>.</center>
<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. How quiet are the woods!<br>
 The choir of birds that daily ushers in<br>
 The rosy dawn with bursts of melody,<br>
 And swells the joyful train that waits upon<br>
 The footsteps of the sun, is silent now,<br>
 Dismissed to greenwood bowers. Save happy cheep<br>
 Of callow nestling, that closer snugs beneath<br>
 The soft and sheltering wing of doting love,&mdash;Like<br>
 croon of sleeping babe on mother's breast&mdash;No<br>
 sound is heard, but, peaceful, all enjoy<br>
 Their sweet siesta on the waving bough,<br>
 Fearless of ruthless wind, or gliding snake.<br>
 So peaceful lies Fitzgibbon at his post,<br>
 <a name="page042"><!-- Begin Page 42 --></a> Nor dreams of harm.
Meanwhile the foe<br>
 Glides from his hole, and threads the darkling route,<br>
 In hope to coil and crush him.<br>
 Ah, little recks he that a woman holds<br>
 The power to draw his fangs!<br>
 And yet some harm must come, some blood must flow,<br>
 In spite of all my poor endeavour.<br>
 O War, how much I hate thy wizard arts,<br>
 That, with the clash and din of brass and steel,<br>
 O'erpowers the voice of pleading reason;<br>
 And with thy lurid light, in monstrous rays<br>
 Enfolds the symmetry of human love,<br>
 Making a brother seem a phantom or a ghoul!<br>
 Before thy deadly scowl kind peace retires,<br>
 And seeks the upper skies.<br>
 O, cruel are the hearts that cry "War!" "War!"<br>
 As if War were an angel, not a fiend;<br>
 His gilded chariot, a triumphal car,<br>
 And not a Juggernauth whose wheels drop gore;<br>
 His offerings, flowers and fruit, and chaplets gay,<br>
 And not shrieks, tears, and groans of babes and women.<br>
 And yet hath War, like Juggernauth, a hold,<br>
 A fascination, for humanity,<br>
 That makes his vot'ries martyrs for his sake.<br>
 Even I, poor weakling, march in keeping-time<br>
 To that grand music that I heard to-day,<br>
 Though children played it, and I darkly feel<br>
 Its burden is resistance physical.<br>
 'Tis strange that simple tones should move one so!<br>
 What is it, what, this sound, this air, this breath<br>
 The wind can blow away,<br>
 Nor most intricate fetters can enchain?<br>
 What component of being doth it touch<br>
 That it can raise the soul to ecstasy,<br>
 Or plunge it in the lowest depth of horror?<br>
 Freeze the stopt blood, or send it flowing on<br>
 In pleasant waves?<br>
 <a name="page043"><!-- Begin Page 43 --></a> Can draw soft tears,
or concentrate them hard<br>
 To form a base whereon the martyr stands<br>
 To take his leap to Heaven?<br>
 What is this sound that, in Niagara's roar<br>
 Brings us to Sinai;<br>
 Or in the infant's prayer to Him, "Our Father?"<br>
 That by a small inflection wakes the world,<br>
 And sends its squadroned armies on<br>
 To victory or death;<br>
 Or bids it, peaceful, rest, and grow, and build?<br>
 That reassures the frighted babe; or starts<br>
 The calm philosopher, without a word?<br>
 That, in the song of little bird speaks glee;<br>
 Or in a groan strikes mortal agony?<br>
 That, in the wind, brings us to shipwreck, death.<br>
 And dark despair;<br>
 Or paints us blessed islands far from care or pain?<br>
 Then what is sound?<br>
 The chord it vibrates with its magic touch<br>
 Is not a sense to man peculiar,<br>
 An independent string formed by that breath<br>
 That, breathed into the image corporate,<br>
 Made man a living soul.<br>
 No, for all animate nature owns<br>
 Its sovereign power. Brutes, birds, fish, reptiles, all<br>
 That breathe, are awed or won by means of sound.<br>
 Therefore, it must be of the corporate, corporeal<br>
 And, if so, <i>why then the body lives again</i>,<br>
 Despite what sceptics say; for sound it is<br>
 Will summon us before that final bar<br>
 To give account of deeds done in the flesh.<br>
 The spirit cannot thus be summoned,<br>
 Since entity it hath not sound can strike.<br>
 Let sceptics rave! I see no difficulty<br>
 That He, who from primordial atoms formed<br>
 A human frame, can from the dust awake it<br>
 Once again, marshal the scattered molecules<br>
 <a name="page044"><!-- Begin Page 44 --></a> And make immortal, as
was Adam.<br>
 This body lives! Or else no deep delight<br>
 Of quiring angels harping golden strings;<br>
 No voice of Him who calls His children home;<br>
 No glorious joining in the immortal song<br>
 Could touch our being<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
how refined our state!<br>
 How changed! Never to tire or grow distraught,<br>
 Or wish for rest, or sleep, or quietude,<br>
 But find in absence of these earthly needs<br>
 A truer Heaven.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O
might I rest even now!<br>
 These feet grow painful, and the shadows tell<br>

<h3>ACT III</h3>
<h4 class="scene">SCENE 1.&mdash;<i>Decau's house, a stone edifice
of some pretensions. The parlour, with folding doors which now
stand a little apart. A sentry is visible, on the other side of
them. The parlour windows are barricaded within, but are set open,
and a branch of a climbing rose with flowers upon it, swings in.
The sun is setting, and gilds the arms that are piled in one corner
of the room. A sword in its scabbard lies across the table, near
which, in an arm-chair, reclines</i> Lieutenant Fitzgibbon, <i>a
tall man of fine presence; in his right hand, which rests
negligently on the back of the chair, he holds a newspaper of four
pages, "The Times," from which he has been reading. Several elderly
weather-beaten non-commissioned officers and privates, belonging to
the 49th, 104th, and 8th regiments, together with a few militiamen
and two cadets share the society of their superior officer, and all
are very much at their ease both in appointments and manner, belts
and stocks are unloosed, and some of the men are smoking</i>.</h4>
<p><i>Lieut. Fitzgibbon</i>. 'Tis true, it seems, and yet most
horrible;<br>
 More than five hundred thousand fighting men<br>
 Crossed with him o'er the front, and not a tenth<br>
 Remains. Rather than let him find a place<br>
 For winter quarters, two hundred thousand<br>
 Happy families had to forsake their homes<br>
 In dead of winter, and of the ancient seat<br>
 Of Russian splendour, Rotopschin made a pyre,<br>
 A blazing pyre of all its precious things:<br>
 Moscow is burned.</p>
<p><i>First Sergeant</i>. So Boney could but toast his freezing
toes<br>
 And march back home again: Fine glory that!</p>
<p><i>Fitzgibbon</i>. Sad waste of precious lives for one man's
will.<br>
 But this mishap will seal his fate. The Czar<br>
 Will see his interest is a strong alliance,<br>
 And all the Powers will prove too great a match,<br>
 Even for Buonaparte.</p>
<p><i>Second Sergeant</i>. Where is he now, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><i>Fitzgibbon</i>. In Paris, plotting again, I see; or was<br>
 Nine weeks ago.</p>
<p><i>First Private</i>. Yon news coom quick.<br>
 <a name="page051"><!-- Begin Page 51 --></a> Now when I were a
bairn, that's forty year sin',<br>
 We heard i' York 'at Merriky refused<br>
 To pay the taxes, just three munth's arter;<br>
 An' that wur bonnie toime, fur then t'coa&auml;ch<br>
 Tuk but foive da&auml;ies ti mak' t' hull waai' doon,<br>
 Two hunner moile, fra Lunnon.</p>
<p><i>Fitzgibbon (still scanning the newspaper)</i>.<br>
 Well, Jimmy, here's a man, one Bell,<br>
 Of Greenock, can send a boat by steam<br>
 Against the wind and tide, and talks with hope<br>
 Of making speed equal to both.<br>
 He's tried it on the Clyde, so we may look<br>
 For news from England in a month, ere long.</p>
<p><i>First Private</i>. Na, na, sir; noo doant 'e pooak fun at
me!<br>
 Iver he doos ma' I go hang. Why neist<br>
 They scatterbrain 'ull mayhap send a shep<br>
 Jest whear tha' loike wi'oot a win' at all.<br>
 Or promise till 't. 'Twere pity Nelson, noo,<br>
 He'd noan o' sech at Copenh&aacute;agen<br>
 Mebbe tha' cu'd ha' gott tha' grunded sheps<br>
 Afloat, an gett moor men to fe'ht them D&aacute;ans.</p>
<p><i>Fitzgibbon</i>. The fewer men the greater glory, Jim.<br>
 Why, man, he got his title by that fight.</p>
<p><i>Second Sergeant</i>. And well deserved it! A finer man<br>
 Never trod deck, sailor or officer;<br>
 His voice gave courage, as his eye flashed fire.<br>
 We would have died for him, and he for us;<br>
 And when the fight was done he got our rights,<br>
 Or tried at it. More than old Parker did.</p>
<p><i>First Sergeant</i>. Parker was rich, and so forgot the
poor,<br>
 But Nelson forgot none.</p>
<p><i>Second Private</i>. He was cliver, too. Dash't! how I
laughed,<br>
 All i' my sleeve o' course. The fight was hot,<br>
 And getting hotter, for, gad, them Danes can fight!<br>
 And quite a quarter o' the ships was stuck,<br>
 The Admiral's among 'em. So Nelson held<br>
 The squadron at command. Up comes the word,<br>
 <a name="page052"><!-- Begin Page 52 --></a> "The signal
Thirty-nine is out, sir." Nelson turns,<br>
 His stump a-goin' as his arm was used<br>
 Afore he lost it, meets the officer, as says,<br>
 "Sir, Thirty-nine is out, shall I repeat it?"<br>
 "No, sir; acknowledge it." Then on he goes.<br>
 Presently he calls out, "What's flying now?"<br>
 "The same, sir." So he takes his glass<br>
 And puts it to his eye, his blind eye, mind you,<br>
 An' says he, "No signal can I see. No,<br>
 Ne'er a one." Winking to Ferguson, says he,<br>
 "I've but one eye, and may be blind sometimes.<br>
 What! strike off now and lose the day? Not so:<br>
 My signal keep for 'Closer battle,' flying.<br>
 That's how I'll answer. Confound the signal!<br>
 Nail mine to the mast." He won.</p>
<p><i>First Militiaman</i>. Just touch and go for hanging,
that.</p>
<p><i>Fitzgibbon</i>. Success ne'er saw a scaffold, Jeremy.</p>
<p><i>A Cadet</i>. Fine-looking fellow Nelson-was, I guess?</p>
<p><i>First Sergeant</i>. To look at? No, a little, thin, pale
man<br>
 With a long queue, one arm, and but one eye,<br>
 But that a blazer!</p>
<p><i>Second Militiaman</i>. These little uns has lots o'
spunk:<br>
 Boney's a little un, I've heerd.</p>
<p><i>First Private</i>. Just so: and Wellington ain't big.</p>
<p><i>Fitzgibbon (rising and drawing himself to his full
height)</i>.<br>
 Come, boys, you're getting personal. See me!<br>
 If none but little men may win renown,<br>
 I hope I'm two in one, for your sakes.<br>
 And you forget the lion-hearted Brock.</p>
<p><i>All</i> (<i>interrupting him</i>). No! no! no!</p>
<p><i>Fitzgibbon</i>. A man of height exceeding any here,<br>
 And yet whose alt of metred inches<br>
 Nobly enlarged to full, fair, Saxon mould,<br>
 And vested in the blazonments of rule,<br>
 Shewed not so kingly to the obeisant sight<br>
 As was his soul. Who than ye better knew<br>
 His bravery; his lofty heroism;<br>
 <a name="page053"><!-- Begin Page 53 --></a> His purity, and great
unselfish heart?<br>
 Nature in him betrayed no niggard touch<br>
 Of corporate or ethereal. Yet I yield<br>
 That men of lesser mould in outward form<br>
 Have been as great in deeds of rich renown.<br>
 But then, I take it, greatness lies not in<br>
 The flesh, but in the spirit. He is great<br>
 Who from the quick occasion of the time<br>
 Strikes out a name. And he is also great<br>
 Who, in a life-long struggle, throws the foe,<br>
 And binds on hoary locks the laurel crown.<br>
 Each is a high exemplar.<br>
 One with concentrate vigour strikes a blow<br>
 That rings around the world; the other draws<br>
 The world round him&mdash;his mighty throes<br>
 And well-contested standpoints win its praise<br>
 And force its verdict, though bleak indifference&mdash;<br>
 A laggard umpire&mdash;long neglect his post,<br>
 And often leaves the wrestler's best unnoted,<br>
 Coming but just in time to mark his thews<br>
 And training, and so decides: while the loud shock<br>
 Of unexpected prowess starts him aghast,<br>
 And from his careless hand snatches the proud award.<br>
 But mark me, men, he who is ever great<br>
 Has greatness made his aim&mdash;<br>
 The sudden blow or long-protracted strife<br>
 Yields not its secret to the untrained hand.<br>
 True, one may cast his statue at a heat,<br>
 But yet the mould was there;<br>
 And he who chips the marble, bit by bit,<br>
 Into a noble form, sees all the while<br>
 His image in the block.<br>
 There are who make a phantom of their aim&mdash;<br>
 See it now here, now there, in this, in that,<br>
 But never in the line of simple duty;<br>
 Such will accomplish nothing but their shame:<br>
 For greatness never leaves that thin, straight mark;<br>
 <a name="page054"><!-- Begin Page 54 --></a> And, just as the
pursuit diverges from it,<br>
 Greatness evanishes, and notoriety<br>
 Misleads the suitor. I'd have you think of this.</p>

 Above the brows of Queenston Heights where we impatient lay;<br>
 Niagara fretted at our feet, as chafing at his post,<br>

host.<br>

 Down, down, they press us, inch by inch, beyond the village

 Our darling leader, noble Brock&mdash;hark to his gallant cry!<br>

 "Follow me, boys!" the hero cries. We double to the
wall&mdash;<br>
 Waving his gleaming sword on high, he climbs, and follow all;<br>

 All heedless of the leaden hail that whistles from each tree:<br>
<br>
 For on and up proud Victory lures&mdash;we touch her laurel
crown&mdash;<br>
 When by malign, deliberate aim the hero's stricken down.<br>
 He falls! We fire, but ah, too late&mdash;the murderous work is
done.<br>
 No more that voice shall cheer us on, with "Vict'ry!" in its
tone.<br>

 He falls: nor word nor look may cheer young Jarvis' anxious
quest;<br>
 Among his stricken men he sinks, his hand but seeks his
breast.<br>
 O, Death, could none but him suffice thy cold, insatiate eye?<br>
 Nor knewed'st thou how many there for him would gladly die!<br>
<br>
 Nor lonely speeds the parting soul, nor lonely stands the
bier&mdash;<br>
 Two forms the bastion-tomb enfolds, two claim the soldier's
tear.<br>

<p><i>Mrs. Secord</i>. Sir, I have walked the whole way through the
woods,<br>
 <a name="page059"><!-- Begin Page 59 --></a> For fear of spies,
braving all other foes.<br>
 Nor, since at early morn I left St. David's Mill,<br>
 Until I met your sentry on the ridge,&mdash;<br>
 Who begged me tell you so, and said "all's well,"&mdash;<br>
 Spoke I, or saw, a soul. Since then, the chief,<br>
 Whose senior sent him with me for a guide,<br>
 Has been my kind protector to your post.</p>
<p><i>Fitzgibbon (to the chief</i>). I thank you, Mishe-mo-qua, and
your chief.</p>
<p>(<i>To Mrs. Secord, bowing</i>.) But you, oh; madam, how shall I
thank you?<br>
 You have, indeed, performed a woman's part,<br>
 A gentle deed; yet at expense of more<br>
 Than woman's fitting means. I am not schooled<br>
 In courtly phrases, yet may I undertake<br>
 To thank you heartily, not on our part<br>
 Alone, but in our good King George's name,<br>
 For act so kind achieved. Knew he your care<br>
 For his brave men&mdash;I speak for those around&mdash;<br>
 Of whom some fought for him at Copenhagen,<br>
 He would convey his thanks, and the Queen's, too&mdash;<br>
 Who loves all nobleness&mdash;in better terms<br>
 Than I, his humble servant. Affliction<br>
 Leaves him in our hands to do him justice;<br>
 And justice 'tis, alike to him and you,<br>
 To thank you in his name, and in the Regent's.</p>

 Nor shrink lest gentler tones should lack<br>

<br>
 For many a valiant deed is done,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And great achievement wrought,<br>
 Whose inspiration knows no source<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Save pure and holy thought.<br>
<br>
 Nor think some lofty pedestal,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Proud-lifted towards the skies,<br>
 The only plane where Worth can wrest<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; From Fame her highest prize:<br>
<br>
 For many a nameless nook and lone,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And many a tongueless hour,<br>
 Sees deeds performed whose glories shame<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The pride of pomp and power.<br>
<br>
 Nor dream that to a noble deed<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It needs a noble name;<br>
 Or that to mighty act achieved<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Must link a stalwart frame:<br>
<br>
 For strung by Duty's steady hand,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And thrilled by Love's warm touch,<br>
 Slight forms and simple names may serve<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; At need, to avail for much.<br>

 O heard ye not of Queenston Heights,&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of Brock who fighting fell,&mdash;<br>
 And of the Forty-ninth and York,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Who 'venged their hero well?&mdash;<br>
<br>
 And of the gallant stand they made&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; What prowess kept at bay<br>
 The swelling foe, till Sheaffe appeared,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And won the glorious day!<br>
<br>
 Yet heard ye how&mdash;ban of success&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Irresolution ruled,<br>
 Till all our green peninsula<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And border-land, were schooled<br>
<br>
 To bear, nathless all frowningly,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The yoke of alien power,<br>
 And wait in patience, as they might,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The dawn of happier hour.<br>
<br>
 Till Forty-mile, and Stony Creek,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Revived our waning hopes,<br>
 And round Fort-George a limit held<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Yankees as with ropes.<br>
<br>
 Yet, as do cordons oft enclose<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The unwilling with the fain,<br>
 Our people, by forced parole held,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Could naught but own the rein.<br>
<br>
 Then heard ye how a little post.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Some twenty miles away,<br>
 A check upon proud Dearborn's hopes,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Was fixed upon for prey?<br>
<br>
 <a name="page071"><!-- Begin Page 71 --></a> And how lest
Britain's bull-dog pluck,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Roused by their isolation,<br>
 Should make these few, brave, lonely men,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Fight as in desperation,<br>
<br>
 And prove a match for thrice their odds,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; They made them three times three,<br>
 And thrice of that, with guns to boot,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; To insure a victory?<br>
<br>
 Then they would take the Night along<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;No mean ally with odds,<br>
 As Stony Creek can testify:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; But then she marched with gods!&mdash;<br>
<br>
 Yet blame ye not the silent Night<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That she was forced to go,<br>
 For oft have captives been compelled<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; To serve the hated foe:<br>
<br>
 And oft with grave and quiet mien,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And Samson-like intent,<br>
 Have brought about such ends, as by<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Their lords were never meant.<br>

plain, 'tis not to thee<br>

 'Tis rather me; and I will go,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Safe in the care of Heaven."<br>
<br>
 "Thou go, dear wife! a woman soft,<br>

 Scarce had Aurora backward drawn<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The curtains of the night,<br>
 Scarce had her choristers awaked<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The echoes with delight;<br>
<br>
 When Laura Secord left her home,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; With holy message fraught,<br>
 And lone Fitzgibbon's distant post<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; With hasty footsteps sought.<br>
<br>
 She chides the harsh-tongued sentinel<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose musket stops her way,<br>
 And hies her from his curious sight<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In such sort as she may.<br>
<br>
 A second bars her forward path,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Nor will he be content;<br>
 And all her woman's wit she needs<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Before his doubts are spent.<br>
<br>
 Beyond, a third the challenge gives;&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; She almost gasps for breath&mdash;<br>
 "Oh, at the Mill my brother lies<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the point of death."<br>
<br>
 <a name="page074"><!-- Begin Page 74 --></a> But he nor cares for
death nor life:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Yet when she kneels and weeps,<br>
 He yields: for&mdash;in his rugged heart<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A tender memory sleeps.<br>
<br>
 With beating heart and trembling limb,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Swift hastes she; yet in ruth<br>
 That even for her country's sake,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; She needs must veil the truth.<br>
<br>
 And when a rise of ground permits<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A last, fond, lingering look,<br>
 She, tearful, views her home once more&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A lowly, leafy nook.<br>
<br>
 For there her sleeping children lie<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Unconscious of her woe;<br>
 Her choking sobs may not be stayed,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; For oh, she loves them so!<br>
<br>
 And there she leaves her maiden choice,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband, lover, friend.<br>
 Oh, were she woman could she less<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; To homely sorrows lend!<br>
<br>
 On altar of the public weal<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Must private griefs expire,&mdash;<br>
 Her tender grief exhaled to Heaven<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; On wings of patriot fire.<br>
<br>
 The dew still glistened on the grass,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The morning breezes swung<br>
 The honeysuckle and the rose,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Above, whose sweetness hung.<br>
<br>
 The fritil' butterfly, the bee,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose early labours cheer,<br>
 And point the happy industry<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That marks the opening year.<br>
<br>
 <a name="page075"><!-- Begin Page 75 --></a> The cheerful robin's
sturdy note,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The gay canary's trill,<br>
 Blent with the low of new-milked kine<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That sauntered by the rill:<br>
<br>
 When Laura Secord stood beside<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The doomed St. David's door,<br>
 Whose portals never closed upon<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The weary or the poor.<br>
<br>
 "O sister," cries the widowed dame,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "What trouble brings you here?<br>
 Doth Jamie ail? Hath aught arisen<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; To mar your fettered cheer?"<br>
<br>
 "Nor aileth any at the farm,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is our cheer less free,<br>
 But I must haste to Beaver Dam,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Fitzgibbon there to see.<br>
<br>
 "For many a foe this coming night,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; To take him by surprise,<br>
 Is detailed, and he must be warned<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Before the moon doth rise."<br>
<br>
 O pallid grew the gentle dame,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And tremulous her tone,<br>
 As Laura Secord, at the board,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Made all her errand known.<br>
<br>
 And oft her pallor turned to red,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; By indignation fired;<br>
 And oft her red to pallor turned,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; For Laura's sake retired.<br>
<br>
 And many a cogent argument<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; She used, of duteous wives;<br>
 And many more that mothers thus<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Should never risk their lives.<br>
<br>
 <a name="page076"><!-- Begin Page 76 --></a> And of the dangers of
the way<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; She told a trembling tale;<br>
 But to divert a settled mind<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Nor words nor woes avail.<br>
<br>
 And many a tear she let down fall,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And some dropt Laura too,&mdash;<br>
 But "'Tis my country!" yet she cried,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "My country may not rue."<br>
<br>
 A tender leave she gently takes<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of him all wounded laid<br>
 Upon his weary couch of pain,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; But hides her errand sad.<br>
<br>
 And then, while yet the day was young,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The sun scarce quarter high,<br>
 She plunges 'mid the sheltering bush,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In fear of hue and cry,&mdash;<br>
<br>
 Of hue and cry of cruel foes<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Who yet might learn her route,<br>
 And mad with rage of baffled aim,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Should spring in hot pursuit.<br>
<br>
 On, on she speeds through bush and brake,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; O'er log and stone and briar;<br>
 On, on, for many a lengthening mile<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Might stouter footsteps tire.<br>
<br>
 The hot sun mounts the upper skies,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Faint grows the fervid air,<br>
 And wearied nature asks for rest<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mid scenes so soft and fair.<br>
<br>
 The sward all decked with rainbow hues,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The whispering of the trees,<br>
 Nor perfumed airs of flowery June,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Can win her to her ease.<br>
<br>
 <a name="page077"><!-- Begin Page 77 --></a> Ah, serpent in our
Paradise!<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In choicest cup our gall!<br>
 'Twas thou, distraught Anxiety,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Wrapped Beauty's self in pall;<br>
<br>
 And for that lonely traveller<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Empoisoned those sweet springs,<br>
 To souls that languish, founts of life<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Bestirred by angel wings.<br>
<br>
 Thou gavest each breeze an infant's cry,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A wailing, woesome tone;<br>
 And in each call of wildwood bird<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Spoke still of freedom gone.<br>
<br>
 Nay now, why starts she in her path,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; By yonder tangled brake?<br>
 'Tis at the dreaded menace sprung<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; By angry rattlesnake.<br>
<br>
 But know that fear is not the brand<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That marks the coward slave;<br>
 'Tis conquered fear, and duty done,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That tells the truly brave.<br>
<br>
 With stick, and stone, and weapon mean<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; She drives the wretch away,<br>
 And then, with fluttering heart, pursues<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Her solitary way.<br>
<br>
 And oft she trips, and oft she falls,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And oft her gown is torn,<br>
 And oft her tender skin is pierced<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; By many a clutching thorn.<br>
<br>
 And weariness her courage tries;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And dread of devious way;<br>
 And oft she hears the wild-cat shriek<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A requiem o'er its prey.<br>
<br>
 <a name="page078"><!-- Begin Page 78 --></a> And when the
oppressive summer air<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Hangs heavy in the woods,&mdash;<br>
 Though many a bank of flowerets fair<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Invites to restful moods;<br>
<br>
 And though the ruby humming-bird<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Drones with the humming bee;<br>
 And every gnat and butterfly<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Soars slow and fitfully;<br>
<br>
 No rest that anxious messenger<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of baleful tidings takes,<br>
 But all the waning afternoon<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Her morning speed she makes.<br>
<br>
 Over the hills, and 'mongst the brier,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And through the oozy swamp,<br>
 Her weary steps must never tire<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Ere burns the firefly's lamp.<br>
<br>
 Oh, wherefore drops she on her knees,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And spreads imploring hands?<br>
 Why blanches that courageous brow?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! the wolves' dread bands!<br>
<br>
 "Nay, not this death, dear Father! Not<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A mangled prey to these!"<br>
 She faintly cries to Heaven, from out<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The darkening waste of trees.<br>
<br>
 Fear not, O patriot, courage take,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Thy Father holds thy hand,<br>
 Nor lets the powers of ill prevail<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Where He doth take command.<br>
<br>
 Away the prowling ghouls are fled,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Some fitter prey to seek;<br>
 The trembling woman sighs the thanks<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Her white lips cannot speak.<br>
<br>

<br>
 Now wherefore halts that sentry bold,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And lays his piece in rest,<br>
 As from the shadowy depths below<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; One gains the beechen crest?<br>
<br>
 'Tis but a woman, pale and faint,&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; As woman oft may prove,<br>
 Whose eagle spirit soars beyond<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The home-flight of the dove.<br>
<br>
 How changes now the sentry's mien,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; How soft his tones and low,<br>
 As Laura Secord tells her tale<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of an impendent foe!<br>
<br>
 "God bless thee, now, thou woman bold,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And give thee great reward."<br>
 The soldier says, with eyes suffused,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And keeps a jealous guard,<br>
<br>
 As onward, onward still she goes,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; With steady step and true,<br>
 Towards her goal, yet far away,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Hid in the horizon blue.<br>
<br>
 Behind her grows the golden moon,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Before her fall the shades,<br>
 And somewhere near her hides the bird<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose death-call haunts the glades.<br>
<br>
 The early dew blooms all the sod,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The fences undulate<br>
 In the weird light, like living lines<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That swell with boding hate.<br>
<br>
 For she has left the tangled woods,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And keeps the open plain<br>
 Where once a fruitful farm-land bloomed,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And yet shall bloom again.<br>
<br>
 <a name="page080"><!-- Begin Page 80 --></a> And now, as nears the
dreaded hour.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Her goal the nearer grows,<br>
 And hope, the stimulus of life,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Her weary bosom glows.<br>
<br>
 Toward's lone Decamp's&mdash;whose ancient home<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Affords Fitzgibbon's band<br>
 Such shelter as the soldier asks<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose life hangs on his brand&mdash;<br>
<br>
 A steady mile or so, and then&mdash;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, what is't rends the air<br>
 With horrent, blood-encurdling tones.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The tocsin of despair!<br>
<br>
 It is the war-whoop of the braves,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of Kerr's famed Mohawk crew,<br>
 Who near Fitzgibbon ambushed lie<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; To serve that lonely few.<br>
<br>
 Startled, yet fearless, on she speeds.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "Your chief denote," she cries;<br>
 And, proudly towering o'er the crowd,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The chief does swift arise.<br>
<br>
 Fierce rage is in his savage eye,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; His tomahawk in air;<br>
 "Woman! what woman want?" he cries,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "Her death does woman dare!"<br>
<br>
 But quickly springs she to his side,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And firmly holds his arm,<br>
 "Oh, chief, indeed no, spy am I,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; But friend to spare you harm."<br>
<br>
 And soon she makes her errand known,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And soon, all side by side,<br>
 The red man and his sister brave<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In silence quickly glide.<br>
<br>
 <a name="page081"><!-- Begin Page 81 --></a> And as the moon
surmounts the trees,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; They gain the sentried door,<br>
 And faintly to Fitzgibbon she<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfolds her tale once more.<br>
<br>
 Then, all her errand done, she seeks<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A lowly dwelling near,<br>
 And sinks, a worn-out trembling thing,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Too faint to shed a tear.<br>
<br>
<br>

<center>V.</center>
<br>
 Now let the Lord of Hosts be praised!<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Cheer brave Fitzgibbon's band,<br>
 Whose bold discretion won the day,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And saved our threatened land!<br>
<br>
 And cheer that weary traveller,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; On lowly couch that lies,<br>
 And scarce can break the heavy spell.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That holds her waking eyes.<br>
<br>
 No chaplet wreathes her aching brows.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; No paeans rend the air;<br>
 But in her breast a jewel glows<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The tried and true may wear.<br>
<br>
 And Time shall twine her wreath of bays<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Immortal as her fame,<br>
 And many a generation joy,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In Laura Secord's name.<br>
<br>
 "Fitzgibbon and the Forty-ninth!"<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Whene'er ye drink that toast<br>
 To brave deeds done a grateful land,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Praise Laura Secord most.<br>
<br>
 As one who from the charged mine<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Coils back the lighted fuse,<br>
 'T was hers, at many a fearful risk,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; To carry fateful news;<br>
<br>
 <a name="page082"><!-- Begin Page 82 --></a> And save the
dreadnought band; and give<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; To Beaver Dam a name,<br>
 The pride of true Canadian hearts,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of others, but the shame.<br>
<br>

<center>VI.</center>
<br>
 Now wherefore trembles still the string<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; By lyric fingers crossed,<br>
 To Laura Secord's praise and fame,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; When forty years are lost?<br>
<br>
 Nay, five and forty, one by one,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Have borne her from the day<br>
 When, fired by patriotic zeal,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; She trod her lonely way:<br>
<br>
 Her hair is white, her step is slow,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Why kindles then her eye,<br>
 And rings her voice with music sweet<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of many a year gone by?<br>
<br>
 O know ye not proud Canada,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; With joyful heart, enfolds<br>
 In fond embrace, the royal boy<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose line her fealty holds?<br>
<br>
 For him she spreads her choicest cheer,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And tells her happiest tale,<br>
 And leads him to her loveliest haunts,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That naught to please may fail.<br>
<br>
 And great art thou, O Chippewa,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Though small in neighbours' eyes,<br>
 When out Niagara's haze thou seest<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A cavalcade arise;<br>
<br>
 And, in its midst, the royal boy,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Who, smiling, comes to see<br>
 An ancient dame whose ancient fame<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Shines in our history.<br>
<br>
 <a name="page083"><!-- Begin Page 83 --></a> He takes the thin and
faded hand,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; He seats him at her side,<br>
 Of all that gay and noble band,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; That moment well the pride:<br>
<br>
 To him the aged Secord tells,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; With many a fervid glow,<br>
 How, by her means, Fitzgibbon struck<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; His great historic blow.<br>
<br>
 Nor deem it ye, as many do,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A weak and idle thing<br>
 That, at that moment Laura loved<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The praises of a king;<br>
<br>
 And dwelt on his approving smile,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; And kissed his royal hand,<br>
 Who represented, and should wield,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The sceptre of our land;<br>
<br>
 For where should greatness fire her torch,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; If not at greatness' shrine?<br>
 And whence should approbation come<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Did not the gods incline?<br>
<br>
<br>

<center>VII.</center>
<br>
 And when, from o'er the parting seas,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A royal letter came,<br>
 And brought a gift to recognize<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brave Laura Secord's fame.<br>
<br>
 What wonder that her kindling eye<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Should fade, suffused in tears?<br>
 What wonder that her heart should glow,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Oblivious of the years?<br>
<br>
 And honour ye the kindly grace<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of him who still hath been<br>
 In all things kindly, and the praise<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of our beloved Queen.<br></td></tr></table>

 O thou, the root and flower of this our joy,<br>
 Well may thy praise our grateful hearts employ!<br>
 Fair as the moon and glorious as the sun,<br>
 Thy fame to many a future age shall run.<br>

 "I WILL BE GOOD." 'Twas thus thy judgment spake,<br>
 When, greatness would allure for greatness' sake.<br>
 Thou <i>hast</i> been good: herein thy strength hath lain;<br>
 And not thine only, it hath been our gain:<br>
 Nor ours alone, for every people's voice,<br>
 Because thou hast been good, doth now rejoice.<br>
 Beneath the shelter of that fruitful vine&mdash;<br>
 Thy goodness&mdash;hath pure Virtue reared her shrine.<br>
 Freedom hath lift her flag, and flung it free,<br>
 Rejoicing in a god-like liberty.<br>
 Truth hath her gracious lineaments revealed<br>
 To humble souls, beneath Victoria's shield.<br>
 Mercy, whose message bore thy first command,<br>
 Hath carried festival to every land.<br>
 Justice hath worn his robes unsmirched of gold;<br>
 Nor longer strikes in vengeance, as of old.<br>
 Kind Pity, wheresoe'er the tried might be,<br>
 Widow, and babe, hath borne a balm from thee.<br>
 Valour hath drawn his sword with surer aim:<br>
 And Peace hath signed her treaties in thy name.<br>

 And Piety pursued her readier race.<br>
 Learning hath pressed where ne'er she walked before:<br>
 And Science touched on realms undreamt of yore.<br>
 Commerce hath spread wide wings o'er land and sea,<br>
 And spoken nations glorious yet to be.<br>
 Before the light of Temperance' purer grace.<br>
 Excess hath veiled his spoiled and purpled face.<br>
 And never since the peopled world began<br>
 Saw it so strong the brotherhood of man.<br>
 Great glory thus hath gathered round thy name,&mdash;<br>
 VICTORIA. QUEEN. Goodness hath been thy fame,<br>
 And greatness shall be, for the twain are one:<br>
 As thy clear eye discerned ere rule begun.<br>

 His unswerving eye he fixes on the child;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And straight o'er floe and fissure,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fragments yielding to his pressure,<br>
 Toppling berg, and giddy block, he takes his way;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes climbing, sometimes
crawling.<br>

turning.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyes cast down, and bosoms burning,<br>
 Gain the shelter of their quiet barrack home;<br>

 The fears, the hopes, that tear the parents breasts!<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the mess, so sadly broken,<br>
 Of the men who mourn their comrade brave and true<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And many a tear-drop glistens,<br>

 To the tumult of the ice along the shore.<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children hold each other dearer,<br>
 In the gaps of slumber broken by its roar.<br>

 Came the news of rescue, safety, glad return;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mother, as from Heaven,<br>

 And the father wrung the hand of Sergeant Neill:<br>

 But straight returned to duty and his post.<br>

 Musketry rattled; shouts, cries, groans, were heard;<br>
 Men met as foes, and deadly strife ensued.<br>
 From side to side the surging combat rolled,<br>

 Flies flaunting in the wind, mocking the gun.<br>
 Dark forms pour o'er the heights, and Britain's day<br>
 Broods dark.<br>
 But hark! a ringing cheer peals up the height<br>
 Once more the battle's tide bursts on my view.<br>
 Brock to the rescue! Down goes the alien flag!<br>
 Back, back the dark battalions fall. On, on<br>
 The "Tigers" come. Down pours the rattling shot<br>
 From out the verdant grove, like sheets of hail.<br>

 Spake rashly. But calm Reflection<br>
 Laid her cool hand upon my throbbing brow<br>

 THE HAULING DOWN OF THE STATE FLAG FROM OVER THE CITY

in from every direction and filled the street in a compact mass
both above and below the square. They were silent, but angry and
threatening. An open way was left in front of the hall, and their
force being stationed, Captain Bell and Lieutenant Kantz passed
across the street, mounted the hall steps and entered the Mayor's
parlour. Approaching the Mayor, Captain Bell said: "I have come in
obedience to orders to haul down the State flag from this
building." ... As soon as the two officers left the room Mr. Monroe
also went out. Descending the front steps he walked out into the
street, and placed himself immediately in front of the howitzer
pointing down St. Charles Street. There, folding his arms, he fixed
his eyes upon the gunner who stood, lanyard in hand, ready for
action. Here he remained without once looking up or moving, until
the flag had been hauled down by Lieutenant Kantz, and he and
Captain Bell reappeared.... As they passed out through the Camp
Street gate, Mr. Monroe turned towards the hall, and the people,
who had hitherto preserved the silence he had asked from them,
broke into cheers for their Mayor."</p>

<h3><a name="lost">LOST WITH HIS BOAT.</a></h3>
<hr>
<table align="center" summary="poem positioner">
<tr>
<td>Alone&mdash;alone! I sit, and make my moan.<br>
 The fire burns low, the candle flickers dim.<br>
 Alone&mdash;alone! I rock, and think of him.<br>
 Of him who left me in the purple pride<br>
 Of early manhood. <i>Yestermorn</i> he went.<br>
 The sun shone bright, and scintillant the tide.<br>
 O'er which the sea-mew swept, with dewy drops besprent.<br>
 Before he went he kissed me; and I watched<br>
 His boat that lay so still and stately, till<br>
 Automaton she seemed, and that she moved<br>
 To where she willed of her own force and law.<br>
 But I knew better: <i>his</i> was the will<br>
 That set the pretty sprite a-going.<br>
 His arms controlled her to obedience:<br>
 Those arms that lately clasped me.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No
alarms<br>
 Chilled my fond heart, nor dimmed my vision.<br>
 As I saw the fair white messenger move off<br>
 On fleecy puffs of cloud into the blue;<br>
 My nearest thought to trim my hearth, and make,<br>
 A dainty dish would please my darling's taste<br>
 On his return. And all day long, and through<br>
 The dreamy summer day, my thoughts were full<br>
 Of many a gay return; my ears reheard<br>
 The cheery word and joke were wont to mark them.<br>
 Nor when the sun went down in wrack and mist&mdash;<br>
 A mist that gathers who knows how or where?&mdash;<br>
 Feared I of aught. My little hearth burned bright.<br>
 The kettle sang, and pussy purred and napped;<br>
 And&mdash;rocking to and fro, as I do now,<br>
 I hummed a little song; one <i>he</i>, had sung<br>
 In other days, and with the manly tones<br>
 <a name="page108"><!-- Begin Page 108 --></a> Had stolen my heart
away.<br>
 The hearth burned low; I ate my meal alone,<br>
 And something like a fear I chased away,<br>
 Despite the deepening surges of the wind<br>
 That scurried round our cot.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
slept: and waked<br>
 What time the summer storm, that rose and fell<br>
 In sullen gusts, flew by; and slept again,<br>
 And dreamed a glad return. When morning broke<br>
 A glorious day begun. The storm was gone:<br>
 The sparkling waves toyed with the lilting breeze;<br>
 The merry sun shone bright; and all the blue<br>
 Was decked with tiny flecks of feathery white.<br>
 A gladsome morn! But I, I missed my love.<br>
<br>
 <i>And now they say he's dead</i>. Lost, with his boat,<br>
 In that short summer storm of yesternight.<br>
 Lost! <i>lost</i>! my love is lost! No more may I<br>
 Welcome his step, hear his glad voice, and kiss<br>
 His laughing lips. I may not even clasp<br>
 His cold dead form in one long, last embrace!<br>
 And here I sit alone.&mdash;<br>
 I drove them all away, their words but maddened me.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone
I sit,<br>
 And rock, and think,&mdash;I cannot weep&mdash;<br>
 And conjure up the depths, those cruel depths<br>
 That chafe and fret, and roll him to and fro<br>
 Like a stray log:&mdash;he, whose dear limbs should lie<br>
 Peaceful and soft, in rev'rent care bestowed.&mdash;<br>
 Or in the sunken boat, gulfed at his work,<br>
 I see his blackened corse, even in death<br>
 Faithful to duty. O that those waves,<br>
 That with their gentle lullaby mock my wild woe,<br>
 Would rise in all their might and 'whelm me too!<br>
 Oh, love!&mdash;oh, love!&mdash;my love!<br></td></tr></table>

 MAY, 1874.</a></h3>

<tr>
<td>O blessed angel of the All-bounteous King,<br>
 Where dost thou stay so long? Our sad hearts pine,<br>
 Our spirits faint, for thee. Our weary eyes<br>
 Scan all the blue expanse, where not a cloud<br>
 Floats low to rest our vision. In vain we turn<br>
 Or East or West, no vap'rous haze, nor view<br>
 Of distant panorama, wins our souls<br>
 To other worlds. All, all is hard and scant.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy
brother Spring is come.<br>
 His favourite haunts the sheltering woods betray&mdash;<br>
 The woods that, dark and cheerless yet, call thee.<br>
 Tender hepaticas peep forth, and mottled leaves<br>
 Of yellow dog's tooth vie with curly fronds<br>
 Of feathery fern, in strewing o'er his path;<br>
 The dielytra puts her necklace on,<br>
 Of pearly pendants, topaz-tipped or rose.<br>
 Gray buds are on the orchard trees, and grass<br>
 Grows up in single blades and braves the sun.<br>
 But thou!&mdash;O, where art thou, sweet early Rain,<br>
 That with thy free libations fill'st our cup?<br>
 The contemplative blue-bird pipes his note<br>
 From off the ridge cap, but can find no spot<br>
 Fit for his nest. The red-breast on the fence<br>
 Explores the pasture with his piercing eye,<br>
 And visits oft the bushes by the stream,<br>
 But takes no mate. For why? No leaves or tuft<br>
 Are there to hide a home. Oh what is earth<br>
 Without a home? On the dry garden bed,<br>
 <a name="page111"><!-- Begin Page 111 --></a> The
sparrow&mdash;the little immigrant bird&mdash;<br>
 Hops quick, and looks askance,<br>
 And pecks, and chirps, asking for kindly crumbs&mdash;<br>
 Just two or three to feed his little mate:<br>
 Then, on return from some small cunning nook<br>
 Where he has hidden her, he mounts the wires,<br>
 Or garden fence, and sings a happy song<br>
 Of home, and other days. A-missing thee<br>
 The husbandman goes forth with faltering step<br>
 And dull sad eye; his sweltering team pulls hard<br>
 The lab'ring plough, but the dry earth falls back<br>
 As dead, and gives nor fragrant fume, nor clogs<br>
 The plough-boy's feet with rich encumb'ring mould.<br>
 The willows have a little tender green.<br>
 And swallows cross the creek&mdash;the gurgling creek<br>
 Now fallen to pools&mdash;but, disappointed,<br>
 Dart away so swift, and fly so high<br>
 We scarce can follow them. Thus all the land<br>
 Doth mourn for thee.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah!
here thou comest&mdash;sweet Rain.<br>
 Soft, tender Rain! benison of the skies!<br>
 See now, what transformation in thy touch!<br>
 Straight all the land is green. The blossoming trees<br>
 Put on their bridal wreaths, and veil their charms<br>
 From the too ardent sun, beneath thy gift<br>
 Of soft diaphanous tissue, pure and white<br>
 As angel's raiment. Little wood children<br>
 Deck all the path with flowers. The teeming earth<br>
 Offers rich gifts. The little choristers<br>
 Sing ceaseless hymns, and the glad husbandman<br>
 Adds his diapason. Bright fountains wake<br>
 And mingle with the swift roulade of streams.<br>
 The earth is full of music! Thou dost swing<br>
 Thy fragrant censer high, and dwellers in<br>
 The dusty city raise their toil-worn heads<br>
 From desk and bench, and cry "Summer is here!"<br>
 <a name="page112"><!-- Begin Page 112 --></a> And straight they
smell new hay and clover blooms;<br>
 And see the trout swift-darting in the brooks:<br>
 And hear the plover whistling in the fields.<br>
 And little children dream of daisy chains;<br>
 And pent-up youth thinks of a holiday;<br>
 A holiday with romps, and cream, and flowers.<br>
 O, Rain! O, soft, sweet Rain! O liberal Rain!<br>
 Touch our hard hearts, that we may more become<br>
 Like that Great Heart, whose almoner art
thou.<br></td></tr></table>

<td>Why now, sweet Alice, though thy numbers ring<br>
 Like silver bells, methinks their burden wrong.<br>
 For if 'tis right, then were the hermits right,<br>
 And all recluses. And He was wrong<br>
 Who gave to Adam, Eve: and leaned upon<br>
 The breast of John the loved. So was He wrong<br>
 To love the gentle home at Bethany.<br>
 The sisters, and their brother Lazarus.<br>
 So was He wrong to weep at Lazarus' grave,<br>
 Pity's hot tears for Sin, and Death, and Woe.<br>
 And in that awful hour when manhood failed<br>
 And God forsook, He still was wrong to think<br>
 With tenderest solicitude and care<br>
 Upon his mother, and leave her in the charge<br>
 Of John. And He was wrong who gave us hearts<br>
 To yearn, and sensibilities to meet<br>
 Those "clinging tendrils" thou wouldst have us cut.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou art right, sweet
Alice,<br>
 There were no ties of infancy, or age;<br>
 Of consanguinity: or noble bond<br>
 Of wide humanity, or sacred home:<br>
 For without love,&mdash;e'en our poor earthly love,&mdash;<br>
 The world were dead.<br>
 Love is the silver cord, that, being loosed,<br>
 The fabric of humanity falls wide<br>
 In hopeless wrack. Well for us it is<br>
 That when our nature, hurt, falls, shrieking, down,<br>
 The Great Physician's hand may raise it up<br>
 <a name="page114"><!-- Begin Page 114 --></a> And bind the wound.
But what mad folly 'twere<br>
 Did we, like peevish child, beat down the hand,<br>
 And tear afresh the wound. And this we do<br>
 When of our morbid selves we idols make,<br>
 And cry "No sorrow like to mine."<br>
 O rather should we turn our tenderer hearts&mdash;<br>
 Made gentler by our griefs&mdash;to gentle cares<br>
 For weak Humanity, and, knowing what woe<br>
 Our sinful nature brings upon itself,<br>
 With God-like pity love it but the more.<br></td></tr></table>

 The crass ingratitude of haughty man,<br>
 Vested in all the pride of place and power,<br>
 Brooks not the aspirations of my sex,<br>

 Lest from his laurelled brow the wreath should fall<br>

<p><i>Mr. Bloggs</i>. Why, what's the matter, Kate?</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>. Not much, papa, only I am refused<br>
 Admission to the college. <i>Sapient</i> says<br>
 The Council have considered my request,<br>
 And find it inconsistent with the rules<br>
 Of discipline and order to admit<br>
 Women within their walls.</p>
<a name="page123"><!-- Begin Page 123 --></a>
<p><i>Mr. B</i>. I thought they'd say so. Now be satisfied;<br>
 You've studied hard. Have made your mark upon<br>
 The honour list. Have passed your second year.<br>
 Let that suffice. You know enough to wed,<br>
 And Gilmour there would give his very head<br>
 To have you. Get married, Kate.</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>. Papa, you vex me; Gilmour has no chance<br>
 And that I'll let him know. Nor have I spent<br>
 My youth in studious sort to give up now.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Bloggs</i>. What will you do? They will not let you
in,<br>
 For fear you'd turn the heads of all the boys.<br>
 And quite right, too. I wouldn't have the care<br>
 And worry of a lot of lively girls<br>
 For all I'm worth.</p>
<p class="stage">[<i>He kisses her</i>.</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>. P'raps not, papa. But yet I mean to have<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I

<p><i>Kate</i>. Oh, it was just this letter, mamma, from Mr.
Sapient, telling me that the Council won't let me go to University
College to share the education that can only be had there at a
reasonable cost, because the young men would be demoralized by my
presence.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Bloggs</i>. Kate, I am astonished at you! Have I not
always said that women do not need so much education as men, and
ought to keep themselves <i>to</i> themselves, and not put
themselves forward like impudent minxes? What'll men think of you
if you go sittin' down on the same benches at the colleges, and
studyin' off of the same desk, and, like enough&mdash;for there are
girls bold enough for that&mdash;out of the same books? And what
must the professors think women are comin' to when they want to
learn mathyphysics and metamatics and classical history, and such
stuff as unfits a woman for her place, and makes her as ignorant of
household work, managin' servants, bringin' up children, and such
like, as the greenhorns that some people take from the emigrant
sheds, though I wouldn't be bothered with such ignoramuses,
spoilin' the knives, and burnin' the bread, for anythin'?</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>. Now, mamma, you know we have gone all over this
before, and shall never agree, because I think that the better
educated a woman is, the better she can fulfil her home duties,
especially in the care and management of the health of her family,
and the proper training of her sons and daughters as good
citizens.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Bloggs</i>. You put me out of all patience, Kate! For
goodness' sake get married and be done with it. And that reminds me
that Harry Gilmour wants you to go to the picnic with him on
Dominion Day, and to the concert at the Gardens at night; and he
said you had snubbed him so at Mrs. Gale's that he didn't like to
speak about it to you without I thought he might. Now, that's what
I call a real shame, the way you do treat that young man. A risin'
young lawyer as he is, with no end of lots in Winnipeg, and all the
money his father made for him up there; comes of a good old family,
and has the best connections; as may be a member yet, perhaps
senator some day, and you <a name="page125">
<!-- Begin Page 125 --></a> treat him as if he was quite beneath
you. I do hope you'll just show a little common sense and accept
his invitations.</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>. Well, mamma, I think the real shame, as you call
it, is that you, and other ladies, will allow your daughters to go,
about to picnics, parties, balls, theatres or anywhere else, with
any man who happens to ask them, and without even so much as a
girl-companion, and yet you see nothing but impropriety in my
desire to attend college, where all the opportunity of associating
with the other sex is limited to a few lectures delivered by grave
and reverend Professors, under conditions of strict discipline, and
at which the whole attention of the students must necessarily be
concentrated on the subject. As for unlimited opportunities for
flirting, there are none; and the necessities of college life
compel each student to attend to his duties while within the halls,
and then go home; wherever that may be.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Bloggs</i>. It's no use talking, Kate, you won't alter
my opinion. If they'd build another college specially for ladies,
as I hear the Council is willin' to do, and put it under charge of
a lady who would look after the girls, I wouldn't object so much,
though, as I always say, I don't see the need of so much learnin'
for women.</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>. Well, mamma, how much would be gained by a separate
building? The Council, it is true, offer a piece of ground, within
a few minutes walk of the college, for a ladies' college, and
promise to deliver lectures specially "altered to suit the female
capacity." But if there was an intention of giddiness and
flirtation on the part of the lady students, how much hindrance do
you think the separate college would be? And if we can't understand
the same lectures as our brothers, it is evident we can't
understand the same books. Rather a hard nut to crack, isn't
it?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Bloggs</i>. How rude you are, Kate! I am ashamed of
you.</p>

 Shrink from the sun; and welcome fearsome night!<br>
 A deed will chase my trembling steps by ways<br>

 Will make me tremble if a child observes<br>
 Me close; and quake, if, in a public crowd,<br>
 One glances at me twice!<br>
 A deed I'll blush for, yet I'll do't; and charge<br>
 Its ugliness on those who forced me to't&mdash;<br>
 In short, I'll wear the breeks.</p>
<p><i>Orphea</i>. Oh, Katie! You?</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>. Yes, me, dear coz.</p>
<p><i>Orphea</i>. But then your hair, and voice!</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>. I'll train my voice to mouth out short, thick
words,<br>
 As Bosh! Trash! Fudge! Rot! And I'll cultivate<br>
 An Abernethian, self-assertive style,<br>
 That men may think there is a deal more in<br>
 My solid head than e'er comes out.<br>
 My hair I'll cut short off.</p>

 And shall Macaulay's proud New Zealander<br>

 Thinks I'm an awful girl.<br>
 If she but knew&mdash;<br>
 Yet might I plead that men and women oft<br>

<center>MISS ORPHEA BLAGGS <i>solus, reading a letter</i>.</center>
<p><i>Orphea (reading)</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>"My Dearest Orphea&mdash;Congratulate me! me, your cousin, Tom
Christopher, M.A., Gold Medallist.&mdash;Mathematics, and also
Natural Sciences; Honours in Classics, and Prizeman in German
again. You cannot think how queer I feel with all my blushing
honours thick upon me, and more to come. Tuesday! my dear Orphea,
Tuesday! Only think of it, Master of Arts, or more correctly
Mistress of Arts! Now let the New Zealanders boast, and the
Cambridge girls bite their tongues, Canada has caught them up! Ah,
my dear Orphea, that is the drop of gall in the cup of your
successful cousin&mdash;the Canterbury Antipodeans got their
honours <i>first</i>. It reminds me of the saying that the nearer
to church the farther from heaven, since it is evidently the nearer
to the centre of civilization the farther from a University Degree,
so far as we unfortunate women are concerned. But never mind! I've
proved that Canadian girls are equal in mental power with Canadian
boys, and I am only impatient to let the Dons know it.</p>
<p>"And now, my love, for the conclusion of the two years' farce.
It has cost me a whole week's sleep to sketch a plan by which to
declare my sex in the most becoming manner to my fellow
students.</p>
<p>"Do you know, dear, when I look back upon the pleasures of the
past two years&mdash;how soon we forget the pain!&mdash;I am not
inclined to regret the step rendered necessary by my devotion to my
sex, for use has made me quite at home in
the&mdash;ah&mdash;divided skirt! How many lovely girls have I
danced with through the rosy hours who will never more smile on me
as they were wont to smile! How many flowers of rhetoric have been
wasted on me by the irony of fate! How many <i>billets-doux</i>, so
perfumed and <a name="page132"><!-- Begin Page 132 --></a> pretty,
lie in my desk addressed to my nether garment! And how many mammas
have encouraged Mr. Christopher, who will forever taboo Miss
Bloggs! And then the parties and the picnics! Ah, my dear Orphea,
what do I not sacrifice on the altar of my sex. But a truce to
regrets.</p>
<p>"I am longing to see the elegant costume in which I shall appear
before the astonished eyes of the multitude as Miss Bloggs,
M.A.</p>
<p>"You know my style, the latest out, which I find by the fashion
books is Mignonette trimmed with Chinese Pheasant. Buttons up the
back of the sleeves, with rubies and amethysts. Let the fichu be
Eidelweiss; trim the fan and slippers with the same, and use
dandelions and calla lilies for the bouquets. Not a button less
than forty on the gloves, and don't forget my hair.</p>
<p>"Get yourself up to match by contrast, and come and help me make
a sensation.</p>
<p>"The dinner is on the <i>tapis</i>. Webb will be caterer, Sells
will supply the cider; Shapter and Jeffery the Zoedone, and I have
entered into a contract with the Toronto Water Works for pure water
on this occasion only. I have bought up every flower in Toronto, so
that if the tariff does not prevent it, other folks will have to
import their own roses; and I have engaged every boy in the public
schools who has nothing better to do next Saturday to go to Lome
Park and bring back as many maiden-hairs as he can find. Ferns are
my craze, as you know, and I am quite a crank on maiden-hair, which
I mean to adopt for my crest with "If she will, she will," as a
motto. Ever your own,</p>

of whom is</i> Miss Blaggs. <i>The cloth is drawn, and dessert is

<p><i>Mr. Biggs, B.A. (Tor. Univer.), on his feet</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">Ah&mdash;ladies and gentlemen, here's
to our host,<br>
 And rising, as thus, to propose him a toast,<br>

 In shade, and in sunshine, as chums we have passed,<br>
 In love, and esteem, that forever must last,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Let happen what will to the weather.</p>
<p>In short, ladies and gentlemen, I have to propose the
everlasting health and welfare of our host, who should have been
our honoured guest but for that persistent pertinacity he exhibited
in the matter, and which he does himself the injustice to call
womanish. But I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, no one but himself
ever accused our esteemed host of being womanish, and when we look
upon the high standing he has achieved in our University, the
honour he confers on his Alma Mater by his scholarly attainments
and the gentlemanly character he has won among all sorts of
students, I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, we should be doing great
injustice to you all were we for one moment to admit that he could
be other than he is, an honour to Toronto University, and a credit
to his sex. I am quite sure the ladies are at this moment envying
the happy woman whom he will at no distant date probably
distinguish with his regard, and it must be satisfactory to
ourselves, gentlemen, to know that it lies in our power, as the
incumbents of academic honours, to be able to bestow that reversion
of them on those who, having all the world at their feet, need not
sigh for the fugitive conquests that demand unceasing toil and an
unlimited amount of gas or coal-oil. Ladies and gentlemen, I call
<a name="page134"><!-- Begin Page 134 --></a> upon you to fill your
sparkling glasses to the honour of our host and college chum, Mr.
Tom Christopher. And here's with a hip, hip, hooray! and hands all

 But yet I know, and knowing it am proud,<br>
 That most men here to-night would welcome all<br>
 The sweet girl-graduates that would fill the list<br>
 Did but the College Council set aside<br>
 A foolish prejudice, and let them in.<br>
 And now, I know a girl who long has worked<br>
 To pass the exams, take the proud degree<br>
 I hold to-day, and yet her petticoat<br>

 Oust self-possession, for my friend's a girl<br>

 Pray Heaven you'll not look worse when you know all.<br>
 I am indeed a girl, though you have known<br>
 Me hitherto as Thomas Christopher.<br>
 Four years ago I passed the exams, for<br>
 Us women, at your University.<br>
 Once more I passed. But when again I would,<br>
 I stumbled for the teaching that is chained&mdash;<br>
 Like ancient scripture to the reading desk&mdash;<br>
 Within your College walls. No word of mine<br>
 Could move the flinty heads of College Council.<br>
 <a name="page136"><!-- Begin Page 136 --></a> Order and discipline
forbade, they said,<br>
 That women should sit-side by side with men<br>
 Within their walls. At church, or concert, or<br>
 At theatre, or ball, no separation's made<br>
 Of sexes. And so I, being a girl<br>
 Of firm and independent mind, resolved<br>
 To do as many a one beside has done<br>
 For lesser prize, and, as a man, sat at<br>
 The feet of our Gamaliels until I got<br>
 The learning that I love. That I may now<br>
 Look you all in the face without a blush, save&mdash;that<br>
 Which naturally comes at having thus<br>
 To avow my hardihood, is praise, I trow,<br>
 You will not think unworthy; and to me<br>
 It forms a soft remembrance that will ever dwell<br>
 Within my grateful heart.<br>
 Can you forgive me?</p>
<p><i>Many Voices</i>.&mdash;We do, we must. All honour to the
brave!<br>
 Speak for us, Biggs.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Biggs</i>.&mdash;I cannot speak, except to ask the lady's
pardon<br>
 For our rough ways.</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>.&mdash;No; pardon me.</p>
<p><i>Many Voices</i>.&mdash;No! no! we ask your pardon.</p>
<p><i>Kate</i>.&mdash;If that, indeed, as I must need believe<br>
 From all your looks, you do not blame me much,<br>
 Endue me with a favour. It is this:&mdash;<br>
 Let every man and woman here to-night<br>
 Look out for those petitions that will soon<br>
 Be placed in many a store by those our friends<br>
 Who in this city form a ladies' club,<br>
 And each one sign. Nay more, to show you mean<br>
 What I, with swelling heart have often heard<br>
 You strongly urge, the rights of women to<br>
 The College privileges, get all your friends<br>
 To sign. Do what your judgment charges you<br>
 To help so good a cause, and let the lists<br>
 Of 1883 have no more names<br>
 <a name="page137"><!-- Begin Page 137 --></a> Set by themselves as
women. Let us go<br>
 In numbrous strength before the Parliament,<br>
 And ask our rights in such a stirring sort,<br>
 They shall be yielded. Then I shall know<br>
 Your brotherly and pleasant words mean faith,<br>
 And shall no more regret a daring act<br>
 That else will fail of reason.<br>
 May I thus trust?</p>

 To-day his daily song, nor joined the crowd<br>
 In envious exultation. To him spoke<br>
 Another of his kind. "Vain one, refrain<br>
 That everlasting pipe, fit for a cage<br>
 Behind some cotter's lattice, where thy gray<br>
 And thickset form may shun the cultured eye.<br>
 A word of warning, too&mdash;hide from the Prince."<br>
 "Dear brother," cried the gray, "be not annoyed;<br>
 Who sees your elegance of form, and depth<br>
 Of perfect colour, ne'er will notice me."<br>
 The morrow came,&mdash;the Prince. Each bird essayed<br>
 To please the royal taste, and many a meed<br>
 Of praise was won and given&mdash;this for his hue;&mdash;<br>
 That for his elegance;&mdash;another for<br>
 <a name="page142"><!-- Begin Page 142 --></a> His fascinating
grace. Yet something lacked,<br>
 'Twas evident, and many an anxious glance<br>
 Betrayed the latent fear.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yon
little bird<br>
 In quiet gray and green courts not my praise,<br>
 Yet should a singer be," exclaimed the Prince,<br>
 As with a critical and searching eye<br>
 He scanned the small competitors for choice.<br>
 Obedient to his governor, the bird<br>
 Poured forth his song, oblivious of the crowd<br>
 Of vain and envious round him, in whose eyes<br>
 He stood contemptible. The Prince, entranced,<br>
 Broke forth at length: "Nor hue, nor elegance,<br>
 Nor fascination, can outvie the gift<br>
 Of genius. My choice is made."<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to
the great offence<br>
 Of one bright bird, at least, the humble gray<br>
 Became the royal treasure.<br></td></tr></table>

 Truth fled the earth; and men were fain to grope<br>
 In utter darkness. Blindly they blundered,<br>
 And were long distraught, till on the horizon rose<br>
 A luminosity, and in its midst<br>
 A form. They cried, "'Tis Truth! fair Truth returned!'<br>

 To that of other days, they worshipped it,<br>
 And all things went along much as at first.<br>
 Until, born none knew whence, a doubt arose;<br>
 Grew strong; and spake; and pondering, men began<br>
 To quest their goddess' claim. Then, too, was set<br>
 A secret watch, a covert test for proof;<br>
 And one fine day there rose a clamour, such<br>
 As cheated mobs will make, when cunning puts<br>
 A veto on their claim.<br>
 For this mob found that, in her stolen guise<br>
 Of softer beams, they had adored a cheat;<br>
 A make-believe; a lie.<br>
 Immense their rage! One aim inspired them all&mdash;<br>
 To punish. But while they swayed and tossed<br>
 In wrathful argument on just desert,<br>
 Fair Truth indeed appeared, clad in her robes<br>
 Of glorious majesty. "Desist, my friends,"<br>
 She cried; "the executioner condign<br>
 Of Insincerity, and your avenger,<br>
 Is Time, my faithful henchman."<br></td></tr></table>

 All sheltered from the boisterous gale,<br>
 Had passed his days in soft repose;<br>
 The other from the cliff arose,<br>
 And bore the brunt of stormy wind<br>
 That lashed him oft in frenzy blind.<br>
<br>
 A day there happed when from the north<br>
 Aquilon drave his forces forth,<br>
 And hurled them headlong on the rock<br>
 Where, proudly poised to meet the shock,<br>
 Our bold tree stood. In gallant might,<br>
 He took the gage of proffered fight,<br>
 And though in every fibre wrung,<br>
 Kept every fibre still upstrung.<br>

 "Thou tremblest!" cried the sheltered tree,<br>
 "Thine own the folly! Come to me.<br>

 Scarce may it bend our haughty brows&mdash;<br>
 Scarce may a breeze our branches kiss&mdash;<br>
 From every harm a shelter this."<br>

 He bowed and straightened, writhed and shook,<br>

 A tightening clutch with grip of steel,<br>
 Nor once the storm-fiend made him reel;<br>
 And when his weary foe passed by,<br>
 Still towered he proudly to the sky.<br>
<br>
 Then through the vale the wing&egrave;d blast<br>
 For the first time in fury passed,<br>
 As through ripe grain the sickles go,<br>
 Widespread he scattered fear and woe;<br>
 Prone fell the tree&mdash;so safe before&mdash;<br>
 'Mid ruin dire, to rise no more.<br>

 With stern adversity aright.<br>

<tr>
<td>In ancient days the Caliph Almamon<br>
 A palace built in Bagdad, fairer far<br>
 Than was the vaunted house of Solomon.<br>
 The portico a hundred columns graced<br>
 Of purest alabaster. Gold and blue<br>
 And jasper formed the rich mosaic floor.<br>
 Ceiled with the fragrant cedar, suites of rooms<br>
 Displayed a wealth of sculpture; treasures rare<br>
 In art and nature vied; fair flowers and gems,<br>
 Perfumes and scented myrtles; verdure soft<br>
 And piercing lustre; past the embroidered couch<br>
 The gushing fountains rolled on dancing wave.<br>
 And beauty reigned o'er all.<br>
 Near this abode, but just beyond the gate,<br>
 A simple cottage stood, old and dilapidate,<br>
 The home of a poor weaver. There, content<br>
 With little gain procured by labour long,<br>
 Without a debt and thus beyond a care,<br>
 The old man lived, forgotten perhaps, but free.<br>
 His days all peaceful softly wore away<br>
 And he nor envied was, nor envying.<br>
 As hath been told, his small and mean retreat,<br>
 Just masked the palace gates. The Grand Vizier<br>
 Would pull it down, without formality<br>
 Of law, or word of grace. More just his lord<br>
 Commands to buy it first. To hear is to obey;<br>
 They seek the weaver's bearing bags of gold;<br>
 "These shalt thou have."<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No;
keep your lordly sum,<br>
 My workshop yields my needs," responds the man,<br>
 "And for my house, I have no wish to sell;<br>
 Here was I born, and here my father died:<br>
 <a name="page148"><!-- Begin Page 148 --></a> And here would I die
too. The Caliph may,<br>
 Should he so will, force me to leave the place<br>
 And pull my cottage down, but should he so<br>
 Each day would find me seated on the stone<br>
 The last that's left, weeping my misery.<br>
 I know Almamon's heart; 'twill pity me."<br>
 This bold reply the Vizier's choler raised;<br>
 He would the rascal punish, and at once<br>
 Pull down the sorry hut. Not so the Caliph:<br>
 "No; while it stands my glory lives," saith he,<br>
 "My treasure shall be taxed to make it whole;<br>
 And of my reign it shall be monument;<br>
 For when my heirs shall this fair palace mark<br>
 They shall exclaim 'How great was Almamon!'<br>
 And when yon cottage 'Almamon was just!'"

 Gathers his harvest, or his garden tends.<br>
 Here sweet domestic joys together shared<br>
 Crown every evening, whether 'neath the trees<br>
 The smiling summer draws the table forth:<br>
 Or round the cosy hearth the winter cold<br>
 With crackling faggot blazing makes their cheer.<br>
 Here do the careful parents ever give<br>
 Counsels of virtuous knowledge to their sons.<br>
 The father with a story points his speech,<br>
 The mother with a kiss.<br>
 Of different tastes, the boys: the elder one,<br>
 Grave, studious, reads and thinks the livelong day;<br>
 The younger, sprightly, gay, and graceful, too,<br>
 Leaps, laughs incessant, and in games delights.<br>
 One evening, as their wont, at father's side,<br>

 The elder Rollin read. The younger played:<br>
 Small care had he for Rome's ambitious deeds,<br>
 Or Parthian prowess; his whole mind was set<br>
 To build a house of cards, his wit sharp-drawn<br>
 To fit the corners neatly. He, nor speaks,<br>
 Nor scarce may breathe, so great his anxious care.<br>

 Strikes the frail tenement, and so destroys<br>

<h3><a name="trans3">THE LEGEND OF THE EARTH.
<br>FROM THE FRENCH OF JEAN RAMEAU.</a></h3>

<tr>
<td>When the Creator had laid out the deeps,<br>
 The great illimitable fields of sad-eyed space,<br>
 A weighty bag upon His neck He threw,<br>
 Whence issued sound confused of huddled stars;<br>
<br>
 And, plunging in the sack His mighty hand,<br>
 He traversed all the ether's wondrous plain<br>
 With slow and measured step, as doth a sower,<br>
 Sowing the gloomy void with many suns.<br>
<br>
 He tossed them&mdash;tossed them&mdash;some in fantastic
groups,<br>
 And some in luminous; some terrible.<br>
 And 'neath the Sower's steps, whose grain was stars,<br>
 The furrows of the sky, ecstatic, smoked.<br>
<br>
 He tossed them&mdash;tossed them&mdash;out of His whirling
hand,<br>
 Plenteous in every place, by full broad casts<br>
 Measured to rhythmic beat; and golden stars<br>
 Flew o'er the wide expanse like firefly swarms.<br>
<br>
 "Away! away!" cried He of worlds the Sower:<br>
 "Away, ye stars! spring in the wastes of heaven;<br>
 Broider its purple fields with your fair gems;<br>
 Tuneful, elated, gladsome, take your course.<br>
<br>
 "Go, wave of fire, into a darksome night,<br>
 And there make joy, and there the pleasant day!<br>
 And launch into the depths immeasurable<br>
 Quick, quivering darts of glowing light and love!<br>
<br>
 <a name="page165"><!-- Begin Page 165 --></a> "I will that all
within your bounds shall shine,<br>
 Be glad, be prosperous, happy, blest, content,<br>
 Shall sing for ever 'Glory be to Thee,<br>
 Creator, Father, Sower, who with suns<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast
filled infinity!'"<br>
<br>
 Thus He dismissed the stars, weighted with life,<br>
 Careering round their calm Creator's feet<br>
 As, in a desert place July has scorched,<br>
 The grains of sand may cloud the traveller's steps.<br>
<br>
 And glittered all, and sang; and, hindered not,<br>
 Upon their axes turned, constant and sure;<br>
 Their million million voices, strong and deep,<br>
 Bursting in great hosannas to the skies.<br>
<br>
 And all was happiness and right, beauty and strength;<br>
 And every star heard all her radiant sons<br>
 With songs of love ensphere her mother-breast;<br>
 And all blessed Life. And blessed the Highest Heaven.<br>

<hr>
Now, when His bag of stars he had deplete,<br>
 When all the dark with orbs of fire was strown,<br>
 The Sower found at bottom, 'twixt two folds,<br>
 A little bit of shining sun, chipped off.<br>
<br>
 And wondering, knowing not what sphere unknown<br>
 Revolved in crimson space all incomplete,<br>
 The great Creator, at a puff, spun off<br>
 This tiny bit of sun far into space;<br>
<br>
 Then, mounting high up to His scarlet throne,<br>
 Beyond the mist of thickly scattered worlds,<br>
 Like a great crowned king whose proud eye burns<br>
 At hearing from afar His people's voice,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
listens,<br>
 <a name="page166"><!-- Begin Page 166 --></a><br>
 And He hears<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
mighty Alleluia of the stars,<br>
 The choirs of glowing spheres in whirling flood<br>
 Of song and high apotheosis,<br>
 All surging to His feet in incense clouds.<br>
<br>
 He sees eternity with rapture thrilled;<br>
 He sees in one prolonged diapason<br>
 The organ of the universe, vehement, roll<br>
 For ever songs of praise to Him, the Sower.<br>
<br>
 But suddenly He pales. From starry seas<br>
 A smothered cry mounts to the upper skies;<br>
 It rises, swells, grows strong; prevailing o'er<br>
 All the ovation of the joyful spheres.<br>
<br>
 From that dim atom of the chipped orb<br>
 It comes; from wretches left forsaken, sad,<br>
 Who weep the Mother-star, incessant sought<br>
 And never found from that gray point of sky.<br>
<br>
 And the cry said "Cursed! Cursed are we, the lost<br>
 By misery led, a wretched pallid flock,<br>
 Made for the light and tossed into the dark!<br>
<br>
 "We are the banished ones; the exile band;<br>
 The only race whose eyes are filled with tears.<br>
 And if the waters of our seas be salt,<br>
 'Twas our forefathers tears that made them so.<br>
<br>
 "Be He Anathema, the Sower of Light!<br>
 Be He Anathema whom worlds adore!&mdash;<br>
 If to our native star He join us not<br>
 Be He accursed, through all creation cursed, for aye!"<br>
<br>
 Then rose the God from His great scarlet throne,<br>
 And gentle, moved, weeping as we, He stretched<br>
 His two bright arms over the flat expanse,<br>
 And in a voice of thunder launched reply:&mdash;<br>
<br>
 <a name="page167"><!-- Begin Page 167 --></a> "Morsel of Sun,
calling thyself the Earth:&mdash;<br>
 Chrysalides on her grey bounds supine:&mdash;<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe

<h3>LAURA SECORD, THE HEROINE OF 1812<br>
 A DRAMA.</h3>
<h4>NOTE 1, <a href="#page011">page 11</a>.</h4>
<p>The simple heroic story thus enlarged into dramatic form is not
unknown to the Canadian muse, but has been sung by several of her
votaries, notably by Miss Machar, of Kingston; Mr. John Reade, of
Montreal; and Dr. Jakeway, of Stayner.</p>
<p>Dr. Jakeway's verse is not so well known as it deserves to be,
not only for its literary merit, but also for its patriotic
fervour, the fervour of a true and loyal Canadian: I shall
therefore be pardoned if I quote the closing stanzas of his "Laura
Secord":</p>

<center>And Stony Creek was ours.</center>
<p>A 49th man thus writes to Auchinleck, p.
178:&mdash;"Sir,&mdash;To your, account of the battle of Stony
Creek I would like to add a few particulars.... At eleven o'clock
at night the Light Company and Grenadiers of the 49th were under
arms; every flint was taken out and every charge was drawn. Shortly
after we moved on in sections, left in front, the Light Company
leading the way towards the enemy's camp. I had been driven in that
afternoon from Stony Creek, and was well acquainted with the
ground. The cautious silence observed was most painful; not a
whisper was permitted; even our <a name="page176">
<!-- Begin Page 176 --></a> footsteps were not allowed to be heard.
I shall never forget the agony caused to the senses by the
stealthiness with which we proceeded to the midnight slaughter. I
was not aware that any other force accompanied us than the
Grenadiers, and when we approached near the Creek, I ventured to
whisper to Col. Harvey, 'We are close to the enemy's camp, sir.'
'Hush! I know it,' was his reply. Shortly after a sentry challenged
sharply; Lieutenant Danford and the leading section rushed forward
and killed him with their bayonets; his bleeding corpse was cast
aside, and we moved on with breathless caution. A second
challenge&mdash;who comes there?&mdash;another rush and the poor
sentinel is transfixed, but his agonized dying groans alarmed a
third who stood near the watch fire; he challenged, and immediately
fired and fled. We all rushed forward upon the sleeping guard; few
escaped; many awoke in another world. The excitement now became
intense; the few who had escaped fired as they ran and aroused the
sleeping army. All fled precipitately beyond the Creek, leaving
their blankets and knapsacks behind.</p>
<p>"Our troops deployed into line and halted in the midst of the
camp fires, and immediately began to replace their flints. This,
though not a <i>very</i> lengthy operation, was one of intense
anxiety, for the enemy now opened a most terrific fire, and many a
brave fellow was laid low. We could only see the flash of the
enemy's firelocks while we were perfectly visible to them, standing
as we did in the midst of their camp fires. It was a grand and
beautiful sight. No one who has not witnessed a night engagement
can form any idea of the awful sublimity of the scene. The first
volley from the enemy, coming from a spot as 'dark as Erebus,'
seemed like the bursting forth of a volcano. Then again all was
dark and still, save the moans of the wounded, the confused click!
click!&mdash;noise made by our men in adjusting their flints, and
the ring of the enemy's ramrods in reloading. Again the flash and
roar of the musketry, the whistling of the bullets, and the crash
of the cannon. 'Chaos has come again.' The anxious moments (hours
in imagination) have passed; the trembling excited hands of our men
have at last fastened their flints; the comparatively merry sound
of the ramrod tells that the charge is driven home; soon the fire
is returned with animation; the sky is illumined with continued
flashes; after a sharp contest and some changes of position, our
men advance in a body and the enemy's troops retire. There were
many mistakes made in this action, the two greatest were removing
the men's flints, and halting in the midst of the camp fires; this
is the reason why the loss of the enemy was less than ours, their
wounds were mostly made by our bayonets. The changes of position by
different portions of each army in the dark accounts for the fact
of prisoners having been made by both parties. I must give the
enemy's troops great credit for having recovered from their
confusion, and for having shown a bold front so very soon after
their having been so suddenly and completely surprised.</p>

<center>Friend Penn.</center>
<p>Of this character, of whom the writer has made a somewhat free
use, Col. Coffin says: "There is a tradition in the neighbourhood
that Harvey himself having borrowed the garb and waggon of a
Quaker"&mdash;of which sect there were many settled in Upper Canada
at the time&mdash;"penetrated into the American lines, selling
potatoes and 'taking notes.' Those who can recall the commanding
stature and bearing of the gallant officer maintain that this was
the very last disguise in which he was likely to succeed. It is not
impossible that some patriotic 'Friend' really found a good market
for his produce and valuable information for Harvey."</p>

<center>Pete and Flos.</center>
<p>That the rights of the slave-holder had legal recognition in
1812 is not to be doubted, and that nearly every family of any
means or repute held slaves is certain. The Bill abolishing slavery
in the British Dominions did not pass until 1832, when it was
introduced by Lord Stanley (the late Earl of Derby). A strong
feeling in favour of its abolition had however permeated society,
in consequence of the powerful representations made on the subject,
both in and out of the British Parliament, by Wilberforce and
Clarkson, "who had successfully shown," says Hamilton in his
"Outlines of the History of England," "that the effect of this
iniquitous system was no less injurious to the moral condition of
the people of England than it was to the physical well-being of the
African race." That no ill-feeling towards their masters generally
existed in Canada in the minds of the slaves may be fairly inferred
from the fact that, at their own request, a coloured regiment was
formed to assist in the defence of the country in 1812, and under
Captain Runchey did good service at the Battle of Queenston
Heights. In this connection it is also to be remembered that large
numbers of freedmen were to be found both in England and
Canada&mdash;men who for faithful or special services had received
the gift of freedom from their grateful and generous masters.</p>
<p>That the Legislature of Upper Canada was free even at that early
period to deal with its domestic questions is shown by the fact
that in 1793 an Act was passed at Newark, "forbidding the further
introduction of slaves into the province, and ordering that 'all
slave children born after the 9th of July in that year should be
free on attaining the age of twenty-five.'" To this Act is due the
fact that Canada was as early as 1800 a city of refuge for escaped
slaves, numbers of whom found their way hither from Baltimore and
Maryland. (<i>See</i> also <a href="#appendices">Appendix</a>.)</p>

<center>We'll have it though, and more, if Boerstler.</center>
<p>It has generally been stated that Mr. Secord heard of the
intended surprise of Fitzgibbon by accident. The facts of the case
are, however, related in the poem, Mrs. Smith, a daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Secord, who yet survives, being the authority.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith states that with the insolence of the victorious
invader, Dearborn's men came and went, ordered, or possessed
themselves of, whatever they chose, and took every form of
familiarity in the homes of the residents within their lines, and
that it was fast becoming an anxious question with the farmers and
others, what they should do for supplies if Dearborn were not
ousted within the season.</p>

 To make the British wince.</td></tr></table>
<p>The ill-feeling of the Americans towards British subjects can
scarcely be too strongly represented for the facts. A bitter
antagonism was naturally the feeling of each side so lately in the
deadly struggle of a civil war. To gloss over this state of things,
deplorable as it was, and as its results have often been, is to
belie history, and to no good or useful end. Had the contention
been akin to a mere friendly tug-of-war, as some would have it
represented now, lest a growing friendliness should be endangered,
it would be necessary for the historian to re-write all that has
been written, for otherwise the arguments of contention would have
no meaning, no <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>; in fact, they could
never have been formulated, for the premisses would have been
wanting. "He is the best cosmopolite, who for his country lives."
says some one, and it is to this truth that the peace of the world,
which we all wish to see established, will be owing, not to any
false representations in place of facts.</p>

<td>That hate to England, not our country's name<br>
 And weal, impelled mad Madison upon this war,<br>
 And shut the mouths of thousand higher men than
be.</td></tr></table>
<p>"The Democratic Party," says Col. Coffin (see "Chronicle of the
War," pp. 30-1-3), "eager to humble Britain, accepted any
humiliation rather than quarrel with France. They submitted to the
capture of ships, the sequestration of cargoes, the ransom of
merchandise, with a faint remonstrance. French war ships seized
American merchantmen at sea&mdash;plundered and burnt them. They
consoled themselves with the belief that the anticipated triumph of
the French Emperor in Europe would ensure their supremacy on this
continent. They were prepared to divide the world between them...."
In the words of the historian Alison, "the ostensible object of the
war was to establish the principle that the flag covers the
merchandise, <a name="page179"><!-- Begin Page 179 --></a> and that
the right of search for seamen who have deserted is inadmissible;
the real object was to wrest from Great Britain the Canadas, and,
in conjunction with Napoleon, extinguish its maritime and colonial
empire. Politicians, too, of this early American school had a
notion that French connection and the conquest of Canada were
synonymous terms. This was a great mistake ... but ... it had an
unexpected good effect, for the very suggestion of a French policy,
or the exercise of French influence, tested the British feeling
still latent in the hearts of thousands of Americans. In the New
England States a war with England was denounced.... Citizens of
these States expressed an abhorrence of France, and of its rule,
and protested against the contemplated introduction of French
troops on this continent, which, under the pretext of subduing or
seducing the French-Canadians, might prove to be subversive of
their own liberties.</p>
<p>"It is probable that to this spirit of truthful independence may
be ascribed the fact that during the whole of the ensuing war
(1812-15) the immense extent of frontier between Lower Canada and
the States of Vermont and New Hampshire and Maine was unassailed by
an enemy.... No hostile irruption was attempted upon the Province
from Lake Champlain to the ocean.... War was declared on the 18th
June, 1812, by Act of Congress. Mr. Madison, then President, who
had done all in his power to exasperate the existing ill-will, and
to lash the popular mind to frenzy, eluded the responsibility of
the fatal act, and made a cat's paw of the Legislature."</p>
<p>The people of the United States were disunited on the subject of
the war.... The Legislature of Maryland openly denounced the war.
The Governments of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island had
refused the quota of militia demanded of these States respectively.
Such men as Quincey declared in the House of Representatives at
Washington that "since the invasion of the Buccaneers, there was
nothing in history more disgraceful than this war." The same view
of President Madison's action is also held by Auchinleck, Christie,
and, indeed, by every trustworthy historian of the time.</p>
<h4>NOTE 9, <a href="#page025">page 25</a>.</h4>
<center>In opening up a road to reach the great Pacific.</center>
<p>In 1812 the vast promise of the West had begun to attract public
interest. The discovery of the Columbia River in Oregon, including
what is now Washington Territory, was made by Captain Gray, of
Boston, in 1792, and upon this was based the general claim of the
United States to the Territory. The British, however, held a prior
claim of occupation and discovery. In 1804-6 Captains Lewis and
Clarke explored the whole country from the mouth of the Missouri to
the mouth of the Columbia, and in 1811 Fort Astoria was built. The
Treaty of 1845 settled the question of claim to this Territory in
common with other Western lands in favour of the United States.
Although California was not largely settled by United States
subjects until the Treaty of 1844, yet its reputation for being a
gold-bearing <a name="page180"><!-- Begin Page 180 --></a> country
was well established, and had been increasing in public regard from
the time of its first exploration by Sir Francis Drake in 1570, who
expressed a strong opinion as to its auriferous character. Long
before the famous expedition of Colonel Fremont across "the

<center>Brock! MacDonell! Dennis!</center>
<p>It would be a work of supererogation to say anything of
Major-General Sir Isaac Brock here, so completely is his name
enshrined in Canadian history, literature, and tradition. I may,
however, be pardoned if I quote a few descriptive sentences to be
found in "A Chapter of the War of 1812," by Col. William Stanley
Hatch, Acting Assistant Quartermaster-General of the army with Hull
at Detroit.</p>
<p>"General Brock was an officer of distinction. His personal
appearance was commanding; he must have been six feet three or four
inches in height, very massive and large boned, though not fleshy,
and apparently of immense muscular power. His Aides were elegant
young men, very near, if not quite six feet in height, and in their
splendid uniforms all three presented a brilliant appearance. But
how transitory and evanescent the gratification of that day and
that event!" [the taking of Detroit]. "In a few short
weeks&mdash;less than two months&mdash;on the 13th October, 1812,
two of these noble men and gentlemanly officers had fallen. At this
distant day I feel it due to myself and to them to record the
sentiment of regret which impressed itself upon my mind when the
announcement came that General Brock and Colonel MacDonell, public
enemies as they were, had terminated their earthly career at
Queenston."</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonell, A.D.C. to General Brock, was "one
of five sons of a brother of MacDonell, Laird of Glengarry, who
bore a prominent part in supporting Prince Charles, called the
Pretender.... The family came out to this country shortly after the
American Revolution, and settled in the County of Glengarry among
other Scotch settlers, who had been located on lands in that county
upon the disbanding of the regiment known as the Royal Highland
Emigrants. Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonell came up to Toronto (then
York) and studied law, and was appointed Attorney-General of the
Province when a very young man, and afterwards accompanied, as
aide-de-camp, General Brock at Detroit and Queenston," where he
gloriously fell in the gallant charge that followed the fall of
Brock.&mdash;<i>Extract of private letter</i>. (<i>See</i> also
<a href="#appendices">Appendix</a>.)</p>
<p>"I have heard that he (Lieut.-Col. MacDonell) was brought up by
the late Hon. Alexander MacDonell, who gave him a valuable piece of
property in the then Town of York to start him in the legal
profession. On his way up the Niagara River with General Brock,
having a kind of presentiment of <a name="page181">
<!-- Begin Page 181 --></a> what might happen, the Colonel made his
will, and bequeathed the land referred to, to James MacDonell,
eldest son of the Hon. Alexander MacDonell. The land is now owned
by the widow of James (Mrs. M. S. MacDonell, living at 305 Bathurst
Street). It comprised the west side of Church Street, from
Wellington Street to King Street, and went some distance
west."&mdash;<i>Extract of private letter</i>.</p>
<p>Beside the lady above mentioned, several connections of
Lieut.-Col. MacDonell reside in Toronto, among them W. J.
MacDonell, Esq., French Vice-Consul; Angus D. MacDonell, Inland
Revenue Department; and Alex. MacDonell, Esq., Osgoode Hall. The
late Bishop MacDonell was also of this family, as were most of the
MacDonells who grace the pages of Canadian histories of the War of
1812.</p>
<p>Captain James Dennis&mdash;the third of the trio whom Mrs.
Secord apostrophises&mdash;then Lieutenant, had been among the
wounded on board the <i>Monarch</i> man-of-war at Copenhagen, but
recovered so as to accompany his regiment to Canada. In 1812 he was
in charge of one of the two flank companies of the 49th, stationed
at Queenston, and gallantly led the defence, directing the one-gun
battery and holding the enemy completely in check until their
discovery of a path to the summit of the Height turned the scale on
the wrong side, where it stood until the arrival of General Brock.
In the splendid charge up-hill Captain Dennis was wounded, and, it
was supposed, killed; he, however, bravely kept the field until the
day was won, despite pain and weakness. He was not related to the
Dennises of York, and Buttonwood, near Weston; but two members of
this family were in the York militia, and served at Queenston. The
late Bishop Richardson, an uncle of theirs, also served in the navy
on the lakes, where he lost an arm.</p>
<h4>NOTE 11, <a href="#page027">page 27</a>.</h4>
<center>The Widow, Stephen Secord.</center>
<p>This lady was the widow of Stephen, an elder brother of James
Secord, who, in conjunction with another brother, David, a major in
the militia, and after whom the village was named, built and owned
the grist mill at St. David's. Stephen Secord appears to have died
some years previous to the war, leaving a family of several sons.
With the wisdom and spirit of a sensible woman the widow carried on
the business, and thereby brought up her family. During the war all
her sons were variously engaged in it with the exception of the
youngest, and in the absence of sufficient help the widow worked
with her own hands, turning out flour for which the Government paid
her twenty dollars a barrel. Many of the Secords who are to be
found scattered through the Province at the present time are
children of her sons.</p>

<center>Sergeant George Mosier.</center>
<p>This character is singular in being the only pure invention in
the poem; and the name was chosen as being most unlikely to be
borne by any one in the neighbourhood of Queenston. By one of those
coincidences, however, <a name="page182">
<!-- Begin Page 182 --></a> that are not unknown, it appears that
there was a Captain Mosier living at Newark in 1812, and commanding
a vessel on Lake Ontario. Captain Mosier was of some service to the
British Government, and on one occasion was able to be of special
use in carrying off and concealing, until the mischievous effect
was over, a somewhat hot-headed gentleman who in the ardour of his
loyalty had thought it his solemn duty to cross the river and
bayonet the sentinel at Fort Niagara.</p>

<p>"On the withdrawal of the British troops, the battlefield of
Stony Creek was, as before said, for a short space re-occupied by
the Americans under Colonel Burns, a cavalry officer, upon whom the
command had devolved. He merely remained long enough to destroy the
tents ... and stores. He then rapidly retired to the protection of
the lines of Fort George, though in executing this manoeuvre he was
intercepted and suffered much. On their advance the Americans had
been accompanied all along the lake shore by a flotilla of boats
and batteaux. Burns fell back upon this support, and embarked his
wounded, and such of his men as had not yet got under cover, and
was slowly creeping down the coast to the place from whence he
came, when, on the 8th June, Sir James Yeo, who by this time had
become master of his own movements, and had got out of Kingston,
appeared in the offing; intelligence from the shore had apprised
him of the state of things, and of the position of the enemy; and
Richardson (the late James Richardson, D.D.) dwells with sailorly
impatience on the perversity of a calm.... A breeze sprung up and
the squadron closed in with the shore, cutting off the twelve
rearmost boats of the American flotilla, laden with valuable
supplies and stores. Perceiving an encampment in the woods on the
beach, the Commodore disembarked in the ship's boats two companies
of regulars under Major Evans of the 8th Regiment. This active
officer landed, and in the evening having been reinforced by two
companies from Burlington Heights under Colonel Bishopp, the second
deserted American camp was entered. It was in a state of
conflagration, ... but the captors saved from the flames 500 tents,
140 barrels of flour, 100 stand of arms.... Thus did this exploit
of Harvey free the whole Peninsula from the invaders, and threw
them back upon the mere edge of the frontier with a deep and
dangerous river in their rear, between them and their supports and
supplies."&mdash;<i>Col. Coffin's Chronicles of the War of

<center>The Lady Harriet Acland.</center>
<p>This lady was the daughter of Stephen, first Earl of Ilchester,
and accompanied her husband, Major John Dyke-Acland, to Canada in
1776.</p>
<p>The story put into the mouth of Sergeant George Mosier may be
found in the <i>Saturday Magazine</i> for May, 1835, and also in
Burke's "Romance of the Aristocracy." Her beauty, bravery and
tender love for her husband made the name of Lady Harriet Acland an
honour and delight among the men of her husband's regiment, and
thus it is that Sergeant Mosier is made her historian with great
propriety.</p>
<p>In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for February, 1778, I also
find the following note, p. 69, in "Extracts from the Congress
Accounts of the Northern Expeditions":</p>
<p>"Oct. 11.&mdash;Some letters passed between the Generals, the

<p>The Baroness Reidessel, the wife of one of the officers of the
Hessians. This lady, together with the wives of Major Harnage and
Lieutenant Reynell, was with Lady Acland during the painful march
that preceded the action of the 19th September, 1777. They had
followed the route of the artillery and baggage as being less
likely of attack on the road, and when the engagement begun found
themselves at a little uninhabited hut, from whence they could hear
the roll of the guns that were carrying death to scores of brave
men. Here they had to endure a great trial, for their only refuge
was also the only place to which the wounded, who soon began to
arrive in great numbers, could be brought for first care. Soon
Major Harnage was brought in desperately wounded. Not long after
the news arrived that Lieutenant Reynell was shot dead, and before
the day was done Major Acland was a prisoner dangerously wounded.
Herself saved for the present such terrible <a name="page184">

distinguished herself by her ministrations to her suffering

<center>"Rule Britannia."</center>
<p>This, together with "The King: God bless him," and "The Duke of
York's March" were at this period new and favourite tunes all over
the British Empire. In the <i>Times</i>, Oct. 3, 1798, under the
heading "Drury Lane Theatre," it is reported that "after the play
the news of Admiral Nelson's victory (over the French under Admiral
Brueys at Rosetta) produced a burst of patriotic exultation that
has been rarely witnessed in a theatre. 'Rule Britannia' was
lustily called for from every part of the house, and Messrs. Kelly,
Dignum, Sedgwick, Miss Leak and Mrs. Bland came forward and sang
it, accompanied by numbers of the audience. It was called for and
sung a second time. The acclamations were the loudest and most
fervent we have ever witnessed. The following lines, written for
the occasion, were introduced by Mr. Dignum and Mr. Sedgwick:</p>
<table align="center" summary="poem positioner">
<tr>
<td>"'Again the tributary strain<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Of grateful Britons, let us raise;<br>
 And to the heroes on the main,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Triumphant add a Nelson's praise.<br>
 Though the "Great Nation" proudly boasts<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Herself invincible to be,<br>
 Yet oft brave Nelson still can prove<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Britannia Mistress of the Sea.'</td></tr></table>
<p>"The audience was not satisfied with this repeated mark of
exultation, but in the effusion of enthusiasic loyalty called for
'God Save the King,' which was received with reiterated
plaudits."</p>
<p>In another column of the same issue it is told that, "A person
last night in the gallery of Drury Lane House calling frequently in
a boisterous manner for the tune of 'Britons, Strike Home!' was
immediately silenced by the appropriate observation of another at
some distance from him, 'Why, damn it, they have, haven't
they?'"</p>
<p>The great popularity of "Rule Britannia" was owing to its entire
consonance with the spirit of the nation, a popularity not even yet
diminished. A further instance of its use in the celebration of a
great national event is given in the <i>Times</i>, Nov. 7, 1805, in
which is recorded the official account of the Battle of Trafalgar
and the death of Nelson. At Covent Garden, where both the Kembles
were then playing together with Mrs. Siddons, a "hasty but elegant
compliment to the memory of Lord Nelson" was presented. It
"consisted of columns in the foreground decorated with medallions
of the naval heroes of Britain. In the distance a number of ships
were seen, and the front of the picture was filled by Mr. Taylor
and the principal singers of the theatre. <a name="page185">
<!-- Begin Page 185 --></a> They were grouped in an interesting
manner with their eyes turned toward the clouds, from whence a
half-length portrait of Lord Nelson descended with the following
words underwritten, 'Horatio Nelson, Ob. 21st Oct.'" Mr. Taylor and
the other performers then sang "Rule Britannia," verse and chorus.
The following additional verse, written by Mr. Ashley, of Bath, was
introduced and sung by Mr. Taylor with the most affecting
expression. It was universally encored:&mdash;</p>

<center>Can you wonder? ... shot at, etc.</center>
<p>The cruel treatment of the Loyalists, or <i>King's Men</i>, by
the <i>Continentals</i>, as they called themselves, is one of the
features of this painful time, records of which abound: the story
of Moody is well known: another as authentic may be here quoted.
The Rev. G. A. Anderson, late Chaplain to the Reformatory at
Penetanguishene, in writing to the press with reference to the U.
E. L. Celebration in 1884, says:</p>
<p>"My grandfather, Samuel Anderson, was born of Irish parents,
near Boston, 4th May, 1736.... He joined the King's forces, serving
under General Abercrombie ... then under General Amherst, ... and
was at the taking of Ticonderoga.... In 1775 he was offered a
captaincy in the <i>Continental</i> service which he peremptorily
refused. Some time after he was offered the command of a regiment;
this he also refused. He was at once suspected of being a <i>King's
Man</i>, taken prisoner, and with several others, confined in
Litchfield gaol, where he suffered almost death for two years. One
morning, having heard that he and his fellow-prisoners were to be
shot the following day, being a powerful man he wrenched the iron
bars from the windows, and, with his companions, escaped to
Canada....</p>
<p>A quotation from the "Boston Confiscation Act," Sept., 1778, ch.
48, speaks volumes as to the attitude of the new Republic towards
the Loyalists: "In Massachusetts a person suspected of enmity to
the Whig cause could be arrested under a magistrate's warrant, and
banished, unless he would swear fealty to the friends of liberty;
and the select-men of towns could prefer charges of political
treachery in town meetings, and the individual thus accused, if
convicted by a jury, could be sent into the enemy's jurisdiction.
Massachusetts also designated by name, and generally by occupation
and residence, three hundred and eight of her people, of whom
seventeen had been inhabitants of Maine who had fled from their
houses, and denounced against any one of them who should return
apprehension, imprisonment and <a name="page186">
<!-- Begin Page 186 --></a> transportation to a place possessed by
the British, and for a second voluntary return, without leave,
death, without the benefit of clergy. By another law the property
of twenty-nine persons, who were denominated 'notorious
conspirators,' was confiscated; of these fifteen had been appointed
'Mandamus Councillors,' two had been Governors, one
Lieutenant-Governor, one Treasurer, one Attorney-General, one Chief
Justice and four Commissioners of Customs."&mdash;Lorenzo Sabine,

<center>"James Coffin is good."</center>
<p>The name of Coffin is famous in the annals, military, naval and
civil, of Canada, and is scarcely less marked in the history of the
earlier United States of America. Two branches of the family came,
U. E. Loyalists, to Canada in 1775-78. One established itself on
the St. John, New Brunswick, the other in Quebec. "Twenty years
after the landing from the <i>Mayflower</i>, the first of the name
put in an appearance from Brixton, near Plymouth, South Devon,
England, at Newbury Port, in New Hampshire." James Coffin,
mentioned above, was the sixth son of John Coffin, who settled in
Quebec, and did such good service at the
<i>Pr&egrave;s-de-ville</i>, when Montgomery and Arnold invaded the
Province. Like all the Coffins, James was of a genial and kindly
disposition, and his appointment as a Commissary Officer permitted
opportunities for consideration and courtesy to people of all
ranks, which he did not fail to avail himself of. He died Assistant
Commissary-General in 1835, at Quebec.</p>

<p>"To the soldiers of this regiment (the 41st), as indeed to all

American Government encamped them, for nearly two months, in a
pestilential marsh near Sandusky without covering." (<i>See</i> Dr.

preserve the memory of the ancient settler on the spot in less

<center>Fitzgibbon.</center>
<p>This brave officer is thus described in the letter of "A Green
'Un," I have elsewhere quoted, and which was written in 1852, at
which date Colonel Fitzgibbon was yet alive:&mdash;"Colonel
Fitzgibbon has long been known in Canada, in both a civil and a
military capacity, and if he was now present he would be able to
give you much more interesting and valuable information. At the
time of this attack" (Black Rock, July 12th, 1813), "he was a
Lieutenant in the 49th, and his daring spirit and energy of
character were well known to the whole army. General Vincent had
placed him in command of a sort of independent company of Rangers.
Volunteers from the different regiments were asked for, and strange
to say so many men offered that it was difficult to decide who
should be permitted to go. From the numerous young subs. desirous
of joining him he selected his friend Lieutenant Winder of the 49th
(now Dr. Winder, Librarian to the House of Assembly at Quebec),
Volunteer D. A. McDonnell of the 8th, Volunteer Augustus Thompson
of the 49th; and another youngster of the 49th (the late Judge
Jarvis, of Cornwall) who were permitted as a great favour to join
his corps." Colonel Coffin in his "Chronicles of the War of 1812,"
gives a very full account of Colonel Fitzgibbon's career, of which
only a brief outline is proper here. Colonel James Fitzgibbon was
the son of an English farmer, had a little early education, and
acquired a <a name="page188"><!-- Begin Page 188 --></a> fondness
for reading; his passion for arms was irresistible. At seventeen he
enlisted, and the same day, 25th, October, 1798, was made a
sergeant. At twenty-one he was made Sergeant-Major. He served in
Ireland and before Copenhagen, where the 49th acted as marines. He
was appointed to an ensigncy and adjutancy, and came to Canada. In
1809 he succeeded to a lieutenancy; and resigned the adjutancy to
command a small detachment in the field. His exploits at the Beaver
Dam gave him his company. He thus rose by dint of meritorious
service, at a time when commissions and promotions were not so
freely given to deserving men as they are now. On this, and on all
other occasions, during the war, Fitzgibbon made his mark.</p>
<p>"At the close of the war, he settled in Canada, and filled many
offices of honour and emolument under the Government. His last
appointment was that of Clerk to the Legislative Council. He
retired on a pension, and returned to his native land, when, in
just appreciation of his services, he was made a Military Knight of
Windsor."</p>

<p>The majority of the men with Fitzgibbon at Beaver Dam belonged
to the 49th Regiment, to which Fitzgibbon himself belonged. It was
also Brock's regiment. He had joined it in 1791 at Barbadoes. The
regiment being removed to Jamaica, Brock was thence obliged to get
leave of absence in 1793 on account of his health. On June 24,
1795, after doing recruiting service both in England and Jersey, he
purchased his majority. Next year his regiment returned from
Jamaica, and on the 25th October, 1797, he purchased his
lieutenant-colonelcy, and soon after became senior
lieutenant-colonel. In August, 1799, the 49th Regiment was ordered
to Holland as part of the force under Sir Ralph Abercrombie. On the
return of the expedition, the 49th was again quartered in Jersey
until the spring of 1801, when it was despatched with the fleet for
the Baltic under Sir Hyde Parker. The same year the 49th returned
to England, and in the next spring was sent to Canada where it took
up its quarters at York (Toronto). On the flag of the regiment is
inscribed "Egmont-op-Zee," "Copenhagen," "Queenstown," and its
colours and appointments bear the word "China" and the device of
the Dragon.</p>
<p>Of the career of the 49th Regiment in Canada during the war of
1812-15, it is impossible to speak too highly. From their
brilliancy of attack and energy in action the American soldiers
dubbed them the "Green Tigers," and on the fatal day at Queenston,
those of the wounded who had passed over "had described the charge
of the 'Green Tigers' and militia in the morning, and had warned
them what they might expect if they came in contact with troops
infuriated by the loss of their beloved General" (Auchinleck, p.
106.) That the 49th revelled in the honour conferred by such a
<i>soubriquet</i> is clear from the fact that Fitzgibbon's company
dubbed themselves "Fitzgibbon's Green 'Uns," and one of them, the
late Judge Jarvis, of Cornwall, then a cadet of eighteen, says,
over the <i>nom de plume</i>' "A Green 'Un," in Auchinleck: "We
were all dressed in green uniform made from clothing which had been
taken from the enemy."</p>
<a name="page190"><!-- Begin Page 190 --></a>
<p>In a private letter to the writer Judge Jarvis says, under date
<i>Cornwall, 7th November</i>, 1876: "The uniform of the 49th was,
of course, of a scarlet colour with green facings, rather a light
green. Around the edges of the cuffs and collar was a band of gold
lace one inch wide, thus (a drawing is given).</p>
<p>"The militia had no uniform during the War of 1812; they were
furnished with a blanket only." At the taking of Fort Detroit the
militia are generally said to have been in uniform, but these were
only a few and in the first engagement.</p>
<p>"The Americans wore coarse grey or blue cloth, mostly the
former." Homespun; in pursuance of the line of action required by
the blockade. "One regiment, the Irish Greens, wore dark green
cloth, but they were not at either Stony Creek or Beaver Dam."</p>

<p>Queen Charlotte's intense admiration for all nobility of

("Heart of Midlothian"), to whom she showed the most marked

<p>James Cummings, of Chippewa, was engaged in the Indian trade. He
accompanied Clark's plucky expedition on Black Rock, when they
surprised the work, captured the guard together with several stand
of arms, one brass six-pounder, and a large store of provisions. On
Bishopp hearing of this exploit, he fired up, "Hang the fellow, he

Hamilton, father of the Hamilton who gave his name to the
flourishing and rising city which still bears it, so early as the
year 1800, at which period he owned the mills afterwards known as
the Thomas's Mills, upon the Twelve-Mile Creek, up to which point
boats at that time ascended. But it was not until after the war,
viz., in 1816, that the town-plot of St. Catharines was first
purchased and laid out as a village by the Hon. W. H. Merritt and
Jonathan H. Clendennen, and received the name of St. Catharines, in
honour of Mrs. Robert Hamilton, whose name was Catharine."</p>

<center>I have friends beyond.</center>
<p>These were the household of Miss Tourney, an intimate friend of
Mrs. Secord, and owner of a large farm some three miles beyond
Beaver Dam. To this house Mrs. Secord proceeded, accompanied by an
escort furnished by Lieut. Fitzgibbon, but, it need hardly be said,
not exactly in the manner described. Here "she slept right off, for
she had journeyed on foot twenty miles, and safely, God be
praised." Mrs. Secord returned to her anxious husband on the third
day after having started on her perilous undertaking, but neither
through the woods, nor on foot, thanks to her brave deed, and the
success of British arms.</p>

<center>Ye Yankee rogue! ye coward!</center>
<p>This incident, which Col. Coffin places as preceding the
occupation of Beaver Dam by Fitzgibbon, is thus described by Judge
Jarvis in a letter subsequent to the one already quoted, and which
was apparently dictated by the awakening of did memories by the
enquiries that led to the former letter: "Although I write with
great labour and pain" [the result of rheumatism] "I cannot refrain
from giving you the following incident. Lieut. Fitzgibbon, who
always preferred going on any dangerous expedition to sending any
other person, on receiving the information of the patriotic woman,
went forward to reconnoitre. On approaching a small tavern two
American soldiers came out of the door, and immediately presented
their rifles. He seized the rifles, and crossed them in front of
his person" [Col. Coffin says: He seized the musket of the more
advanced man and by main strength threw him upon his fellow, whose
musket he also grappled with the other hand'] "so that neither
could fire without shooting his fellow-soldier. Here he held them
until one of them drew Lieut. Fitzgibbon's sword, and held it up
over his head, of course intending to stab him forthwith. The woman
of the house saw the position, and rushed out and seized the sword,
and got it from the soldier's hand. Fitzgibbon then tripped up one
of the soldiers and felled the other with a blow, then took them
both prisoners and marched them into the line occupied by his
company."</p>
<p>It is a pity this brave woman's name cannot be discovered in
order that it might be added to the roll of those patriotic women
whose names adorn Canadian history.</p>

<center>Lieut.-Col. Thomas Clark.</center>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Clark, of the 2nd Lincoln Militia, was, says
Colonel Coffin, "a Scotchman by birth." He "was an Indian trader
and forwarder of goods to the Western hunting grounds; a member of
the firm of Street &amp; Clark.... From the first outbreak of the
war Clark was foremost in frontier frail. He had acquired the
confidence of his men, and obtained the cordial co-operation of
those who, like Bishopp, understood volunteers, and could
appreciate the merits of the extemporaneous soldier."</p>

<p>These were militia. "Old Isaac Kelly," says Colonel Coffin
(Chronicles of the War of 1812), "born and raised on 48 Thorold, a
septuagenarian, hale and hearty, who still [in 1864] lives not a
mile from the spot, tells how, when he was a boy of eighteen, and
was in the act of 'hitching up' his horses for the plough, he heard
the firing in the wood, and outcries of the Indians; how he ran to
his two brothers, both a-field; how the three got their
muskets&mdash;they were all militiamen&mdash;men home to put in a
crop; how, led by the sounds, they crossed the country to the beech
grove, meeting eight or ten more by the way, suddenly roused, like
themselves; how, from behind the trees, they opened fire on the
American train, and on the guns which were then unlimbering to the

changed their position, and took-up ground in David Millar's apple

<p>The war was declared on the 18th of June, and at once every able
male in the Provinces sprang to arms. The necessary absence from
their farms thus forced upon them curtailed the sowing, and
lessened the harvest, though the women and children of every rank
did their utmost to countervail the losses thus threatened. The
next year there was less to sow and less, consequently, to reap,
notwithstanding the leave granted to the militia at all possible
junctures, to attend to their work; but intermittent farming is not
more successful than other occasionally prosecuted labour, and the
war laid bare many previously fruitful clearings.</p>

according to the ideas of the time, that by so doing he should save
his wife's life; he also sucked the poison from <a name="page194">

her to her cottage the foot had burst. An Indian remedy was
applied, but it was years before she recovered from the effects of
that bite. In the meantime two children were born, each of whom
turned spotted and sore, and then died. A third born after her
recovery was strong and healthy, and grew to manhood.</p>

enormous force, was content to remain without striking a blow,
unless an occasional demonstration before Forts George and
Mississaga, or the wanton conflagration of the village of St
David's, be considered as such."</p>
<p>Of this atrocity an American officer, a Major McFarland,
writes:&mdash;"The militia and Indians plundered and burnt every
thing. The whole population is against us; not a foraging party but
is fired on, and not infrequently returns with missing numbers.
This state was to be anticipated The militia have burnt several
private dwelling-houses, and, on the 19th instant, burnt the
village of St. David's, consisting of about thirty or forty houses.
This was done within three miles of camp, and my battalion was sent
to cover the retreat, as they [the militia] had been sent to scour
the country, and it <a name="page195"><!-- Begin Page 195 --></a>

the service by sentence of a court-martial for this deed] "and sent

<h3>THE HERO OF ST. HELEN'S ISLAND.</h3>
<h4>NOTE 1, <a href="#page086">page 86</a>.</h4>
<p>This touching incident, bright example as it is of that fine
sense of duty that has built up the renown of the British Army, is
related in his charming volume, "The Emigrant," by Sir Francis Bond
Head. The author, in introducing it, says: "In the different
regions of the globe it has been my fortune to visit, I have always
experienced great pleasure in pausing for a few minutes at the
various spots which have been distinguished by some feat or other
of British enterprise, British mercy, British honesty, British
generosity or British valour.</p>
<p>"About the time I was in Canada a trifling circumstance occurred
on the breaking up of the ice, which I feel proud to record.</p>
<p>"In the middle of the great St. Lawrence there is, nearly
opposite Montreal, an island called St. Helen's, between which and
the shore the stream, about three quarters of a mile broad, runs
with very great rapidity, and yet, notwithstanding this current,
the intense cold of winter invariably freezes its surface.</p>
<p>"The winter which I am speaking of was unusually severe, and the
ice on the St. Lawrence particularly thick; however, while the
river beneath was rushing towards the sea, the ice was waiting in
abeyance in the middle of the stream until the narrow fastness
between Montreal and St. Helen's should burst, and allow the whole
mass to break into pieces, and then in stupendous confusion to
hurry downwards towards Quebec." The story follows, and in winding
up the account Sir Francis says: "Colour-Sergeant William Delaney,
and Private George Morgan, of the 24th Regiment now at Chatham,
were eye-witnesses of the above occurrence."</p>
<p>The dangers Sergeant Neill so bravely encountered are thus
graphically depicted by Sir Francis B. Head on p. 42 of the same
volume, in describing the breaking up of the ice of the River
Humber, a stream not a tenth of the length or breadth of the St.
Lawrence, so that the scene bears but a slight comparison to that
witnessed on the larger river. "... As soon as the great movement
commenced, these trees and the ice were hurried before my eyes in
indescribable confusion. Every piece of ice, whatever might be its
shape or size, as it proceeded, was either revolving horizontally
or rearing up on end until it reeled over; sometimes a tree
striking against the bottom would rise slowly up, and for a moment
stand erect as if it grew out of the river; at other times it
would, apparently for variety's sake, stand on its head with its
roots uppermost and then turn over; sometimes the ice as it
proceeded would rise up like a house and chimneys, and then rolling
head over heels, sink, leaving in its place clear water.</p>
<p>"In a few hours the turmoil was completely at an end, the
torrent had diminished, the stream had shrunk to its ordinary
limits, and nothing. remained to tell of the struggle." (<i>See</i>

to entertain the application of ladies to be admitted to the
lectures of University College, and that such an adventure with its
<i>denouement</i> did not become a fact is only to be credited to
the wisdom that, on further consideration, withdrew the objection,
for history affords many instances of woman's use of a disguise in

<p>[The following account of 13th Oct., 1812, written by
Lieut.-Colonel Evans, of the Eighth or King's Regiment, Acting
Brigade-Major to the Forces at that date, will be read with
interest, and is doubly valuable as being a piece of well-attested
history.]</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">GOVERNMENT HOUSE, Fort George. Oct.
15, 1812.</p>
<p>After dinner on the evening of the 11th inst., Major-General
Brock handed me a note from Captain Dennis, commanding flank
companies of the 49th Regiment at Queenstown. After perusing its
contents, which were of an alarming nature, setting forth the
highly mutinous state of his detachment, his men having
deliberately threatened to shoot their officers, etc., the General
said, "Evans, you will proceed early in the morning and investigate
this business, and march, as prisoners, in here, half-a-dozen of
those most culpable, and I will make an example of them. You can
also cross the river and tell Van Rensellaer I expect he will
immediately exchange the prisoners taken in the <i>Detroit</i> and
<i>Caledonia</i> [two vessels coming from Amherstburgh cut out by
Americans whilst at anchor at Fort Erie] for an equal number of
Americans I released after the capture of Detroit."</p>
<p>I reached Queenstown early in the morning of the 12th, and
finding many of the grenadier company confined, and the guard-house
gutted, and Captain Dennis himself in apparent alarm at the state
of things, I proposed proceeding at once to select those most
prominent, for example. At this juncture, however, and when about
leaving Hamilton's house [Captain Dennis' quarters] a scattered
fire of musquetry from the American shore took place, and on a
musket ball entering the room passing betwixt us, I inquired with
surprise the meaning of such unusual insolence. Captain Dennis
stating the practice to have existed more or less for some days,
insomuch as to render ingress by the river door hazardous, I deemed
it fitting first to cross the river, desiring Captain Dennis would
prepare his men against my return. On passing along the river bank
for Mr. T. Dickson, the enemy kept up an incessant fire of
musquetry till I entered that gentleman's house, but happily
without mischief. I now begged Mrs. Dickson kindly to, prepare a
white handkerchief as a flag of truce, asking Mr. Dickson, who was
a Captain of Militia, would he accompany me across the water; he
had no objection, but both Mrs. Dickson and all present urged the
danger of any attempt to cross, convinced as they were, in the
enemy's then temper, the flag would not be respected. Feeling
<a name="page202"><!-- Begin Page 202 --></a> this to be no time
for discussing about personal safety, I took Dickson by one hand
and the flag in the other, then descending the precipitous steep to
the water's edge, we launched our frail canoe amidst an unsparing
shower of shot which fell all around us; nor did the firing cease
till the canoe, become quite unmanageable, tossed about in the
waters of the strong eddies; when, as if struck by shame at his
dastardly attempt to deter us from our purpose the enemy gave the
signal to cease fire. I was thus relieved (and enabled) on
approaching the shore to observe more calmly all that was passing.
On touching the ground, with water in the leaky canoe ankle deep, I
was about, as was my custom, leaping ashore, when a sentinel from a
guard brought to the spot, came to the charge with fixed bayonet,
authoritatively commanding me not to leave the boat. To my enquiry
for Colonel Solomon Van Rensellaer, (the Adjutant-General) with
whom I usually conferred, I was told he was sick. I then stated
having an important message from General Brock for their Commander,
which if inconvenient for their General to receive from me
personally, I begged an official person might be immediately
deputed to convey it to him. After some delay, Mr. Toock, the
General's Secretary, made his appearance, but his reply to General
Brock's request being abrupt, and as I thought somewhat
significant, "that nothing could be done till the day after
to-orrow," I ventured to remind him of General Brock's liberality
towards their people which the fortune of war had thrown into his
hands, entreating that he would again consult his General, and
enable me to carry to mine something more satisfactory. In
compliance, as he stated, with my wishes, but as it appeared to me,
more with the intent to consume my time, rendered precious from its
being after midday, he detained me in my miserable position for
more than two hours, and then returned expressing the General's
regret "that the prisoners having been marched for Albany they
could not instanter be brought back, but that might assure General
Brock with his respects that all should be settled to their mutual
satisfaction the day after to-morrow." I was now too anxious to
depart to wish the parley prolonged, my mind being quite made up as
to the enemy's intentions, and to the course it was most fitting
for me to pursue under the circumstances. It had not escaped me
that their saucy numbers had been prodigiously swelled by a horde
of half-savage troops from Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee, which
evidently made it hazardous for their northern countrymen to show
their accustomed respect for a flag of truce from a foe; but my
most important discovery was their boats slung in the sides or
fissures on the river bank covered only by the brush, with indeed
many decided indications that an attack on our shores could not be
prudently delayed for a single day. Under such impression the first
thing on reaching our own side was the removal by Mr. Dickson of
his family from his own house on the beach, the very site of the
prospective struggle, and giving note of preparation to the few
militia which, with the 49th flank companies, were all the
immediate disposable force for the defence of Queenstown. Aware of
the imminence and magnitude of the danger, the lateness of the
hour, after <a name="page203"><!-- Begin Page 203 --></a> three
p.m., and distance from Fort George, Headquarters more than six
miles, I hesitated not assuming the responsibility of liberating
all the 49th prisoners, on the specious plea of their offence
proceeding from a too free indulgence in drink, appealing to them
for proof of their loyalty and courage, which they were assured
would be severely tested ere another day dawned. Then, after a
rapid but effective arrangement of the several points requiring
attention, seeing to the re-supply of fresh ammunition, and
infusing all the spirit and animation in my power to impart, I left
Captain Dennis, exhorting his utmost diligence in keeping his
charge on the alert for repelling the enemy's attempt, which I
foresaw would not be deferred. Having to put the many posts on the
line of communication on the <i>qui vive</i>, although I rode at
full speed, it was past six p.m. ere I reached Fort George, and
then from having been exposed for thirteen hours, under much
anxiety, to wet feet and extreme heat, without refreshment of any
kind, I was so exhausted as to be unequal to further immediate
effort. Refreshed, I narrated to General Brock all that had
occurred, the precautionary steps I had taken, and the
responsibility I had assumed as to the 49th prisoners, which, under
the stated circumstances, I trusted he would approve, and at once
authorize my making preparations for coming events, so
indispensably required. The General evidently doubting at first,
hesitated, but seeing my earnestness in rebuking his attendants of
charging my being over-sanguine, and chagrin at their proffered
bets against my predictions, he became unusually grave, desired I
would follow him to the office, where at his request I succinctly
recapitulated the day's occurrences, adding my solemn conviction
that a moment was not to be lost in effectually preparing for
defence.</p>
<p>The General now thanked me, approved of all that I had done,
and, returning to the dining room, directed officials to be
immediately written and despatched by Provincial Dragoons, calling
in the militia of the vicinity that same evening, those more
distant to follow with all alacrity. I was directed to make all
requisite preparations at Headquarters. In this work I was busied
till near eleven p.m., with but few converts, however, to my
convictions, when, worn down by fatigue, I stretched myself on my
mattrass. After a slumber of a few hours I was aroused by a distant
cannonade soon after two a.m., 13th October, but without surprise,
well knowing the quarters where the ominous sound came. The General
who, himself, had all in readiness at once mounted his horse and
proceeded for the post attacked. His Aides-de-Camp were awoke, and
soon followed. Major-General Sheaffe, second in command, assumed
charge at Headquarters, but the impression on General Brock's mind
being that the attempt at Queenstown would prove only a feint to
disguise his (the enemy's) real object from the creek in rear of
Fort Niagara, his apparent wish was that whilst all were held in
readiness to act in any quarter, no decisive movement by the troops
should take place till the enemy's intentions were fully developed.
The Indians and regular Artillery were, however, promptly
despatched, and the <i>elite</i> of the 41st with an equal
   <a name="page204"><!-- Begin Page 204 --></a> number of
   well-drilled militia flank companies ready to follow on the
   first summons. As the day dawned, the scouts I had sent out
   reporting no symptoms of hostile movement in the quarter
   indicated, these troops all proceeded at double quick for the
   succour of Queenstown, the debouching of the head of which
   column on the main road appeared to be the signal for opening a
   brisk cannonade from Fort Niagara on the troops, the town, and
   Fort.</p>
<p>Soon after, the news of the gallant Brock's unhappy fall reached
us, which, by necessarily removing General Sheaffe to Queenstown,
the command at Fort George devolved on me as next senior officer.
At this moment the scene around was awfully discouraging, the gaol
and court house were suddenly wrapped in flames, which as
containing many political prisoners, I at first imagined the act of
an incendiary, but other buildings soon appearing in a similar
state of conflagration left me no longer in doubt as to the new
enemy of hot shot with which we had to grapple, and its easy
distance, on wooden edifices I foresaw, must be attended with very
destructive effect. Luckily, a <i>posse</i> of militia-men had now
come in, which I distributed in separate bodies, collecting all the
water-buckets and requisite implements from the inhabitants of the
town.</p>
<p>This arrangement, though in part effective, from the energy and
courage displayed in extinguishing the flames as they occurred, I
felt to be insufficient in itself for our security; selecting
therefore, all the old veteran militia artillerymen with two
intelligent staff non-commissioned officers of the 41st, by bending
our whole efforts to the attainment of one object, we at length
succeeded in stopping the mischief by diminishing and crippling the
enemy's guns, but not before he had burnt to the ground many
buildings, amongst the number, beside the gaol and court house, the
Chief Engineer's quarters; the more important ones, however, the
"Royal Barracks," "Block House," "King's Stores" and other public
buildings, though repeatedly fired were, by steady and untiring
intrepidity, preserved. Thus temporarily relieved, I was enabled to
attend to Capt. Derinzy's (commanding 41st Batt.) note, from which
it appeared, he found on arriving at Queenstown, the enemy in
possession of the opposite heights, and our heavy one-gun battery
there:&mdash;that the enfilading on our side, too distant from the
landing to be quite effective&mdash;then protected by his
division&mdash;had been powerfully aided by Capt. Holcroft, of the
Royal Artillery, who, unmindful of consequences, boldly dashed his
gun through the valley into Hamilton's court-yard within point
blank range, thus succeeding in sinking some of the enemy's crowded
boats and damping the ardour of his troops for crossing. Seeing his
critical position Capt. Derinzy had sustained him by a party of the
41st Regiment. He briefly mentioned that the spirited Brock finding
on his arrival the 49th grenadiers and militia, though resolutely
defending the landing-place, hard pressed, had called to their aid
the 49th light company from the Height's summit, the key of the
position. The enemy, profiting by this step, moved unperceived
about 150 men&mdash;and over a precipitous steep it was deemed
impracticable for a human <a name="page205">
<!-- Begin Page 205 --></a> being to ascend&mdash;who suddenly
appeared to the astonished General just on the mountain summit, and
the next instant in possession of the redoubt, putting its
defenders to the sword. The gallant spirit of Brock, ill brooking
to be thus foiled, with a courage deserving a better fate, hastily
collected the weak 49th company and a few militia; debouching from
a stone building at the mountain's brow, with these little bands,
he spiritedly strove to regain his lost position, but in which
daring attempt he was killed by a rifle ball entering under the
left breast, passing out by the right shoulder. Capt. Williams by
taking a wider range, made a second effort, but as the result
proved with too inadequate a force, the A.D.C. (McDonell), being
mortally wounded and Capt. Williams' head partially scalped by a
rifle ball.</p>
<p>These circumstances convinced me General Sheaffe would be more
circumspect than attack without a concentration of every disposable
man. Under such impressions, after first despatching Lieutenant
McIntyre, 41st Regiment, with about 140 men of his regiment and
militia, and afterwards Wm. Martin with every regular soldier and a
few active militia from Fort George, I hastened to forward, at all
hazards, the most active of the men from the many posts on the line
of communication. On starting those from Young's Battery, the
enemy, as though by signal, re-opened his cannonade from Fort
Niagara on Fort George and the town. However mortified by this
unlooked-for occurrence, prudence required that whilst sending our
whole effective force to Queenstown, Fort George and its
dependencies should not be neglected, for what with the alien and
prisoners in the Block House, with those set at liberty by firing
the gaol, their number was little short of 300, with but a few raw
militia left for their security, or that of the fort or town. I
was, therefore, left no alternative but to gallop back and
ascertain the enemy's power for further mischief. Well it was that
I did so, for on reaching the gate of Fort George, I met a crowd of
the militia with consternation in their countenances, exclaiming
the magazine was on fire. Knowing it to contain 800 barrels of
powder, with vent side-walls, not an instant was to be lost.
Captain Vigoreux, of the Engineers, therefore, at my suggestion,
was promptly on its roof, which movement was with alacrity followed
by the requisite number of volunteers, when by the tin being
stripped off the blazing wood was extinguished. Thus was confidence
reassured. The enemy, taking advantage of a bend in the river, had
brought a battery with hot shot to enfilade the barracks, magazine
and King's stores, and despite all our efforts to dislodge him he
had effectively consumed the store-houses with all the lower
buildings, and repeatedly set on fire the barracks and magazine.
Our success was perfect: the enemy's fire being again silenced and
the necessary precautions taken to avert future disaster, I made
another effort to reach Queenstown, when I met Captain Chambers,
41st Regiment, with the glad tidings that General Sheaffe, by a
spirited and judicious movement away to his right, and crossing the
vale high up with his collected forces, had approached&mdash;as to
ground&mdash;his enemy on more favourable terms, and that his
operations had <a name="page206"><!-- Begin Page 206 --></a>
resulted in the enemy's complete destruction. But, for the details
of this brilliant success I must refer to the despatches of the
distinguished officer who, with his gallant troops, achieved
it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(Signed) THOMAS EVANS,<br>
 <i>Brigade-Major to the Forces</i>.</p>
<p>[The statement made above by Lieut.-Col. Evans that in the 49th
were still smouldering the fires of the insubordination that Brock
himself had summarily dealt with several years before, is as
remarkable as it is painful to those who would fain think a
regiment famed for its brave achievements in so many engagements,
and to which Brock had belonged for many years, could not be guilty
of anything so disgraceful as is insubordination. It must, however,
be remembered that of all duties, garrison duty is most trying to
the soldier, and to these men, the greater part of whom were
veterans who had fought at Bergen-op-Zoom and Copenhagen, where
they had acted as marines, anything approaching to the spirit of
the martinet in their superior officers must have been very
galling.</p>
<p>To this want of tact on the part of certain officers is
attributed, by those who have enquired most carefully into the
matter, the uncomfortable state of the gallant 49th at and before
the epoch of the war.</p>
<p>Even Brock himself was tired of garrison life at such a stirring
time at home, and had applied for active service in Europe, and
Major-General Sheaffe had actually been appointed to his offices,
both civil and military, when the declaration of war by President
Madison gave him the employment he was looking for.]</p>

<h3>APPENDIX NO. 2.</h3>
<p>[From the other end of the Niagara Frontier comes an equally
interesting account of that notable day&mdash;the 13th Oct., 1812,
that of Lieutenant Driscoll of the 100th Regiment. (See Ryerson's
"Loyalists of America and their Times." Vol. 2, pages 36-81.)]</p>
<p>"I was stationed at Fort Erie on the memorable 13th Oct., 1812.
At daybreak, having returned with my escort as visiting rounds,
after a march of about six miles in muddy roads through the
forests, and about to refresh the inward man after my fatiguing
trudge, I heard a booming of distant artillery very faintly
articulated.</p>
<p>"Having satisfied myself of the certainty of my belief, wet and
fatigue were no longer remembered; excitement banishes these
trifling matters from the mind; and I posted off to my commanding
officer to report the firing, now more audible and rapid.</p>
<p>"I found my chief, booted and spurred and snoring&mdash;lying,
as was his wont, on a small hair mattrass on the floor in his
barrack room, which boasted of furniture, one oak table covered
with green baize, a writing desk, a tin basin containing water and
a brass candlestick, which had planted in it a regulation
mutton-dip, dimly flickering its last ray of light, paling before
the dawn, now making its appearance through the curtainless
window.</p>
<a name="page207"><!-- Begin Page 207 --></a>
<p>"The noise I made on entering the Major's sleeping and other
apartment awoke him. As he sat up on his low mattrass he said,
'What is the matter?' 'Heavy firing down the river, sir.' 'Turn the
men out.' 'All under arms, sir.' 'That'll do.'</p>
<p>"By this time he was on his legs&mdash;his hat and gloves on.
His hutman was at the door with his charger, and his spurs in his
horses' flanks in an instant&mdash;leaving the orderly, hutman, and
myself to double after him up to the fort, some hundred yards
off.</p>
<p>"As we reached it, the men were emerging through the gate in
measured cadence, and we were on our way to the batteries opposite
the enemy's station at Black Rock.</p>
<p>"Before we reached our post of alarm the sun was up and bright.
We had not assumed our position long before an orderly officer of
the Provincial Dragoons rode up, and gave us the information that
the enemy were attempting to cross at Queenston, and that we must
annoy them along the whole line, as was being done from Niagara to
Queenston, by any and every means in our power short of crossing
the river. Everything was ready on our part. The enemy all appeared
asleep, judging from the apparent quiet that prevailed on their
side the river.</p>
<p>"The command to annoy the enemy was no sooner given than bang!
bang! went off every gun that we had in position.</p>
<p>"Now there was a stir. The enemy's guns were in a short time
manned, and returned our fire; and the day's work was begun, which
was carried on briskly the greater part of the day on both sides of
the Niagara.</p>
<p>"About two o'clock, another Provincial Dragoon, bespattered,
horse and man, with foam and mud, made his appearance, not wearing
sword or helmet.</p>
<p>"Said an old Green Tiger to me: 'Horse and man jaded, sir;
depend upon it he brings bad news.' 'Step down and ascertain what
intelligence he brings.' Away my veteran doubles, and soon returns
at a funeral pace.</p>
<p>"Light heart, light step," were my inward thoughts. I knew by
poor old Clibborn's style of return something dreadful had
occurred. 'What news, Clibborn? What news, man? Speak out,' said I,
as be advanced towards the battery that was still keeping up a
brisk fire. Clibborn walked on, perfectly unconscious of the balls
that were ploughing up the ground, uttered not a word but shook his
head.</p>
<p>"When in the battery the old man sat down on the platform; still
no word, but the pallor and expression of his countenance indicated
the sorrow of his soul.</p>
<p>"I could stand it no longer. I placed my hand on his shoulder.
'For Heaven's sake, tell us what you know.' 'In choking accents he
revealed his melancholy information: 'The General is killed; the
enemy has possession of Queenstown Heights.'</p>
<p>"Every man in the battery was paralyzed; the battery ceased
firing.</p>
<p>"A cheer by the enemy from the opposite side of the river
recalled us to our duty. They had heard of their success down the
river. Our men, who <a name="page208"><!-- Begin Page 208 --></a>
had in various ways evinced their feelings&mdash;some in weeping,
some in swearing&mdash;some in mournful silence&mdash;now exhibit
demoniac energy. The heavy guns are loaded, traversed and fired, as
if they were field pieces.</p>
<p>"Too much hurry for precision. 'Take your time, men; don't throw
away your fire, my lads.' 'No, sir, but we'll give it to them hot
and heavy.'</p>
<p>"All the guns were worked by the 49th men of my own company, and
they wished to avenge their beloved chief. Brock, whom they knew
and valued with that correct appreciation peculiar to the British
soldier. They had all served under him in Holland and at
Copenhagen.</p>
<p>"I had a very excellent reconnoitering glass; and as I kept a
sharp lookout for the effect of our fire, and the movements of the
enemy, I observed that powder was being removed from a large wooden
barrack into ammunition waggons. The only man of the Royal
Artillery I had with me was a bombardier, Walker. I called his
attention to the fact I had observed, and directed him to lay a gun
for that part of the building wherefrom the powder was being taken.
At my request he took a look through my glass, and, having
satisfied himself, he laid the gun as I ordered. I, with my glass,
watched the spot aimed at. I saw one plank of the building fall
out, and at the same instant the whole fabric went up in a pillar
of black smoke, with but little noise, and it was no
more&mdash;horses, waggons, men and building all disappeared; not a
vestige of any was to be seen.</p>
<p>"Now was our turn to cheer; and we plied the enemy in a style so
quick and accurate that we silenced all their guns just as a third
dragoon came galloping up to us, shouting 'Victory! Victory!' Then
again we cheered lustily, but no response came from the other side.
Night now hid the enemy from our sight.</p>
<p>"The commissariat made its appearance with biscuit, pork, rum
and potatoes, and we broke our fast for that day about nine
p.m.</p>
<p>"How strange and unaccountable are the feelings induced by war!
Here were men of two nations, but of a common origin, speaking the
same language, of the same creed, intent on mutual destruction,
rejoicing with fiendish pleasure at their address in perpetrating
murder by wholesale, shouting for joy as disasters propagated by
the chance of war hurled death and agonizing wounds into the ranks
of their opponents! And yet the very same men, when chance gave
them the opportunity, would readily exchange, in their own peculiar
way, all the amenities of social life, extending to one another a
draw of the pipe, a quid or glass; obtaining and exchanging
information from one and the other of their respective services, as
to pay, rations, etc., the victors with delicacy abstaining from
any mention of the victorious day. Though the vanquished would
allude to their disaster, the victors never named their
triumphs.</p>
<p>"Such is the character of acts and words between British and
American soldiers, which I have witnessed, as officer commanding a
guard over American prisoners.</p>

<p>[Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp was a son of Sir Cecil Bishopp,
Bart., afterwards Lord de la Zouche. He was an accomplished
gentleman. He had served in the Guards. Had represented Newport, in
the Isle of Wight, in Parliament. Had been attached to a Russian
embassy. Had served with distinction in Flanders, in Spain, in
Portugal and died full of hope and promise in Canada, gallantly
"doing his duty," and not without avail, for his example still
lives.]</p>
<p>"At two a.m. on the morning of the 11th July, 1813, accompanied
by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Clark, and Lieutenant James Cummings
(both of the Lincoln Militia), backed by about 240 men&mdash;200
being regulars, and forty of the 2nd and 3rd Lincoln Militia,
Bishopp swooped down upon Black Rock, the American naval depot on
the River Niagara.</p>
<p>"The assault was a success; the work of destruction of the naval
stores, chiefly by sinking them in the river, was complete. But
Porter's force was aroused, and a speedy retreat on the part of
Bishopp necessary. The men re-embarked unmolested, and Bishopp was
the last to retire. Scarcely had they left the bank when the
Indians who had crawled to the top commenced to fire. Part of
Bishopp's men were landed and drove the enemy back into the
woods.... Bishopp was everywhere commanding, directing, getting his
men off. In the confusion of the moment some of the oars of his own
boat were lost, and she drifted helplessly down stream exposed to
an ever-increasing fire. Here Bishopp received his death-wound. He
was borne back to his quarters, where, in a few days he expired at
the early age of twenty-seven. 'Never was any officer, save always
the lamented Brock, regretted more than he was.' His remains lie
beneath a modest monument erected to his memory by the pious care
of his sisters, the Baroness de la Zouche and Mrs. Pechall, in the
churchyard at Lundy's Lane."&mdash;<i>Coffin's Chronicles</i>.</p>

head, sound judgment, energy, and capability in administration made
him a tower of strength to his superiors, all of whom at various
times, took an opportunity of testifying to his merits.]</p>
<p>On the 17th August, 1812, the day after the surrender of
Detroit, General Brock wrote to him:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dear Evans,&mdash;Detroit is ours, and with it the whole
Michigan Territory, the American Army Prisoners of War. The force
you so skilfully prepared <a name="page210">
<!-- Begin Page 210 --></a> and forwarded at so much risk, met me
at "Point au Pins" in high spirits and most effective state. Your
thought of clothing the militia in the 41st cast-off clothing
proved a most happy one, it having more than doubled our own
regular force in the enemy's eye. I am not without anxiety about
the Niagara with your scanty means for its defence, notwithstanding
my confidence in your vigilance and admirable address in keeping
the enemy so long in ignorance of my absence and movements, etc.
(Signed) I. BROCK."</p>
<p>There is no need here to allude to the events of the 13th
October, 1812, at Fort George, since they are given in Lieut.-Col.
Evans' own account of that day, to be found at <a href=
"#appendix1">Appendix No. 1</a>, and show that his Generals had
good reason for the esteem in which they held him. Suffice it to
say that in the despatches of General Sheaffe from Queenstown; of
General Vincent from Burlington Heights; of Deputy Adjutant-General
Harvey, Burlington Heights, with reference to the successful attack
on Forty-mile Creek by a wing of the 8th or King's Regiment under
Lieut-Col. Evans; of General Riall, after Chippawa, Fort Erie, and
Lundy's Lane; and of General Drummond, after Lundy's Lane,
Lieut.-Col. Evans is always mentioned with special approbation. And
the same feeling is evident in the public prints of the day,
notably the London <i>Gazette</i>, the official organ, as well as
in histories of the war.</p>
<p>Previous to his removal to Canada with his regiment, Lieut.-Col.
Evans had been officially connected with the Government of
Gibraltar in 1802, at the time that the Duke of Kent, as Governor,
was trying to introduce some much-needed reforms, by doing which he
brought a hornet's nest about his ears. In this affair the Royal
Duke was ably backed by his subordinate, and in 1826, when
Lieut.-Col. Evans was applying for a staff situation in Canada, his
Royal Highness gratefully supported his request.</p>
<p>Brigade-Major Evans' local rank throughout the War of 1812 was
that of Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>
<p>General Evans was an Englishman of Welsh ancestry. He married a
daughter of Mr. Chief Justice Ogden, of Three Rivers, and after
occupying several important appointments, returned to Canada, dying
in Quebec in February, 1863, and was buried with military honours.
His body was afterwards removed to Three Rivers, and lies by the
side of his wife.</p>
<p>Major R. J. Evans, now resident in Toronto, to whom I am
indebted for the above particulars, as also for the valuable paper
to be found elsewhere, is a son of General Evans.</p>

<p>"History has made us somewhat familiar with the settlement of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick by the expatriated Loyalists. Little
has been written of the sufferings and privations endured by 'the
makers' of Upper Canada.</p>
<p>"With the present revival of interest in American history, it is
singular that writers do not awaken a curiosity about the Loyalists
of the Revolution. Students and specialists who have investigated
the story of a flight, equalled only by that of the Huguenots after
the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, have been led to admire the
spirit of unselfish patriotism which led over one hundred thousand
fugitives to self-exile. While the Pilgrim Fathers came to America
leisurely, bringing their household goods and their charters with
them, the United Empire Loyalists, it has been well said, 'bleeding
with the wounds of seven years of war, left ungathered the crops of
their rich farms on the Mohawk and in New Jersey, and, stripped of
every earthly possession, braved the terrors of the unbroken
wilderness from the Mohawk to Lake Ontario.'"&mdash;<i>Jane Meade
Welsh, in Harper's New Monthly for August</i>, 1887.</p>
<p>"1812&mdash;like the characters on the labarum of
Constantine&mdash;is a sign of solemn import to the people of
Canada. It carries with it the virtue of an incantation. Like the
magic numerals of the Arabian sage, these words, in their
utterance, quicken the pulse, and vibrate through the frame,
summoning from the pregnant past memories of suffering and
endurance and of honourable exertion. They are inscribed on the
banner and stamped on the hearts of the Canadian people&mdash;a
watchword rather than a war cry. With these words upon his lips,
the loyal Canadian, as a vigilant sentinel, locks forth into the
gloom, ready with his challenge, hopeful for a friendly response
but prepared for any other. The people of Canada are proud of the
men, and of the deeds, and of the recollections of those days. They
feel that the War of 1812 is an episode in the story of a young
people, glorious, in itself and full of promise. They believe that
the infant which, in its very cradle, could strangle invasion,
struggle and endure bravely and without repining, is capable of a
nobler development, if God wills further trial."&mdash;<i>Coffin's
Chronicles of the War, Chapter I., preamble</i>.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX NO. 5.</h3>
<p>[Mr. Le Moine, in "Quebec Past and Present," states that slavery
was finally abolished in Canada in 1803.] "Near Fort George, less
than a century ago, stood the first Parliament House of Upper
Canada&mdash;a building rude in comparison with the massive pile,
the Bishop's Palace, used for a similar purpose at Quebec&mdash;but
memorable for one at least of the many liberal laws <a name=
"page212"><!-- Begin Page 212 --></a> its homespun representatives
enacted. Here, seventy years before President Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation, the first United Empire Loyalist
Parliament, like the embattled farmers at Concord, 'fired a shot
heard round the world.' For one of the first measures of the exiled
patricians was to pass an act forbidding slavery. Few readers know
that at Newark&mdash;now Niagara, Ontario&mdash;was enacted that
law by which Canada became, not only the first country in the world
to abolish slavery, but as such, a safe refuge for the fugitive
slaves from the Southern States."&mdash;<i>Jane Meade Welsh, in
Harper's New Monthly, August</i>, 1887.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX NO. 6.</h3>
<p>[The Twenty-fourth or Second Warwickshire Regiment, now the
South Wales Borderers, is of ancient and gallant fame. On its
colours are inscribed "Egypt," "Cape of Good Hope," "Talavera,"
"Fuentes d'Onor," "Salamanca," "Vittoria," "Pyrenees," "Nivelle,"
"Orthes," "Peninsula"&mdash;a goodly show.]</p>
<p>To us, perhaps, the claims of the Regiment upon our admiration
are eclipsed by those upon our pity when we remember the terrible
disaster of Isandula in 1879, when six companies of the Regiment
were cut to pieces, and as it was at first feared, the colours
lost. But it was not so; several companies of the 1st Battalion had
fought in the victorious affair of Rorke's Drift the day before,
and "Lieutenant Bromhead" says the <i>Daily News</i> of Feb. 21,
1879: "1st Battalion, 24th Regiment, and Lieutenant Chard, R.E.,
left in charge of the Drift with a company of the 24th Regiment,
first received intimation of the disaster [at Isandula] from
fugitives making for the Drift. Lieutenant Coghill with others rode
away to communicate with Helgmakaar, and were killed by Zulus in
crossing the river."</p>
<p>With Lieutenant Coghill was Lieutenant Melville carrying the
colours. The company holding the Drift was annihilated by the
on-rushing savages, and no tidings of the colours could be gained
until some days after when, behind a mound, were found the bodies
of the two brave Lieutenants, one of whom grasped the pole with
hands stiffened in death and around the other the precious flag was
wound, "safe on the heart of a soldier."</p>
<p>The following touching lines will be welcome to the lover of
noble deeds; it is to be regretted that the name of the poet cannot
also be given:&mdash;</p>

 Washed in the blood of those who died.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Told in their sacred name.<br>

<p>The following which appeared in the Toronto <i>World</i>,
Saturday, July 16, 1887, will also be found of interest to those
whose sympathies have been awakened by the poem:</p>
<center>"NO LONGER THE TWENTY-FOURTH."<br>
<br>
 <i>How the Heroes of Isandklwana came to be called South Wales
Borderers</i>.</center>
<p>"In the London <i>Graphic</i> there have appeared lately several
good articles headed 'Types of the British Army,' with excellent
full-sheet coloured cuts, by eminent artists, of men in marching
order or otherwise belonging to the corps on which the article is
written. The last one is in the <i>Graphic</i> of April 30, being
the fourth to appear, and the picture represents a soldier of the
gallant 24th Regiment. Much has been said by old officers and
soldiers in the press relative to the abolition of the
time-honoured numbers of the old corps, and now this splendid old
regiment is no longer the 24th, but since 1881 is called the 'South
Wales Borderers.' And not only did the historical old <a name=
"page214"><!-- Begin Page 214 --></a> number disappear from the
Army List, according to the new system, but they lost their green
facings, and now wear the white, which all regiments, English and
Welsh, according to the territorial system, have to wear. The Irish
wear green, the Scotch yellow, and all Royal regiments wear blue.
The Artillery and 60th Rifles have red facings, and the Rifle
Brigade black. Corps on the line now go by territorial titles.
First and second battalions and many old regiments are joined to
other old corps which formerly had nothing whatever to do with the
county or province from which they now derive their title." In
connection with this a former captain in the 46th writes to the
Montreal <i>Witness</i> as follows:</p>
<p>"It may be interesting to many to know the reason why regiments
now bear their new titles; and, as the writer was intimately
acquainted with the 24th before the fearful calamity at
Isandhlwana&mdash;where they were annihilated in 1879 by the
Zulus&mdash;and was stationed with them in Brecon, South Wales, he
can give the rather curious origin of their present title.</p>
<p>"Some time before the Zulu campaign, there were many sweeping
changes made in the army, amongst them being the abolition of
numbers, and an order was issued that all members of militia,
yeomanry and volunteers at home should have their adjutants
appointed from officers serving on full pay with the regiments of
cavalry or infantry, and that the artillery, militia and
volunteers, should have their adjutants from the Royal Artillery or
Marine Artillery; the appointment to last for five years, and at
the expiration of that time the officer to return to his corps, and
another one to succeed him. The writer was at that time adjutant of
the 46th Regiment, and the first to be thus appointed to the Royal
Brecon Rifles, South Wales&mdash;a small corps of only four
companies. There was another smaller corps of only two companies in
the adjoining county, Radnorshire, and, perhaps for economy's sake,
it was ordered that both of these corps should be made one
regiment. Each wanted to retain its old militia designation, but it
was decided by the officers to give them a totally new one, and
they were christened the 'South Wales Borderers.'</p>
<p>"Brecon was made a depot centre, and the 24th Regiment were to
recruit and have their depots there. Being then without a title
they took that of the local militia, and are, therefore, now the
'1st and 2nd Battalions South Wales Borderers.' But they will
always be known as the time-honoured 24th, who lost one colonel,
one major, four captains, fourteen lieutenants and seven entire
companies, including band, buglers and drummer boys, at
Isandhlwana. Lieutenants Melville and Coghill, on that occasion,
seeing that all was lost, attempted to save the colours. Melville
was first hit, and Coghill turned back to share his fate. The
colours were afterwards found in the bed of the Buffalo River, and
when brought home Her Majesty tied a small wreath of immortelles on
the staff head at Osborn. They are still in the possession of the
regiment, and the wreath presented by Her Majesty is preserved in a
handsome hermetically-sealed oak box, mounted in silver."</p>

<h3>APPENDIX NO. 7.</h3>
<p>[In his "La Litt&eacute;rature au Canada Fran&ccedil;ais" M.
Bender says of M. L. Pamphile Le May:]</p>
<p>"Le May sings in a clear and tender voice, reminding one of
Alfred de Vigny, and approaching the elegance and polish of that
poet.... In words of melody he celebrates the beauties of rural
life and scenery. He is touching, pleasing and sympathetic. He
knows his subject well; he has seen it, he has felt it, he has
loved it; indeed he yields too much to inspiration, and does not
sufficiently finish his verse, nor does he fully develop his idea
so as to reap all its wealth.... His creations evince originality
and beauty of form." In his preface to "Essais Po&eacute;tiques,"
published 1865, M. Leon P. Le May tells his readers that his
friends discouraged him in his worship of the Muse; they said
verse-making did not pay, that it cost a man too much to devote
himself to an art so little esteemed. But he sang nevertheless, and
Canadian literature in the French language is the richer by much
that is sweet, tender, beautiful and inspiring. We ought to thank
M. Le May for being wiser than his advisers; and such of us as have
not yet considered Canadian Literature worthy of especial regard
would do well to hunt up the numerous volumes that lie all but
unknown upon booksellers' shelves, and convince themselves that
there is a field of intellectual enjoyment open to them of which
they may be justly proud to be the heirs.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
